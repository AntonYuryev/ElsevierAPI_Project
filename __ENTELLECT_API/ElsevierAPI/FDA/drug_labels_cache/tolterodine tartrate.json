      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Urinary Retention: use caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased gastrointestinal motility because of the risk of gastric retention. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: use caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules affect them ( 5.5 ). \u2022 Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 QT Prolongation: consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g., intestinal atony) [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] including dizziness and somnolence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug\u2019s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10-30 mL/min). Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22654% and >placebo) were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Viatris at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The efficacy and safety of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules was evaluated in 1073 patients (537 assigned to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules; 536 assigned to placebo) who were treated with 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/day for up to 15 months. These included a total of 1012 patients (505 randomized to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. A serious adverse event was reported by 1.4% (n=7) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and by 3.6% (n=18) of patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists the adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study at an incidence greater than placebo and in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily.

Similar percentages of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation among patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [n=12 (2.4%) vs. placebo n=6 (1.2%)]. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General: anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular: tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Gastrointestinal: diarrhea; Central/Peripheral Nervous: confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

Reduce tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules dose to 2 mg once daily. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Other Anticholinergics (antimuscarinics): Concomitant use with other anticholinergic agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, or ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Other Interactions No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with diuretics [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.4 Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.5 Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. 7.6 Other Anticholinergics The concomitant use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, somnolence, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects.",
      "Drug Interactions Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Warfarin In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g/levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of Tolterodine on Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment: Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with CCr <10 mL/min. Dose adjustment in severe renal impairment (CCr: 10-30 mL/min). ( 8.6 ) \u2022 Hepatic Impairment: Not recommended for use in severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C). Dose adjustment in mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A, B). ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules use in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite to pregnant mice during organogenesis did not produce adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day; however, higher doses produced adverse developmental outcomes (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No anomalies or malformations were observed after oral administration of tolterodine to pregnant mice during organogenesis at approximately 9-12 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on the AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day). At 14-18 times the clinical exposure (doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day) in mice, tolterodine was embryo-lethal, caused reduced fetal weight, and increased the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification). Pregnant rabbits administered tolterodine subcutaneously at about 0.3-2.5 times the clinical exposure (dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day) did not show any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of tolterodine or its 5-HMT metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Based on limited data, tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice in low amounts (see Data ) . The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data The use of radiolabeled tolterodine in pregnant mice produced milk: plasma ratios that ranged between 0.0 and 0.7. 8.4 Pediatric Use The effectiveness of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules has not been established in pediatric patients. Efficacy was not established in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies that enrolled 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 224 on placebo) aged 5\u201310 years with urinary frequency and urge incontinence. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients treated with tolterodine. In multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of 5-HMT were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another clinical study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than concentrations reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in the Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended. 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine and 5-HMT levels were approximately 2\u20133 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine, and N -dealkylated hydroxy tolterodine) were significantly higher (10\u201330 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dose for patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10-30 mL/min) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg daily. Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules have not been studied in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [CCr 30-80 mL/min]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study of tolterodine immediate release conducted in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh Class A and B), the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18\u201355 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine immediate release (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QT c ) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia\u2019s (QT c F) and a population-specific (QT c P) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (CI) change in QTc from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) Drug/Dose N QT c F (msec) (manual) QT c F (msec) (machine) QT c P (msec) (manual) QT c P (msec) (machine) Tolterodine 2 mg BID At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval. 48 5.01 (0.28, 9.74) 1.16 (-2.99, 5.30) 4.45 (-0.37, 9.26) 2.00 (-1.81, 5.81) Tolterodine 4 mg BID 48 11.84 (7.11, 16.58) 5.63 (1.48, 9.77) 10.31 (5.49, 15.12) 8.34 (4.53, 12.15) Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval. 45 19.26 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs. (15.49, 23.03) 8.90 (4.77, 13.03) 19.10 (15.32, 22.89) 9.29 (5.34, 13.24) The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine\u2019s effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QT c interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\u201cactive moiety\u201d), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d) is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \u201cextensive metabolizers.\u201d Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (< 2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3.

In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Warfarin In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g/levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of Tolterodine on Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18\u201355 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine immediate release (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QT c ) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia\u2019s (QT c F) and a population-specific (QT c P) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (CI) change in QTc from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) Drug/Dose N QT c F (msec) (manual) QT c F (msec) (machine) QT c P (msec) (manual) QT c P (msec) (machine) Tolterodine 2 mg BID At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval. 48 5.01 (0.28, 9.74) 1.16 (-2.99, 5.30) 4.45 (-0.37, 9.26) 2.00 (-1.81, 5.81) Tolterodine 4 mg BID 48 11.84 (7.11, 16.58) 5.63 (1.48, 9.77) 10.31 (5.49, 15.12) 8.34 (4.53, 12.15) Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval. 45 19.26 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs. (15.49, 23.03) 8.90 (4.77, 13.03) 19.10 (15.32, 22.89) 9.29 (5.34, 13.24) The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine\u2019s effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QT c interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] ."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\u201cactive moiety\u201d), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d) is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \u201cextensive metabolizers.\u201d Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (< 2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3.

In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Warfarin In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g/levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of Tolterodine on Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), exposure margins were approximately 6-9 times, 7 times, and 11 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite). At these exposure margins, no increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic or genotoxic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli , a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (about 9-12 times the clinical exposure via AUC), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg were evaluated in 29 patients in a Phase 2 dose-effect study. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence and frequency in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3, 12-week study. A total of 507 patients received tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily in the morning and 508 received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (81%), with a mean age of 61 years (range, 20 to 93 years). In the study, 642 patients (42%) were 65 to 93 years of age. The study included patients known to be responsive to tolterodine immediate release and other anticholinergic medications, however, 47% of patients never received prior pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder. At study entry, 97% of patients had at least 5 urge incontinence episodes per week and 91% of patients had 8 or more micturitions per day. The primary efficacy assessment was change in mean number of incontinence episodes per week at week 12 from baseline. Secondary efficacy measures included change in mean number of micturitions per day and mean volume voided per micturition at week 12 from baseline. Patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules experienced a statistically significant decrease in number of urinary incontinence per week from baseline to last assessment (week 12) compared with placebo as well as a decrease in the average daily urinary frequency and an increase in the average urine volume per void. Mean change from baseline in weekly incontinence episodes, urinary frequency, and volume voided between placebo and tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are summarized in Table 4.

( 5.5 ) Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. ( 5.8 ) QT Prolongation: consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g. intestinal atony) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] including dizziness and somnolence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug\u2019s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended release-capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS(8.6) ]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10-30 mL/min). Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7) ] . 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction . 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) ] , the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine immediate release tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules."

      "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence > 4% and >placebo) were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Inventia Healthcare Limited, at 1-800-270-7585 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The efficacy and safety of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules was evaluated in 1073 patients (537 assigned to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules; 536 assigned to placebo) who were treated with 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/day for up to 15 months. These included a total of 1012 patients (505 randomized to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. A serious adverse event was reported by 1.4% (n=7) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and by 3.6% (n=18) of patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists the adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study at an incidence greater than placebo and in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily.

Similar percentages of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation among patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [n=12 (2.4%) vs. placebo n=6 (1.2%)]. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General: anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular: tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Gastrointestinal : diarrhea ; Central/Peripheral Nervous: confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

( 7.6 ) 7.1 Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.1) ] . The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.2 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin or ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended release capsules is 2 mg once daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ] . 7.3 Other interactions No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with diuretics [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.4 Other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.5 Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. 7.6 Other Anticholinergics The concomitant use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, somnolence and other anticholienrgic pharmacological effects."

      "8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with CCr <10 mL/min. Dose adjustment in severe renal impairment (CCr: 10-30 mL/min). ( 8.6 ) Hepatic Impairment: Not recommended for use in severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Dose adjustment in mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B). ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules use in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite to pregnant mice during organogenesis did not produce adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day; however, higher doses produced adverse developmental outcomes (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No anomalies or malformations were observed after oral administration of tolterodine to pregnant mice during organogenesis at approximately 9-12 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on the AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day). At 1418 times the clinical exposure (doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day) in mice, tolterodine was embryo-lethal, caused reduced fetal weight, and increased the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification). Pregnant rabbits administered tolterodine subcutaneously at about 0.3-2.5 times the clinical exposure (dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day) did not show any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of tolterodine or its 5-HMT metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Based on limited data, tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice in low amounts ( see Data ). The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data The use of radiolabeled tolterodine in pregnant mice produced milk: plasma ratios that ranged between 0.0 and 0.7. 8.4 Pediatric Use The effectiveness of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules has not been established in pediatric patients. Efficacy was not established in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies that enrolled 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 224 on placebo) aged 5\u201310 years with urinary frequency and urge incontinence. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients treated with tolterodine. In multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of 5-HMT were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another clinical study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than concentrations reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in the Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended. 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine and 5-HMT levels were approximately 2\u20133 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N- dealkylated tolterodine and N -dealkylated hydroxy tolterodine) were significantly higher (10\u201330 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dose for patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10-30 mL/min) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg daily. Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5.6) ] .Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules have not been studied in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [CCr 30-80 mL/min]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study of tolterodine immediate release conducted in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh Class A and B), the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine tartrate immediate release (tolterodine IR) tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18\u201355 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) ]. QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QT c ) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia's (QT c F) and a population-specific (QT c P) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (CI) change in QT c from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) at T max (relative to placebo) * At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval. \u2020 At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval. \u2021 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs.

The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine's effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QT c interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\"active moiety\"), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food: There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (< 2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3 Summary of Mean (\u00b1SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Tolterodine Extended Release and its Active Metabolite (5-Hydroxymethyl Tolterodine) in Healthy Volunteers C max = Maximum serum concentration; t max = Time of occurrence of Cmax; C avg = Average serum concentration; t 1/2 = Terminal elimination half-life. * Parameter dose-normalized from 8 to 4 mg for the single-dose data. \u2020Data presented as median (range). \u2021 = not applicable.

In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors : The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) ] . Warfarin : In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives : Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u03bcg/levo-norgestrel 150 \u03bcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes: Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (K i 1.05 \u03bcM), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine tartrate immediate release (tolterodine IR) tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18\u201355 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) ]. QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QT c ) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia's (QT c F) and a population-specific (QT c P) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others.

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\"active moiety\"), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food: There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (< 2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM).

In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors : The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) ] . Warfarin : In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives : Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u03bcg/levo-norgestrel 150 \u03bcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes: Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (K i 1.05 \u03bcM), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg was evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence and frequency in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3, 12-week study. A total of 507 patients received tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily in the morning and 508 received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (81%), with a mean age of 61 years (range, 20 to 93 years). In the study, 642 patients (42%) were 65 to 93 years of age. The study included patients known to be responsive to tolterodine immediate release and other anticholinergic medications, however, 47% of patients never received prior pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder. At study entry, 97% of patients had at least 5 urge incontinence episodes per week and 91% of patients had 8 or more micturitions per day. The primary efficacy assessment was change in mean number of incontinence episodes per week at week 12 from baseline. Secondary efficacy measures included change in mean number of micturitions per day and mean volume voided per micturition at week 12 from baseline. Patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules experienced a statistically significant decrease in number of urinary incontinence per week from baseline to last assessment (week 12) compared with placebo as well as a decrease in the average daily urinary frequency and an increase in the average urine volume per void. Mean change from baseline in weekly incontinence episodes, urinary frequency, and volume voided between placebo and tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are summarized in Table 4.

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Tolterodine Tartrate Extended-release Capsules, USP (tol ter\u2019 oh deen tar\u2019 trate) 2 mg and 4 mg Read the Patient Information that comes with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules before you start using it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your condition or your treatment. Only your doctor can determine if treatment with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is right for you. What are tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules? Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are a prescription medicine for adults used to treat the following symptoms due to a condition called overactive bladder : Having a strong need to urinate with leaking or wetting accidents (urge urinary incontinence). Having a strong need to urinate right away (urgency). Having to urinate often (frequency). Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules did not help the symptoms of overactive bladder when studied in children. What is overactive bladder? Overactive bladder happens when you cannot control your bladder muscle. When the muscle contracts too often or cannot be controlled, you get symptoms of overactive bladder, which are leakage of urine (urge urinary incontinence), needing to urinate right away (urgency), and needing to urinate often (frequency). Who should not take tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules? Do not take tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules if: You have trouble emptying your bladder (also called \"urinary retention\"). Your stomach empties slowly (also called \"gastric retention\"). You have an eye problem called \"uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma\". You are allergic to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or to any of its ingredients. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, a major pharmacologically active metabolite. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. Tolterodine immediate release is rapidly absorbed, and maximum serum concentrations (C max ) typically occur within 1 to 2 hours after dose administration. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Effect of Food: Food intake increases the bioavailability of tolterodine (average increase 53%), but does not affect the levels of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive metabolizers. This change is not expected to be a safety concern and adjustment of dose is not needed. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b11-acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N-dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset (about 7%) of the population is devoid of CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite of tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N-dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 1. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine 4 mg administered twice daily to 16 healthy male volunteers (8 EM, 8 PM). Table 1.

Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: In Phase 1, multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another Phase 1 study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ). Pediatric: The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine have not been established in pediatric patients. Gender: The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are not influenced by gender. Mean C max of tolterodine (1.6 \u00b5g/L in males versus 2.2 \u00b5g/L in females) and the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (2.2 \u00b5g/L in males versus 2.5 \u00b5g/L in females) are similar in males and females who were administered tolterodine immediate release 2 mg. Mean AUC values of tolterodine (6.7 \u00b5g\u2022h/L in males versus 7.8 \u00b5g\u2022h/L in females) and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (10 \u00b5g\u2022h/L in males versus 11 \u00b5g\u2022h/L in females) are also similar. The elimination half-life of tolterodine for both males and females is 2.4 hours, and the half-life of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is 3.0 hours in females and 3.3 hours in males. Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been established. Renal Insufficiency: Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite levels were approximately 2\u20133 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine, and N-dealkylated hydroxylated tolterodine) were significantly higher (10\u201330 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dosage for patients with significantly reduced renal function is tolterodine tartrate 1 mg twice daily (see PRECAUTIONS , General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency: Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study conducted in cirrhotic patients, the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with significantly reduced hepatic function is tolterodine tartrate 1 mg twice daily (see PRECAUTIONS , General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug-Drug Interactions Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine tartrate and fluoxetine are coadministered. Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes: Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes. CYP3A4 Inhibitors: The effect of 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were poor metabolizers (see Pharmacokinetics , Variability in Metabolism for discussion of poor metabolizers). In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2 and 2.5 fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Warfarin: In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives: Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g/levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel over a 2-month cycle in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine immediate release (IR) on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18\u201355 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QTc) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia\u2019s (QTcF) and a population-specific (QTcP) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2.

The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine\u2019s effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QTc interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended release capsules (see PRECAUTIONS , Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation )."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tartrate tablets were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies. A total of 853 patients received tolterodine tartrate 2 mg twice daily and 685 patients received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (78%), with a mean age of 60 years (range, 19 to 93 years). At study entry, nearly all patients perceived they had urgency and most patients had increased frequency of micturitions and urge incontinence. These characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups for the studies. The efficacy endpoints for study 007 (see Table 3) included the change from baseline for: \u2022 Number of incontinence episodes per week \u2022 Number of micturitions per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days) \u2022 Volume of urine voided per micturition (averaged over 2 days) The efficacy endpoints for studies 008, 009, and 010 (see Table 4) were identical to the above endpoints with the exception that the number of incontinence episodes was per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days).

      "WARNINGS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Risk of Urinary Retention and Gastric Retention: Tolterodine tartrate tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention and to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders, such as pyloric stenosis, because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility: Tolterodine tartrate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Tolterodine tartrate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects: Tolterodine tartrate is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects including dizziness and somnolence (see Adverse Reactions). Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug\u2019s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Reduced Hepatic and Renal Function: For patients with significantly reduced hepatic function or renal function, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate is 1 mg twice daily (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations ). Myasthenia Gravis: Tolterodine tartrate should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Cardiac Electrophysiology ), the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate for patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that antimuscarinic agents such as tolterodine tartrate tablets may produce the following effects: blurred vision, dizziness, or drowsiness. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until the drug's effects have been determined. Drug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, significantly increased plasma concentrations of tolterodine when coadministered to subjects who were poor metabolizers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Variability in Metabolism and Drug-Drug Interactions ). For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate is 1 mg twice daily (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug- Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), AUC values obtained for tolterodine were 355, 291, and 462 \u00b5g\u2022h/L, respectively. In comparison, the human AUC value for a 2 mg dose administered twice daily is estimated at 34 \u00b5g\u2022h/L. Thus, tolterodine exposure in the carcinogenicity studies was 9- to 14-fold higher than expected in humans. No increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli , a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (corresponding to AUC value of about 500 \u00b5g\u2022h/L), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. Based on AUC values, the systemic exposure was about 15-fold higher in animals than in humans. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. At oral doses of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 14 times the human exposure), no anomalies or malformations were observed in mice. When given at doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day, tolterodine has been shown to be embryolethal, reduce fetal weight, and increase the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification) in mice. At these doses, the AUC values were about 20- to 25-fold higher than in humans. Rabbits treated subcutaneously at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day achieved an AUC of 100 \u00b5g\u2022h/L, which is about 3-fold higher than that resulting from the human dose. This dose did not result in any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. There are no studies of tolterodine in pregnant women. Therefore, tolterodine tartrate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice. Offspring of female mice treated with tolterodine 20 mg/kg/day during the lactation period had slightly reduced body weight gain. The offspring regained the weight during the maturation phase. It is not known whether tolterodine is excreted in human milk; therefore, tolterodine tartrate should not be administered during nursing. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue tolterodine tartrate in nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Efficacy in the pediatric population has not been demonstrated. Two pediatric phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies were conducted using tolterodine extended release (DETROL LA) capsules. A total of 710 pediatric patients (486 on DETROL LA and 224 on placebo) aged 5\u201310 years with urinary frequency and urge urinary incontinence were studied. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with DETROL LA (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with DETROL LA compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. Geriatric Use Of the 1120 patients who were treated in the four Phase 3, 12-week clinical studies of tolterodine tartrate, 474 (42%) were 65 to 91 years of age. No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations )."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Risk of Urinary Retention and Gastric Retention: Tolterodine tartrate tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention and to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders, such as pyloric stenosis, because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility: Tolterodine tartrate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Tolterodine tartrate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects: Tolterodine tartrate is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects including dizziness and somnolence (see Adverse Reactions). Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug\u2019s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Reduced Hepatic and Renal Function: For patients with significantly reduced hepatic function or renal function, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate is 1 mg twice daily (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations ). Myasthenia Gravis: Tolterodine tartrate should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Cardiac Electrophysiology ), the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate for patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules."

For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate is 1 mg twice daily (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), AUC values obtained for tolterodine were 355, 291, and 462 \u00b5g\u2022h/L, respectively. In comparison, the human AUC value for a 2 mg dose administered twice daily is estimated at 34 \u00b5g\u2022h/L. Thus, tolterodine exposure in the carcinogenicity studies was 9- to 14-fold higher than expected in humans. No increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli , a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (corresponding to AUC value of about 500 \u00b5g\u2022h/L), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. Based on AUC values, the systemic exposure was about 15-fold higher in animals than in humans. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility."
    ],
    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. At oral doses of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 14 times the human exposure), no anomalies or malformations were observed in mice. When given at doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day, tolterodine has been shown to be embryolethal, reduce fetal weight, and increase the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification) in mice. At these doses, the AUC values were about 20- to 25-fold higher than in humans. Rabbits treated subcutaneously at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day achieved an AUC of 100 \u00b5g\u2022h/L, which is about 3-fold higher than that resulting from the human dose. This dose did not result in any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. There are no studies of tolterodine in pregnant women. Therefore, tolterodine tartrate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial program for tolterodine tartrate tablets included 3071 patients who were treated with tolterodine tartrate (N=2133) or placebo (N=938). The patients were treated with 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/day for up to 12 months. No differences in the safety profile of tolterodine were identified based on age, gender, race, or metabolism. The data described below reflect exposure to tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five Phase 3, controlled clinical studies. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and approximating rates. Sixty-six percent of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid reported adverse events versus 56% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate were dry mouth, headache, constipation, vertigo/dizziness, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and xerophthalmia are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid in the Phase 3 clinical studies, occurring in 34.8% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate and 9.8% of placebo-treated patients. One percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate discontinued treatment due to dry mouth. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Seven percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid discontinued treatment due to adverse events versus 6% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of tolterodine tartrate were dizziness and headache. Three percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid reported a serious adverse event versus 4% of placebo patients. Significant ECG changes in QT and QTc have not been demonstrated in clinical-study patients treated with tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid. Table 5 lists the adverse events reported in 1% or more of the patients treated with tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid in the 12-week studies. The adverse events are reported regardless of causality.

Post-marketing Surveillance The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General: anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular: tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Central/Peripheral Nervous: confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your condition or your treatment. Only your doctor can determine if treatment with tolterodine tartrate is right for you. What are tolterodine tartrate tablets? Tolterodine tartrate tablets are a prescription medicine for adults used to treat the following symptoms due to a condition called overactive bladder : \u2022 Urge urinary incontinence: a strong need to urinate with leaking or wetting accidents. \u2022 Urgency: a strong need to urinate right away. \u2022 Frequency: urinating often DETROL LA (tolterodine tartrate extended release capsules) did not help the symptoms of overactive bladder when studied in children. What is overactive bladder? Overactive bladder happens when you cannot control your bladder muscle. When the muscle contracts too often or cannot be controlled, you get symptoms of overactive bladder, which are leakage of urine (urge urinary incontinence), needing to urinate right away (urgency), and needing to urinate often (frequency). Who should not take tolterodine tartrate tablets? Do not take tolterodine tartrate tablets if you: \u2022 Are not able to empty your bladder (urinary retention) \u2022 Have delayed or slow emptying of your stomach (gastric retention) \u2022 Have an eye problem called \u201cuncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma\u201d \u2022 Are allergic to tolterodine tartrate tablets or to any of its ingredients.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, a major pharmacologically active metabolite. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. Tolterodine immediate release is rapidly absorbed, and maximum serum concentrations (C max ) typically occur within 1 to 2 hours after dose administration. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Effect of Food: Food intake increases the bioavailability of tolterodine (average increase 53%), but does not affect the levels of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive metabolizers. This change is not expected to be a safety concern and adjustment of dose is not needed. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism : A subset (about 7%) of the population is devoid of CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite of tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 1. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine 4 mg administered twice daily to 16 healthy male volunteers (8 EM, 8 PM). Table 1.

In another Phase 1 study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ). Pediatric : The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine have not been established in pediatric patients. Gender: The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are not influenced by gender. Mean C max of tolterodine (1.6 \u03bcg/L in males versus 2.2 \u03bcg/L in females) and the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (2.2 \u03bcg/L in males versus 2.5 \u03bcg/L in females) are similar in males and females who were administered tolterodine immediate release 2 mg. Mean AUC values of tolterodine (6.7 \u03bcg\u00b7h/L in males versus 7.8 \u03bcg\u00b7h/L in females) and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (10 \u03bcg\u00b7h/L in males versus 11 \u03bcg\u00b7h/L in females) are also similar. The elimination half-life of tolterodine for both males and females is 2.4 hours, and the half-life of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is 3.0 hours in females and 3.3 hours in males. Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been established. Renal Insufficiency: Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite levels were approximately 2\u20133 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N-dealkylated tolterodine acid, N-dealkylated tolterodine, and N-dealkylated hydroxylated tolterodine) were significantly higher (10\u201330 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dosage for patients with significantly reduced renal function is tolterodine tartrate tablets 1 mg twice daily (see PRECAUTIONS, General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency: Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study conducted in cirrhotic patients, the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with significantly reduced hepatic function is tolterodine tartrate tablets 1 mg twice daily (see PRECAUTIONS, General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug-Drug Interactions Fluoxetine : Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine tartrate and fluoxetine are coadministered. Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes : Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u03bcM), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes. CYP3A4 Inhibitors: The effect of 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were poor metabolizers (see Pharmacokinetics, Variability in Metabolism for discussion of poor metabolizers). In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2 and 2.5 fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Warfarin: In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives: Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u03bcg/levonorgestrel 150 \u03bcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel over a 2 month cycle in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine immediate release (IR) on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18\u201355 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QTc) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia's (QTcF) and a population-specific (QTcP) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (CI) change in QTc from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) at T max (relative to placebo) 1 At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval 2 At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval 3 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs. Drug/Dose (manual) N QTcF (msec) (manual) QTcF (msec) (machine) QTcP (msec) (manual) QTcP (msec) (machine) Tolterodine 2 mg BID 1 48 5.01 (0.28, 9.74) 1.16 (-2.99, 5.30) 4.45 (-0.37, 9.26) 2.00 (-1.81, 5.81) Tolterodine 4 mg BID 1 48 11.84 (7.11, 16.58) 5.63 (1.48, 9.77) 10.31 (5.49, 15.12) 8.34 (4.53, 12.15) Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD 2 45 19.26 3 (15.49, 23.03) 8.90 (4.77, 13.03) 19.10 3 (15.32, 22.89) 9.29 (5.34, 13.24) The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine's effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QTc interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (see PRECAUTIONS, Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation )."

      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. Tolterodine immediate release is rapidly absorbed, and maximum serum concentrations (C max ) typically occur within 1 to 2 hours after dose administration. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Effect of Food: Food intake increases the bioavailability of tolterodine (average increase 53%), but does not affect the levels of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive metabolizers. This change is not expected to be a safety concern and adjustment of dose is not needed. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism : A subset (about 7%) of the population is devoid of CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite of tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 1. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine 4 mg administered twice daily to 16 healthy male volunteers (8 EM, 8 PM). Table 1.

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tartrate tablets were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies. A total of 853 patients received tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg twice daily and 685 patients received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (78%), with a mean age of 60 years (range, 19 to 93 years). At study entry, nearly all patients perceived they had urgency and most patients had increased frequency of micturitions and urge incontinence. These characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups for the studies. The efficacy endpoints for study 007 (see Table 3) included the change from baseline for: Number of incontinence episodes per week Number of micturitions per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days) Volume of urine voided per micturition (averaged over 2 days) The efficacy endpoints for studies 008, 009, and 010 (see Table 4) were identical to the above endpoints with the exception that the number of incontinence episodes was per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days).

    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Tolterodine tartrate tablets are contraindicated in patients with urinary retention, gastric retention, or uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma. Tolterodine tartrate is also contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients, or to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets which, like tolterodine tartrate, are metabolized to 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Risk of Urinary Retention and Gastric Retention: Tolterodine tartrate tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention and to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders, such as pyloric stenosis, because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility: Tolterodine tartrate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Tolterodine tartrate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects : Tolterodine tartrate is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects including dizziness and somnolence (see Adverse Reactions). Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug's effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Reduced Hepatic and Renal Function: For patients with significantly reduced hepatic function or renal function, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate is 1 mg twice daily (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations ). Myasthenia Gravis: Tolterodine tartrate should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Cardiac Electrophysiology ), the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate for patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended release capsules. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that antimuscarinic agents such as tolterodine tartrate may produce the following effects: blurred vision, dizziness, or drowsiness. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until the drug's effects have been determined. Drug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, significantly increased plasma concentrations of tolterodine when coadministered to subjects who were poor metabolizers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Variability in Metabolism and Drug-Drug Interactions ). For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate is 1 mg twice daily (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), AUC values obtained for tolterodine were 355, 291, and 462 \u03bcg h/L, respectively. In comparison, the human AUC value for a 2 mg dose administered twice daily is estimated at 34 \u03bcg h/L. Thus, tolterodine exposure in the carcinogenicity studies was 9- to 14-fold higher than expected in humans. No increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli, a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (corresponding to AUC value of about 500 \u03bcg h/L), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. Based on AUC values, the systemic exposure was about 15-fold higher in animals than in humans. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. At oral doses of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 14 times the human exposure), no anomalies or malformations were observed in mice. When given at doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day, tolterodine has been shown to be embryolethal, reduce fetal weight, and increase the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification) in mice. At these doses, the AUC values were about 20- to 25-fold higher than in humans. Rabbits treated subcutaneously at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day achieved an AUC of 100 \u03bcg h/L, which is about 3-fold higher than that resulting from the human dose. This dose did not result in any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. There are no studies of tolterodine in pregnant women. Therefore, tolterodine tartrate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice. Offspring of female mice treated with tolterodine 20 mg/kg/day during the lactation period had slightly reduced body weight gain. The offspring regained the weight during the maturation phase. It is not known whether tolterodine is excreted in human milk; therefore, tolterodine tartrate should not be administered during nursing. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue tolterodine tartrate in nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Efficacy in the pediatric population has not been demonstrated. Two pediatric phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies were conducted using tolterodine extended release capsules. A total of 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended release capsules and 224 on placebo) aged 5\u201310 years with urinary frequency and urge urinary incontinence were studied. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. Geriatric Use Of the 1120 patients who were treated in the four Phase 3, 12-week clinical studies of tolterodine tartrate, 474 (42%) were 65 to 91 years of age. No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations )."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial program for tolterodine tartrate tablets included 3071 patients who were treated with tolterodine tartrate (N=2133) or placebo (N=938). The patients were treated with 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/day for up to 12 months. No differences in the safety profile of tolterodine were identified based on age, gender, race, or metabolism. The data described below reflect exposure to tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five Phase 3, controlled clinical studies. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and approximating rates. Sixty-six percent of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid reported adverse events versus 56% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate were dry mouth, headache, constipation, vertigo/dizziness, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and xerophthalmia are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid in the Phase 3 clinical studies, occurring in 34.8% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate and 9.8% of placebo-treated patients. One percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate discontinued treatment due to dry mouth. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Seven percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid discontinued treatment due to adverse events versus 6% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of tolterodine tartrate were dizziness and headache. Three percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid reported a serious adverse event versus 4% of placebo patients. Significant ECG changes in QT and QTc have not been demonstrated in clinical-study patients treated with tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid. Table 5 lists the adverse events reported in 1% or more of the patients treated with tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid in the 12-week studies. The adverse events are reported regardless of causality.

Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

The child fully recovered. Management of Overdosage Overdosage with tolterodine tartrate can potentially result in severe central anticholinergic effects and should be treated accordingly. ECG monitoring is recommended in the event of overdosage. In dogs, changes in the QT interval (slight prolongation of 10% to 20%) were observed at a suprapharmacologic dose of 4.5 mg/kg, which is about 68 times higher than the recommended human dose. In clinical trials of normal volunteers and patients, QT interval prolongation was observed with tolterodine immediate release at doses up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) and higher doses were not evaluated (see PRECAUTIONS, Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation )."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: use caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased gastrointestinal motility because of the risk of gastric retention. ( 5.3 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: use caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.4 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules affect them. ( 5.5 ) Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. ( 5.8 ) QT Prolongation: consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g., intestinal atony) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] including dizziness and somnolence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug's effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6) ]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min). Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7) ]. 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) ], the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate immediate release tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22654% and >placebo) were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Torrent Pharma Inc. at 1-800-912-9561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The efficacy and safety of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules was evaluated in 1,073 patients (537 assigned to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules; 536 assigned to placebo) who were treated with 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/day for up to 15 months. These included a total of 1,012 patients (505 randomized to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. A serious adverse event was reported by 1.4% (n=7) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and by 3.6% (n=18) of patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists the adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study at an incidence greater than placebo and in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily. Table 1. Incidence in nearest integer.

Similar percentages of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation among patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [n=12 (2.4%) vs. placebo n=6 (1.2%)]. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General: anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular: tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Gastrointestinal: diarrhea; Central/Peripheral Nervous: confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

Reduce tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules dose to 2 mg once daily. ( 7.2 ) Other Anticholinergics (antimuscarinics): Concomitant use with other anticholinergic agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.1) ]. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.2 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, or ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.3 Other Interactions No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with diuretics [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.4 Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.5 Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. 7.6 Other Anticholinergics The concomitant use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, somnolence, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with CCr <10 mL/min. Dose adjustment in severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min). ( 8.6 ) Hepatic Impairment: Not recommended for use in severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C). Dose adjustment in mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A, B). ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules use in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite to pregnant mice during organogenesis did not produce adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day; however, higher doses produced adverse developmental outcomes (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No anomalies or malformations were observed after oral administration of tolterodine to pregnant mice during organogenesis at approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on the AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day). At 14 to 18 times the clinical exposure (doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day) in mice, tolterodine was embryo-lethal, caused reduced fetal weight, and increased the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification). Pregnant rabbits administered tolterodine subcutaneously at about 0.3 to 2.5 times the clinical exposure (dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day) did not show any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of tolterodine or its 5-HMT metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Based on limited data, tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice in low amounts (see Data) . The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data The use of radiolabeled tolterodine in pregnant mice produced milk: plasma ratios that ranged between 0.0 and 0.7. 8.4 Pediatric Use The effectiveness of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules has not been established in pediatric patients. Efficacy was not established in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies that enrolled 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 224 on placebo) aged 5 to 10 years with urinary frequency and urge incontinence. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients treated with tolterodine. In multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of 5-HMT were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another clinical study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than concentrations reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in the Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended. 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine and 5-HMT levels were approximately 2 to 3 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N- dealkylated tolterodine, and N -dealkylated hydroxy tolterodine) were significantly higher (10 to 30 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dose for patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg daily. Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6) ]. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules have not been studied in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [CCr 30 to 80 mL/min]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study of tolterodine immediate release conducted in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh Class A and B), the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ]."

In multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of 5-HMT were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another clinical study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than concentrations reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in the Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules can potentially result in severe central anticholinergic effects and should be treated accordingly. ECG monitoring is recommended in the event of overdosage. In dogs, changes in the QT interval (slight prolongation of 10% to 20%) were observed at a suprapharmacologic dose of 4.5 mg/kg, which is about 68 times higher than the recommended human dose. In clinical trials of normal volunteers and patients, QT interval prolongation was observed with tolterodine immediate release at doses up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) and higher doses were not evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) ]. A 27-month-old child who ingested 5 to 7 tolterodine immediate release 2 mg tablets was treated with a suspension of activated charcoal and was hospitalized overnight with symptoms of dry mouth. The child fully recovered."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine tartrate immediate release (tolterodine IR) tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) ]. QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QTc) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia's (QT c F) and a population-specific (QT c P) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (Cl) change in QTc from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) at T max (relative to placebo) Drug/Dose N QT c F (msec) (manual) QT c F (msec) (machine) QT c P (msec) (manual) QT c P (msec) (machine) Tolterodine 2 mg BID At Tmax of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval. 48 5.01 (0.28, 9.74) 1.16 (-2.99, 5.30) 4.45 (-0.37, 9.26) 2.00 (-1.81, 5.81) Tolterodine 4 mg BID 48 11.84 (7.11, 16.58) 5.63 (1.48, 9.77) 10.31 (5.49, 15.12) 8.34 (4.53, 12.15) Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD At Tmax of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval. 45 19.26 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs. (15.49, 23.03) 8.90 (4.77, 13.03) 19.10 (15.32, 22.89) 9.29 (5.34, 13.24) The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine's effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QT c interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate immediate-release tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\"active moiety\"), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food: There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3.

In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) ]. Warfarin: In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives: Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg/levo-norgestrel 150 mcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes: Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (K i 1.05 \u03bcM), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), exposure margins were approximately 6 to 9 times, 7 times, and 11 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite). At these exposure margins, no increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic or genotoxic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli , a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (about 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure via AUC), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility."

The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (81%), with a mean age of 61 years (range, 20 to 93 years). In the study, 642 patients (42%) were 65 to 93 years of age. The study included patients known to be responsive to tolterodine immediate release and other anticholinergic medications, however, 47% of patients never received prior pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder. At study entry, 97% of patients had at least 5 urge incontinence episodes per week and 91% of patients had 8 or more micturitions per day. The primary efficacy assessment was change in mean number of incontinence episodes per week at week 12 from baseline. Secondary efficacy measures included change in mean number of micturitions per day and mean volume voided per micturition at week 12 from baseline. Patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules experienced a statistically significant decrease in number of urinary incontinence per week from baseline to last assessment (week 12) compared with placebo as well as a decrease in the average daily urinary frequency and an increase in the average urine volume per void. Mean change from baseline in weekly incontinence episodes, urinary frequency, and volume voided between placebo and tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are summarized in Table 4.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: use caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased gastrointestinal motility because of the risk of gastric retention. ( 5.3 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: use caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.4 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules affects them ( 5.5 ). Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. ( 5.8 ) QT Prolongation : consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g., intestinal atony) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ] . 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ] . 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] including dizziness and somnolence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug's effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6) ]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 30 mL/min). Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7) ] . 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) ] , the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with DETROL or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence > 4% and >placebo) were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Unichem Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. at 1-866-562-4616 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The efficacy and safety of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules was evaluated in 1073 patients (537 assigned to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules; 536 assigned to placebo) who were treated with 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/day for up to 15 months. These included a total of 1012 patients (505 randomized to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. A serious adverse event was reported by 1.4% (n=7) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and by 3.6% (n=18) of patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists the adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study at an incidence greater than placebo and in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily.

The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Similar percentages of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation among patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [n=12 (2.4%) vs. placebo n=6 (1.2%)]. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General: anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular: tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Gastrointestinal: diarrhea ; Central/Peripheral Nervous: confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

Reduce tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules dose to 2 mg once daily. ( 7.2 ) Other Anticholinergics (antimuscarinics): Concomitant use with other anticholinergic agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in Cmax and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.1) ] . The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.2 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean Cmax and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, or ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION(2.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ] . 7.3 Other Interactions No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with diuretics [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.4 Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.5 Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. 7.6 Other Anticholinergics The concomitant use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, somnolence, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with CCr <10 mL/min. Dose adjustment in severe renal impairment (CCr: 10-30 mL/min). ( 8.6 ) Hepatic Impairment: Not recommended for use in severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C). Dose adjustment in mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A, B). ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules use in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite to pregnant mice during organogenesis did not produce adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day; however, higher doses produced adverse developmental outcomes (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No anomalies or malformations were observed after oral administration of tolterodine to pregnant mice during organogenesis at approximately 9-12 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on the AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day). At 14 18 times the clinical exposure (doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day) in mice, tolterodine was embryo-lethal, caused reduced fetal weight, and increased the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification). Pregnant rabbits administered tolterodine subcutaneously at about 0.3-2.5 times the clinical exposure (dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day) did not show any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of tolterodine or its 5-HMT metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Based on limited data, tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice in low amounts (see Data) . The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data The use of radiolabeled tolterodine in pregnant mice produced milk: plasma ratios that ranged between 0.0 and 0.7. 8.4 Pediatric Use The effectiveness of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules has not been established in pediatric patients. Efficacy was not established in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies that enrolled 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 224 on placebo) aged 5\u201310 years with urinary frequency and urge incontinence. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients treated with tolterodine. In multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of 5-HMT were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another clinical study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than concentrations reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in the Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended. 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine and 5-HMT levels were approximately 2\u20133 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N dealkylated tolterodine, and N -dealkylated hydroxy tolterodine) were significantly higher (10\u201330 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dose for patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10-30 mL/min) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg daily. Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6) ]. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules has not been studied in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [CCr 30-80 mL/min]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study of tolterodine immediate release conducted in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh Class A and B), the elimination half- life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules can potentially result in severe central anticholinergic effects and should be treated accordingly. ECG monitoring is recommended in the event of overdosage. In dogs, changes in the QT interval (slight prolongation of 10% to 20%) were observed at a suprapharmacologic dose of 4.5 mg/kg, which is about 68 times higher than the recommended human dose. In clinical trials of normal volunteers and patients, QT interval prolongation was observed with tolterodine immediate release at doses up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) and higher doses were not evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) ] .

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5 HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of DETROL immediate release (tolterodine IR) tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18\u201355 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) ] . QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (Tmax) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QTc) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia's (QTcF) and a population-specific (QTcP) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2.

The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine's effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QTc interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with DETROL or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\"active moiety\"), the AUC of tolterodine extended-release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). Cmax and Cmin levels of tolterodine extended-release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended-release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food: There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended-release. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b11-acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5 HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (< 2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended-release and 5 HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended-release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3.

In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in Cmax and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors : The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean Cmax and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5 fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION(2.3) ] . Warfarin : In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives : Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g/levo-norgestrel 150 \u00b5g) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics : Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes : Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), exposure margins were approximately 6-9 times, 7 times, and 11 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite). At these exposure margins, no increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic or genotoxic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli, a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (about 9-12 times the clinical exposure via AUC), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg were evaluated in 29 patients in a Phase 2 dose-effect study. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg was evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence and frequency in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3, 12-week study. A total of 507 patients received tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily in the morning and 508 received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (81%), with a mean age of 61 years (range, 20 to 93 years). In the study, 642 patients (42%) were 65 to 93 years of age. The study included patients known to be responsive to tolterodine immediate release and other anticholinergic medications, however, 47% of patients never received prior pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder. At study entry, 97% of patients had at least 5 urge incontinence episodes per week and 91% of patients had 8 or more micturitions per day. The primary efficacy assessment was change in mean number of incontinence episodes per week at week 12 from baseline. Secondary efficacy measures included change in mean number of micturitions per day and mean volume voided per micturition at week 12 from baseline. Patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules experienced a statistically significant decrease in number of urinary incontinence per week from baseline to last assessment (week 12) compared with placebo as well as a decrease in the average daily urinary frequency and an increase in the average urine volume per void. Mean change from baseline in weekly incontinence episodes, urinary frequency, and volume voided between placebo and tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are summarized in Table 4.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: use caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased gastrointestinal motility because of the risk of gastric retention. ( 5.3 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: use caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.4 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules affect them ( 5.5 ) Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. ( 5.8 ) QT Prolongation: consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g., intestinal atony) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ]. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ]. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.2 ) ] including dizziness and somnolence [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.1 ) ]. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug\u2019s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.6 ) ]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min). Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.7 ) ]. 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction . 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.2 ) ], the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22654% and >placebo) were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The efficacy and safety of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules was evaluated in 1073 patients (537 assigned to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules; 536 assigned to placebo) who were treated with 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/day for up to 15 months. These included a total of 1012 patients (505 randomized to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12 week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. A serious adverse event was reported by 1.4% (n=7) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and by 3.6% (n=18) of patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists the adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study at an incidence greater than placebo and in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 4 mg once daily.

The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Similar percentages of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation among patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [n=12 (2.4%) vs. placebo n=6 (1.2%)]. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General : anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular : tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Gastrointestina l: diarrhea ; Central/Peripheral Nervous : confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

Reduce tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules dose to 2 mg once daily. ( 7.2 ) Other Anticholinergics (antimuscarinics): Concomitant use with other anticholinergic agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8 fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 ) ]. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.2 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5 fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, or ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.3 Other Interactions No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with diuretics [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.4 Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.5 Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. 7.6 Other Anticholinergics The concomitant use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, somnolence, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with CCr <10 mL/min. Dose adjustment in severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min). ( 8.6 ) Hepatic Impairment: Not recommended for use in severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C). Dose adjustment in mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A, B). ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules use in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite to pregnant mice during organogenesis did not produce adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day; however, higher doses produced adverse developmental outcomes (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No anomalies or malformations were observed after oral administration of tolterodine to pregnant mice during organogenesis at approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on the AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day). At 14 to 18 times the clinical exposure (doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day) in mice, tolterodine was embryo-lethal, caused reduced fetal weight, and increased the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification). Pregnant rabbits administered tolterodine subcutaneously at about 0.3 to 2.5 times the clinical exposure (dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day) did not show any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of tolterodine or its 5-HMT metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Based on limited data, tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice in low amounts (see Data) . The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data The use of radiolabeled tolterodine in pregnant mice produced milk: plasma ratios that ranged between 0.0 and 0.7. 8.4 Pediatric Use The effectiveness of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules has not been established in pediatric patients. Efficacy was not established in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies that enrolled 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 224 on placebo) aged 5 to 10 years with urinary frequency and urge incontinence. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients treated with tolterodine. In multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of 5-HMT were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another clinical study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than concentrations reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in the Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended. 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine and 5-HMT levels were approximately 2 to 3 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N- dealkylated tolterodine , and N -dealkylated hydroxy tolterodine) were significantly higher (10 to 30 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dose for patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 2 mg daily. Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.6 ) ]. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules have not been studied in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [CCr 30 to 80 mL/min]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study of tolterodine immediate release conducted in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh Class A and B), the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.6 ) ]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules use in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite to pregnant mice during organogenesis did not produce adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day; however, higher doses produced adverse developmental outcomes (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No anomalies or malformations were observed after oral administration of tolterodine to pregnant mice during organogenesis at approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on the AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day). At 14 to 18 times the clinical exposure (doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day) in mice, tolterodine was embryo-lethal, caused reduced fetal weight, and increased the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification). Pregnant rabbits administered tolterodine subcutaneously at about 0.3 to 2.5 times the clinical exposure (dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day) did not show any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine tartrate immediate release (tolterodine IR) tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4 way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4 day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.2 ) ]. QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QT c ) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia\u2019s (QT c F) and a population-specific (QT c P) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (CI) change in QTc from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) at Tmax (relative to placebo) Drug/Dose N QT c F QT c F QT c P QT c P (msec) (msec) (msec) (msec) (manual) (machine) (manual) (machine) Tolterodine 2 mg BID * 48 5.01 1.16 4.45 2.00 (0.28, 9.74) (-2.99, 5.30) (-0.37, 9.26) (-1.81, 5.81) Tolterodine 4 mg BID * 48 11.84 5.63 10.31 8.34 (7.11, 16.58) (1.48, 9.77) (5.49, 15.12) (4.53, 12.15) Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD \u2020 45 19.26 \u2021 8.90 19.10 \u2021 9.29 (15.49, 23.03) (4.77, 13.03) (15.32, 22.89) (5.34, 13.24) * At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval. \u2020 At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval. \u2021 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs. The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine\u2019s effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QT c interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 ) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\u201cactive moiety\u201d), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food: There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d) is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \u201cextensive metabolizers.\u201d Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3.

Drug Interactions: Potent CYP2D6 inhibitors: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.3 ) ]. Warfarin: In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives: Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg/levo-norgestrel 150 mcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes: Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine tartrate immediate release (tolterodine IR) tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4 way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4 day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.2 ) ]. QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QT c ) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia\u2019s (QT c F) and a population-specific (QT c P) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (CI) change in QTc from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) at Tmax (relative to placebo) Drug/Dose N QT c F QT c F QT c P QT c P (msec) (msec) (msec) (msec) (manual) (machine) (manual) (machine) Tolterodine 2 mg BID * 48 5.01 1.16 4.45 2.00 (0.28, 9.74) (-2.99, 5.30) (-0.37, 9.26) (-1.81, 5.81) Tolterodine 4 mg BID * 48 11.84 5.63 10.31 8.34 (7.11, 16.58) (1.48, 9.77) (5.49, 15.12) (4.53, 12.15) Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD \u2020 45 19.26 \u2021 8.90 19.10 \u2021 9.29 (15.49, 23.03) (4.77, 13.03) (15.32, 22.89) (5.34, 13.24) * At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval. \u2020 At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval. \u2021 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs. The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine\u2019s effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QT c interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 ) ]."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\u201cactive moiety\u201d), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food: There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d) is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \u201cextensive metabolizers.\u201d Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3.

Drug Interactions: Potent CYP2D6 inhibitors: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.3 ) ]. Warfarin: In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives: Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg/levo-norgestrel 150 mcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes: Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), exposure margins were approximately 6 to 9 times, 7 times, and 11 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite). At these exposure margins, no increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic or genotoxic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli, a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (about 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure via AUC), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 2 mg were evaluated in 29 patients in a Phase 2 dose-effect study. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 4 mg were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence and frequency in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3, 12-week study. A total of 507 patients received tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 4 mg once daily in the morning and 508 received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (81%), with a mean age of 61 years (range, 20 to 93 years). In the study, 642 patients (42%) were 65 to 93 years of age. The study included patients known to be responsive to tolterodine immediate release and other anticholinergic medications, however, 47% of patients never received prior pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder. At study entry, 97% of patients had at least 5 urge incontinence episodes per week and 91% of patients had 8 or more micturitions per day. The primary efficacy assessment was change in mean number of incontinence episodes per week at week 12 from baseline. Secondary efficacy measures included change in mean number of micturitions per day and mean volume voided per micturition at week 12 from baseline. Patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules experienced a statistically significant decrease in number of urinary incontinence per week from baseline to last assessment (week 12) compared with placebo as well as a decrease in the average daily urinary frequency and an increase in the average urine volume per void. Mean change from baseline in weekly incontinence episodes, urinary frequency, and volume voided between placebo and tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are summarized in Table 4.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, a major pharmacologically active metabolite. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. Tolterodine immediate release is rapidly absorbed, and maximum serum concentrations (C max ) typically occur within 1 to 2 hours after dose administration. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Effect of Food Food intake increases the bioavailability of tolterodine (average increase 53%), but does not affect the levels of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive metabolizers. This change is not expected to be a safety concern and adjustment of dose is not needed. Distribution Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N-dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism A subset (about 7%) of the population is devoid of CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite of tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d) is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \u201cextensive metabolizers.\u201d Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Excretion Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 1. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine 4 mg administered twice daily to 16 healthy male volunteers (8 EM, 8 PM). Table 1.

In another Phase 1 study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ). Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine have not been established in pediatric patients. Gender The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are not influenced by gender. Mean C max of tolterodine (1.6 \u00b5g/L in males versus 2.2 \u00b5g/L in females) and the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (2.2 \u00b5g/L in males versus 2.5 \u00b5g/L in females) are similar in males and females who were administered tolterodine immediate release 2 mg. Mean AUC values of tolterodine (6.7 \u00b5g\u00b7h/L in males versus 7.8 \u00b5g\u00b7h/L in females) and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (10 \u00b5g\u00b7h/L in males versus 11 \u00b5g\u00b7h/L in females) are also similar. The elimination half-life of tolterodine for both males and females is 2.4 hours, and the half-life of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is 3.0 hours in females and 3.3 hours in males. Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been established. Renal Insufficiency: Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite levels were approximately 2\u20133 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N-dealkylated tolterodine acid, N-dealkylated tolterodine, and N-dealkylated hydroxylated tolterodine) were significantly higher (10\u201330 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dosage for patients with significantly reduced renal function is tolterodine tartrate tablets 1 mg twice daily (see PRECAUTIONS, General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study conducted in cirrhotic patients, the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with significantly reduced hepatic function is tolterodine tartrate tablets 1 mg twice daily (see PRECAUTIONS, General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug-Drug Interactions Fluoxetine Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine tartrate tablets and fluoxetine are coadministered. Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes. CYP3A4 Inhibitors The effect of 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were poor metabolizers (see Pharmacokinetics , Variability in Metabolism for discussion of poor metabolizers). In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2 and 2.5 fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Warfarin In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g/levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel over a 2-month cycle in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine immediate release (IR) on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18\u201355 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QTc) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia\u2019s (QTcF) and a population-specific (QTcP) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (CI) change in QTc from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) at T max (relative to placebo) Drug/Dose N QTcF (msec) (manual) QTcF (msec) (machine) QTcP (msec) (manual) QTcP (msec) (machine) Tolterodine 2 mg BID At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval 48 5.01 (0.28, 9.74) 1.16 (-2.99, 5.30) 4.45 (-0.37, 9.26) 2.00 (-1.81, 5.81) Tolterodine 4 mg BID 48 11.84 (7.11, 16.58) 5.63 (1.48, 9.77) 10.31 (5.49, 15.12) 8.34 (4.53, 12.15) Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval 45 19.26 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs. (15.49, 23.03) 8.90 (4.77, 13.03) 19.10 (15.32, 22.89) 9.29 (5.34, 13.24) The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine\u2019s effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QTc interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (see PRECAUTIONS, Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation )."

      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. Tolterodine immediate release is rapidly absorbed, and maximum serum concentrations (C max ) typically occur within 1 to 2 hours after dose administration. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Effect of Food Food intake increases the bioavailability of tolterodine (average increase 53%), but does not affect the levels of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive metabolizers. This change is not expected to be a safety concern and adjustment of dose is not needed. Distribution Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N-dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism A subset (about 7%) of the population is devoid of CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite of tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d) is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \u201cextensive metabolizers.\u201d Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Excretion Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 1. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine 4 mg administered twice daily to 16 healthy male volunteers (8 EM, 8 PM). Table 1.

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tartrate tablets were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies. A total of 853 patients received tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg twice daily and 685 patients received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (78%), with a mean age of 60 years (range, 19 to 93 years). At study entry, nearly all patients perceived they had urgency and most patients had increased frequency of micturitions and urge incontinence. These characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups for the studies. The efficacy endpoints for study 007 (see Table 3) included the change from baseline for: \u2022 Number of incontinence episodes per week \u2022 Number of micturitions per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days) \u2022 Volume of urine voided per micturition (averaged over 2 days) The efficacy endpoints for studies 008, 009, and 010 (see Table 4) were identical to the above endpoints with the exception that the number of incontinence episodes was per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days).

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Risk of Urinary Retention and Gastric Retention Tolterodine tartrate tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention and to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders, such as pyloric stenosis, because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Tolterodine tartrate tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Tolterodine tartrate tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects Tolterodine tartrate tablets is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects including dizziness and somnolence (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug\u2019s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Reduced Hepatic and Renal Function For patients with significantly reduced hepatic function or renal function, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate tablets is 1 mg twice daily (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations ). Myasthenia Gravis Tolterodine tartrate tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Cardiac Electrophysiology ), the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate tablets for patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that antimuscarinic agents such as tolterodine tartrate tablets may produce the following effects: blurred vision, dizziness, or drowsiness. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until the drug's effects have been determined. Drug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, significantly increased plasma concentrations of tolterodine when coadministered to subjects who were poor metabolizers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Variability in Metabolism and Drug-Drug Interactions ). For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate tablets is 1 mg twice daily (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), AUC values obtained for tolterodine were 355, 291, and 462 \u00b5g\u00b7h/L, respectively. In comparison, the human AUC value for a 2 mg dose administered twice daily is estimated at 34 \u00b5g\u00b7h/L. Thus, tolterodine exposure in the carcinogenicity studies was 9- to 14-fold higher than expected in humans. No increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli , a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (corresponding to AUC value of about 500 \u00b5g\u00b7h/L), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. Based on AUC values, the systemic exposure was about 15-fold higher in animals than in humans. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility. Pregnancy Tolterodine, administered at oral doses of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 14 times the human exposure), showed no anomalies or malformations in mice. When given at doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day, tolterodine has been shown to be embryolethal, reduce fetal weight, and increase the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification) in mice. At these doses, the AUC values were about 20- to 25-fold higher than in humans. Rabbits treated subcutaneously at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day achieved an AUC of 100 \u00b5g\u00b7h/L, which is about 3-fold higher than that resulting from the human dose. This dose did not result in any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. There are no studies of tolterodine in pregnant women. Therefore, tolterodine tartrate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice. Offspring of female mice treated with tolterodine 20 mg/kg/day during the lactation period had slightly reduced body weight gain. The offspring regained the weight during the maturation phase. It is not known whether tolterodine is excreted in human milk; therefore, tolterodine tartrate tablets should not be administered during nursing. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue tolterodine tartrate tablets in nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Efficacy in the pediatric population has not been demonstrated. Two pediatric phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies were conducted using tolterodine extended release capsules. A total of 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 224 on placebo) aged 5\u201310 years with urinary frequency and urge urinary incontinence were studied. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. Geriatric Use Of the 1120 patients who were treated in the four Phase 3, 12-week clinical studies of tolterodine tartrate tablets, 474 (42%) were 65 to 91 years of age. No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations )."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial program for tolterodine tartrate tablets included 3071 patients who were treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets (N=2133) or placebo (N=938). The patients were treated with 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/day for up to 12 months. No differences in the safety profile of tolterodine were identified based on age, gender, race, or metabolism. The data described below reflect exposure to tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five Phase 3, controlled clinical studies. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and approximating rates. Sixty-six percent of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid reported adverse events versus 56% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate tablets were dry mouth, headache, constipation, vertigo/dizziness, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and xerophthalmia are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in the Phase 3 clinical studies, occurring in 34.8% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets and 9.8% of placebo-treated patients. One percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets discontinued treatment due to dry mouth. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Seven percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid discontinued treatment due to adverse events versus 6% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of tolterodine tartrate tablets were dizziness and headache. Three percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid reported a serious adverse event versus 4% of placebo patients. Significant ECG changes in QT and QTc have not been demonstrated in clinical-study patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid. Table 5 lists the adverse events reported in 1% or more of the patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in the 12-week studies. The adverse events are reported regardless of causality. Table 5. Incidence in nearest integer.

Tolterodine tartrate tablets is a prescription medicine for adults used to treat the following symptoms due to a condition called overactive bladder : \u2022 Urge urinary incontinence: a strong need to urinate with leaking or wetting accidents \u2022 Urgency: a strong need to urinate right away \u2022 Frequency: urinating often Tolterodine tartrate extended release capsules did not help the symptoms of overactive bladder when studied in children. What is overactive bladder? Overactive bladder happens when you cannot control your bladder muscle. When the muscle contracts too often or cannot be controlled, you get symptoms of overactive bladder, which are leakage of urine (urge urinary incontinence), needing to urinate right away (urgency), and needing to urinate often (frequency). Who should not take tolterodine tartrate tablets? Do not take tolterodine tartrate tablets if you: \u2022 Are not able to empty your bladder (urinary retention) \u2022 Have delayed or slow emptying of your stomach (gastric retention) \u2022 Have an eye problem called \u201cuncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma\u201d \u2022 Are allergic to tolterodine tartrate tablets or to any of its ingredients. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients \u2022 Are allergic to TOVIAZ which contains fesoterodine. What should I tell my doctor before starting tolterodine tartrate tablets?

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, a major pharmacologically active metabolite. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate-release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. Tolterodine immediate-release is rapidly absorbed, and maximum serum concentrations (C max ) typically occur within 1 to 2 hours after dose administration. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate-release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Effect of Food Food intake increases the bioavailability of tolterodine (average increase 53%), but does not affect the levels of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive metabolizers. This change is not expected to be a safety concern and adjustment of dose is not needed. Distribution Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism A subset (about 7%) of the population is devoid of CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite of tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Excretion Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (< 2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (< 1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine immediate-release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 1 . These data were obtained following single- and multiple-doses of tolterodine 4 mg administered twice daily to 16 healthy male volunteers (8 EM, 8 PM).

Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age In Phase 1, multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate-release 4 mg (2 mg BID) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another Phase 1 study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate-release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg BID). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in Phase 3, 12 week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use ). Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine have not been established in pediatric patients. Gender The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate-release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are not influenced by gender. Mean C max of tolterodine (1.6 mcg/L in males versus 2.2 mcg/L in females) and the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (2.2 mcg/L in males versus 2.5 mcg/L in females) are similar in males and females who were administered tolterodine immediate-release 2 mg. Mean AUC values of tolterodine (6.7 mcg\u2022h/L in males versus 7.8 mcg\u2022h/L in females) and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (10 mcg\u2022h/L in males versus 11 mcg\u2022h/L in females) are also similar. The elimination half-life of tolterodine for both males and females is 2.4 hours, and the half-life of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is 3 hours in females and 3.3 hours in males. Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been established. Renal Insufficiency Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate-release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine immediate-release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite levels were approximately 2 to 3 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine, and N -dealkylated hydroxylated tolterodine) were significantly higher (10 to 30 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dosage for patients with significantly reduced renal function is tolterodine 1 mg twice daily (see PRECAUTIONS , General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate-release. In a study conducted in cirrhotic patients, the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate-release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with significantly reduced hepatic function is tolterodine 1 mg twice daily (see PRECAUTIONS , General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug-Drug Interactions Fluoxetine Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate-release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate-release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8 fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate-release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate-release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are coadministered. Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Tolterodine immediate-release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug interaction data show that tolterodine immediate-release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate-release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate-release as well as the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes. CYP3A4 Inhibitors The effect of 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate-release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were poor metabolizers (see Pharmacokinetics , Variability in Metabolism for discussion of poor metabolizers). In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2 and 2.5 fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Warfarin In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate-release 4 mg (2 mg BID) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives Tolterodine immediate-release 4 mg (2 mg BID) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg/levonorgestrel 150 mcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel over a 2 month cycle in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics Coadministration of tolterodine immediate-release up to 8 mg (4 mg BID) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine immediate-release (IR) on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4 way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N = 25) and female (N = 23) volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4 day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ). QT interval was measured over a 12 hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QTc) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia\u2019s (QTcF) and a population-specific (QTcP) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute Table 2: Mean (CI) Change in QTc From Baseline to Steady State (Day 4 of Dosing) at T max (Relative to Placebo) Drug/Dose N QTcF (msec) (manual) QTcF (msec) (machine) QTcP (msec) (manual) QTcP (msec) (machine) Tolterodine 2 mg BID At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval 48 5.01 (0.28, 9.74) 1.16 (-2.99, 5.30) 4.45 (-0.37, 9.26) 2 (-1.81, 5.81) Tolterodine 4 mg BID 48 11.84 (7.11, 16.58) 5.63 (1.48, 9.77) 10.31 (5.49, 15.12) 8.34 (4.53, 12.15) Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval 45 19.26 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs. (15.49, 23.03) 8.90 (4.77, 13.03) 19.10 (15.32, 22.89) 9.29 (5.34, 13.24) The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate-release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine\u2019s effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QTc interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de pointes in the international postmarketing experience with tolterodine tablets or tolterodine extended-release capsules (see PRECAUTIONS , Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation )."

      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. Tolterodine immediate-release is rapidly absorbed, and maximum serum concentrations (C max ) typically occur within 1 to 2 hours after dose administration. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate-release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Effect of Food Food intake increases the bioavailability of tolterodine (average increase 53%), but does not affect the levels of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive metabolizers. This change is not expected to be a safety concern and adjustment of dose is not needed. Distribution Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism A subset (about 7%) of the population is devoid of CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite of tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Excretion Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (< 2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (< 1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine immediate-release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 1 . These data were obtained following single- and multiple-doses of tolterodine 4 mg administered twice daily to 16 healthy male volunteers (8 EM, 8 PM).

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tablets were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12 week studies. A total of 853 patients received tolterodine 2 mg twice daily and 685 patients received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (78%), with a mean age of 60 years (range, 19 to 93 years). At study entry, nearly all patients perceived they had urgency and most patients had increased frequency of micturitions and urge incontinence. These characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups for the studies. The efficacy endpoints for study 007 (see Table 3 ) included the change from baseline for: \u2022 Number of incontinence episodes per week \u2022 Number of micturitions per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days) \u2022 Volume of urine voided per micturition (averaged over 2 days) The efficacy endpoints for studies 008, 009, and 010 (see Table 4 ) were identical to the above endpoints with the exception that the number of incontinence episodes was per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days).

In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Risk of Urinary Retention and Gastric Retention Tolterodine tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention and to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders, such as pyloric stenosis, because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Tolterodine, like other antimuscarinic drugs, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Tolterodine should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects Tolterodine tablets are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects including dizziness and somnolence (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug\u2019s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Reduced Hepatic and Renal Function For patients with significantly reduced hepatic function or renal function, the recommended dose of tolterodine is 1 mg twice daily (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations ). Myasthenia Gravis Tolterodine should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. Patients With Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate-release tablets on the QT interval (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Cardiac Electrophysiology ), the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine for patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ). There has been no association of Torsade de pointes in the international postmarketing experience with tolterodine tablets or tolterodine extended-release capsules. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that antimuscarinic agents such as tolterodine may produce the following effects: blurred vision, dizziness, or drowsiness. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until the drug's effects have been determined. Drug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, significantly increased plasma concentrations of tolterodine when coadministered to subjects who were poor metabolizers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Variability in Metabolism and Drug-Drug Interactions ). For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine, the recommended dose of tolterodine is 1 mg twice daily (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), AUC values obtained for tolterodine were 355, 291, and 462 mcg\u2022h/L, respectively. In comparison, the human AUC value for a 2 mg dose administered twice daily is estimated at 34 mcg\u2022h/L. Thus, tolterodine exposure in the carcinogenicity studies was 9 to 14 fold higher than expected in humans. No increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli , a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (corresponding to AUC value of about 500 mcg\u2022h/L), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. Based on AUC values, the systemic exposure was about 15 fold higher in animals than in humans. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C At oral doses of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 14 times the human exposure), no anomalies or malformations were observed in mice. When given at doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day, tolterodine has been shown to be embryolethal, reduce fetal weight, and increase the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification) in mice. At these doses, the AUC values were about 20 to 25 fold higher than in humans. Rabbits treated subcutaneously at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day achieved an AUC of 100 mcg\u2022h/L, which is about 3 fold higher than that resulting from the human dose. This dose did not result in any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. There are no studies of tolterodine in pregnant women. Therefore, tolterodine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice. Offspring of female mice treated with tolterodine 20 mg/kg/day during the lactation period had slightly reduced body weight gain. The offspring regained the weight during the maturation phase. It is not known whether tolterodine is excreted in human milk; therefore, tolterodine should not be administered during nursing. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue tolterodine in nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Efficacy in the pediatric population has not been demonstrated. Two pediatric phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12 week studies were conducted using tolterodine extended-release capsules. A total of 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine extended-release capsules and 224 on placebo) aged 5 to 10 years with urinary frequency and urge urinary incontinence were studied. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. Geriatric Use Of the 1120 patients who were treated in the four Phase 3, 12 week clinical studies of tolterodine, 474 (42%) were 65 to 91 years of age. No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations )."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Risk of Urinary Retention and Gastric Retention Tolterodine tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention and to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders, such as pyloric stenosis, because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Tolterodine, like other antimuscarinic drugs, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Tolterodine should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects Tolterodine tablets are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects including dizziness and somnolence (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug\u2019s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Reduced Hepatic and Renal Function For patients with significantly reduced hepatic function or renal function, the recommended dose of tolterodine is 1 mg twice daily (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations ). Myasthenia Gravis Tolterodine should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), AUC values obtained for tolterodine were 355, 291, and 462 mcg\u2022h/L, respectively. In comparison, the human AUC value for a 2 mg dose administered twice daily is estimated at 34 mcg\u2022h/L. Thus, tolterodine exposure in the carcinogenicity studies was 9 to 14 fold higher than expected in humans. No increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli , a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (corresponding to AUC value of about 500 mcg\u2022h/L), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. Based on AUC values, the systemic exposure was about 15 fold higher in animals than in humans. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility."

At these doses, the AUC values were about 20 to 25 fold higher than in humans. Rabbits treated subcutaneously at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day achieved an AUC of 100 mcg\u2022h/L, which is about 3 fold higher than that resulting from the human dose.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial program for tolterodine tablets included 3071 patients who were treated with tolterodine (N = 2133) or placebo (N = 938). The patients were treated with 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/day for up to 12 months. No differences in the safety profile of tolterodine were identified based on age, gender, race, or metabolism. The data described below reflect exposure to tolterodine 2 mg BID in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five Phase 3, controlled clinical studies. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and approximating rates. Sixty-six percent of patients receiving tolterodine 2 mg BID reported adverse events versus 56% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine were dry mouth, headache, constipation, vertigo/dizziness, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and xerophthalmia are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg BID in the Phase 3 clinical studies, occurring in 34.8% of patients treated with tolterodine and 9.8% of placebo-treated patients. One percent of patients treated with tolterodine discontinued treatment due to dry mouth. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Seven percent of patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg BID discontinued treatment due to adverse events versus 6% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of tolterodine were dizziness and headache. Three percent of patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg BID reported a serious adverse event versus 4% of placebo patients. Significant ECG changes in QT and QTc have not been demonstrated in clinical-study patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg BID. Table 5 lists the adverse events reported in 1% or more of the patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg BID in the 12 week studies. The adverse events are reported regardless of causality.

Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide postmarketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, a major pharmacologically active metabolite. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. Tolterodine immediate release is rapidly absorbed, and maximum serum concentrations (C max ) typically occur within 1 to 2 hours after dose administration. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Effect of Food Food intake increases the bioavailability of tolterodine (average increase 53%), but does not affect the levels of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive metabolizers. This change is not expected to be a safety concern and adjustment of dose is not needed. Distribution Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b11-acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N-dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism A subset (about 7%) of the population is devoid of CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite of tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N-dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Excretion Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 1. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine 4 mg administered twice daily to 16 healthy male volunteers (8 EM, 8 PM). Table 1. Summary of Mean (\u00b1SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Tolterodine and its Active Metabolite (5-hydroxymethyl metabolite) in Healthy Volunteers C max = Maximum plasma concentration; t max = Time of occurrence of C max ; C avg = Average plasma concentration; t 1/2 = Terminal elimination half-life; CL/F = Apparent oral clearance. EM = Extensive metabolizers; PM = Poor metabolizers. * Parameter was dose-normalized from 4 mg to 2 mg. \u2020 = not applicable. tolterodine-fig1 Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age In Phase 1, multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another Phase 1 study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ). Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine have not been established in pediatric patients. Gender The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are not influenced by gender. Mean C max of tolterodine (1.6 \u03bcg/L in males versus 2.2 \u03bcg/L in females) and the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (2.2 \u03bcg/L in males versus 2.5 \u03bcg/L in females) are similar in males and females who were administered tolterodine immediate release 2 mg. Mean AUC values of tolterodine (6.7 \u03bcg\u00b7h/L in males versus 7.8 \u03bcg\u00b7h/L in females) and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (10 \u03bcg\u00b7h/L in males versus 11 \u03bcg\u00b7h/L in females) are also similar. The elimination half-life of tolterodine for both males and females is 2.4 hours, and the half-life of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is 3.0 hours in females and 3.3 hours in males. Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been established. Renal Insufficiency Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite levels were approximately 2\u20133 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine, and N -dealkylated hydroxylated tolterodine) were significantly higher (10\u201330 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dosage for patients with significantly reduced renal function is tolterodine tartrate tablets 1 mg twice daily (see PRECAUTIONS, General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study conducted in cirrhotic patients, the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with significantly reduced hepatic function is tolterodine tartrate tablets 1 mg twice daily (see PRECAUTIONS, General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug-Drug Interactions Fluoxetine Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine tartrate tablets and fluoxetine are coadministered. Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes. CYP3A4 Inhibitors The effect of 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were poor metabolizers (see Pharmacokinetics, Variability in Metabolism for discussion of poor metabolizers). In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2 and 2.5 fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Warfarin In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g/levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel over a 2 month cycle in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine immediate release (IR) on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18\u201355 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QTc) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia's (QTcF) and a population-specific (QTcP) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2.

The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine's effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QTc interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (see PRECAUTIONS, Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation ). CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tartrate tablets were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies. A total of 853 patients received Tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg twice daily and 685 patients received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (78%), with a mean age of 60 years (range, 19 to 93 years). At study entry, nearly all patients perceived they had urgency and most patients had increased frequency of micturitions and urge incontinence. These characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups for the studies. The efficacy endpoints for study 007 (see Table 3) included the change from baseline for: Number of incontinence episodes per week Number of micturitions per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days) Volume of urine voided per micturition (averaged over 2 days) The efficacy endpoints for studies 008, 009, and 010 (see Table 4) were identical to the above endpoints with the exception that the number of incontinence episodes was per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days).

In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Risk of Urinary Retention and Gastric Retention Tolterodine tartrate tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention and to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders, such as pyloric stenosis, because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Tolterodine tartrate tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Tolterodine tartrate tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects Tolterodine tartrate tablets are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects including dizziness and somnolence (see Adverse Reactions ). Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug's effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Reduced Hepatic and Renal Function For patients with significantly reduced hepatic function or renal function, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate tablets 1 mg twice daily (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations ). Myasthenia Gravis: Tolterodine tartrate tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Cardiac Electrophysiology ) , the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate tablets for patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ) .There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that antimuscarinic agents such as tolterodine tartrate tablets may produce the following effects: blurred vision, dizziness, or drowsiness. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until the drug's effects have been determined. Drug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, significantly increased plasma concentrations of tolterodine when coadministered to subjects who were poor metabolizers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Variability in Metabolism and Drug-Drug Interactions ). For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate tablets is 1 mg twice daily (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), AUC values obtained for tolterodine were 355, 291, and 462 \u00b5g\u2219h/L, respectively. In comparison, the human AUC value for a 2 mg dose administered twice daily is estimated at 34 \u00b5g\u2219h/L. Thus, tolterodine exposure in the carcinogenicity studies was 9- to 14-fold higher than expected in humans. No increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli , a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (corresponding to AUC value of about 500 \u00b5g\u2219h/L), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. Based on AUC values, the systemic exposure was about 15-fold higher in animals than in humans. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. At oral doses of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 14 times the human exposure), no anomalies or malformations were observed in mice. When given at doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day, tolterodine has been shown to be embryolethal, reduce fetal weight, and increase the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification) in mice. At these doses, the AUC values were about 20- to 25-fold higher than in humans. Rabbits treated subcutaneously at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day achieved an AUC of 100 \u03bcg\u00b7h/L, which is about 3-fold higher than that resulting from the human dose. This dose did not result in any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. There are no studies of tolterodine in pregnant women. Therefore, tolterodine tartrate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice. Offspring of female mice treated with tolterodine 20 mg/kg/day during the lactation period had slightly reduced body weight gain. The offspring regained the weight during the maturation phase. It is not known whether tolterodine is excreted in human milk; therefore, tolterodine tartrate tablets should not be administered during nursing. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue tolterodine tartrate tablets in nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Efficacy in the pediatric population has not been demonstrated. Two pediatric phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies were conducted using tolterodine extended-release capsules. A total of 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 224 on placebo) aged 5\u201310 years with urinary frequency and urge urinary incontinence were studied. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. Geriatric Use Of the 1120 patients who were treated in the four Phase 3, 12-week clinical studies of tolterodine tartrate tablets 474 (42%) were 65 to 91 years of age. No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations )."

The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial program for tolterodine tartrate tablets included 3071 patients who were treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets (N=2133) or placebo (N=938). The patients were treated with 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/day for up to 12 months. No differences in the safety profile of tolterodine were identified based on age, gender, race, or metabolism. The data described below reflect exposure to tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five Phase 3, controlled clinical studies. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and approximating rates. Sixty-six percent of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid reported adverse events versus 56% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate tablets were dry mouth, headache, constipation, vertigo/dizziness, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and xerophthalmia are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in the Phase 3 clinical studies, occurring in 34.8% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets and 9.8% of placebo-treated patients. One percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets discontinued treatment due to dry mouth. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Seven percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid discontinued treatment due to adverse events versus 6% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of tolterodine tartrate tablets were dizziness and headache. Three percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid reported a serious adverse event versus 4% of placebo patients. Significant ECG changes in QT and QTc have not been demonstrated in clinical-study patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid. Table 5 lists the adverse events reported in 1% or more of the patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in the 12-week studies. The adverse events are reported regardless of causality. Table 5.

Post-marketing Surveillance The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General: anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular: tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Central/Peripheral Nervous: confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: use caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased gastrointestinal motility because of the risk of gastric retention. ( 5.3 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: use caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.4 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules affect them ( 5.5 ). Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. ( 5.8 ) QT Prolongation: consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g., intestinal atony) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ] . 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ] . 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2) ] including dizziness and somnolence [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) ] . Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug\u2019s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6) ]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min). Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7) ] . 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) ] , the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22654% and >placebo) were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Slate Run Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-888-341-9214 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The efficacy and safety of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules was evaluated in 1,073 patients (537 assigned to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules; 536 assigned to placebo) who were treated with 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/day for up to 15 months. These included a total of 1,012 patients (505 randomized to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. A serious adverse event was reported by 1.4% (n=7) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and by 3.6% (n=18) of patients receiving placebo.

Similar percentages of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation among patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [n=12 (2.4%) vs. placebo n=6 (1.2%)]. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General: anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular: tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Gastrointestinal: diarrhea; Central/Per ip heral Nervous: confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

( 7.6 ) 7.1 Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.1) ] . The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.2 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, or ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ] . 7.3 Other Interactions No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with diuretics [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.4 Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.5 Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. 7.6 Other Anticholinergics The concomitant use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, somnolence, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects."

Dose adjustment in severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min). ( 8.6 ) Hepatic Impairment: Not recommended for use in severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C). Dose adjustment in mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A, B). ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules use in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite to pregnant mice during organogenesis did not produce adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day; however, higher doses produced adverse developmental outcomes (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No anomalies or malformations were observed after oral administration of tolterodine to pregnant mice during organogenesis at approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on the AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day). At 14 to 18 times the clinical exposure (doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day) in mice, tolterodine was embryo-lethal, caused reduced fetal weight, and increased the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification). Pregnant rabbits administered tolterodine subcutaneously at about 0.3 to 2.5 times the clinical exposure (dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day) did not show any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of tolterodine or its 5-HMT metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Based on limited data, tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice in low amounts (see Data ) . The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data The use of radiolabeled tolterodine in pregnant mice produced milk: plasma ratios that ranged between 0.0 and 0.7. 8.4 Pediatric Use The effectiveness of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules has not been established in pediatric patients. Efficacy was not established in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies that enrolled 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 224 on placebo) aged 5 to 10 years with urinary frequency and urge incontinence. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients treated with tolterodine. In multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of 5-HMT were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another clinical study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than concentrations reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in the Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended. 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine and 5-HMT levels were approximately 2 to 3 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine, and N -dealkylated hydroxy tolterodine) were significantly higher (10 to 30 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dose for patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg daily. Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6) ]. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules have not been studied in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [CCr 30 to 80 mL/min]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study of tolterodine immediate release conducted in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh Class A and B), the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0\u00b11.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7\u00b13.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine tartrate immediate release tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) ] . QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QT c ) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia's (QT c F) and a population-specific (QT c P) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (CI) change in QT c from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) at T max (relative to placebo) Drug/Dose N QT c F (msec) (manual) QT c F (msec) (machine) QT c P (msec) (manual) QT c P (msec) (machine) Tolterodine 2 mg BID * 48 5.01 (0.28, 9.74) 1.16 (-2.99, 5.30) 4.45 (-0.37, 9.26) 2.00 (-1.81, 5.81) Tolterodine 4 mg BID * 48 11.84 (7.11, 16.58) 5.63 (1.48, 9.77) 10.31 (5.49, 15.12) 8.34 (4.53, 12.15) Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD \u2020 45 19.26 \u2021 (15.49, 23.03) 8.90 (4.77, 13.03) 19.10 \u2021 (15.32, 22.89) 9.29 (5.34, 13.24) * At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval. \u2020 At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval. \u2021 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs. The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine's effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QT c interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\u201cactive moiety\u201d), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7%\u00b10.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36%\u00b14.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113\u00b126.7 L. Metabolism Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51%\u00b114% and 29%\u00b16.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d) is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \u201cextensive metabolizers.\u201d Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5\u00ad-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3.

Drug Interactions Potent CYP2D6 inhibitors Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) ] . Warfarin In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g/levo-norgestrel 150 \u00b5g) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (K i 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine tartrate immediate release tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) ] . QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QT c ) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia's (QT c F) and a population-specific (QT c P) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (CI) change in QT c from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) at T max (relative to placebo) Drug/Dose N QT c F (msec) (manual) QT c F (msec) (machine) QT c P (msec) (manual) QT c P (msec) (machine) Tolterodine 2 mg BID * 48 5.01 (0.28, 9.74) 1.16 (-2.99, 5.30) 4.45 (-0.37, 9.26) 2.00 (-1.81, 5.81) Tolterodine 4 mg BID * 48 11.84 (7.11, 16.58) 5.63 (1.48, 9.77) 10.31 (5.49, 15.12) 8.34 (4.53, 12.15) Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD \u2020 45 19.26 \u2021 (15.49, 23.03) 8.90 (4.77, 13.03) 19.10 \u2021 (15.32, 22.89) 9.29 (5.34, 13.24) * At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval. \u2020 At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval. \u2021 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs. The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine's effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QT c interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7) ] ."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\u201cactive moiety\u201d), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7%\u00b10.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36%\u00b14.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113\u00b126.7 L. Metabolism Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51%\u00b114% and 29%\u00b16.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d) is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \u201cextensive metabolizers.\u201d Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5\u00ad-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3.

Drug Interactions Potent CYP2D6 inhibitors Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) ] . Warfarin In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g/levo-norgestrel 150 \u00b5g) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (K i 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), exposure margins were approximately 6 to 9 times, 7 times, and 11 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite). At these exposure margins, no increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic or genotoxic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli, a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (about 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure via AUC), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg were evaluated in 29 patients in a Phase 2 dose-effect study. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence and frequency in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3, 12-week study. A total of 507 patients received tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily in the morning and 508 received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (81%), with a mean age of 61 years (range, 20 to 93 years). In the study, 642 patients (42%) were 65 to 93 years of age. The study included patients known to be responsive to tolterodine immediate release and other anticholinergic medications, however, 47% of patients never received prior pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder. At study entry, 97% of patients had at least 5 urge incontinence episodes per week and 91% of patients had 8 or more micturitions per day. The primary efficacy assessment was change in mean number of incontinence episodes per week at week 12 from baseline. Secondary efficacy measures included change in mean number of micturitions per day and mean volume voided per micturition at week 12 from baseline. Patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules experienced a statistically significant decrease in number of urinary incontinence per week from baseline to last assessment (week 12) compared with placebo as well as a decrease in the average daily urinary frequency and an increase in the average urine volume per void. Mean change from baseline in weekly incontinence episodes, urinary frequency, and volume voided between placebo and tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are summarized in Table 4.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, a major pharmacologically active metabolite. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate-release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. Tolterodine immediate-release is rapidly absorbed, and maximum serum concentrations (C max ) typically occur within 1 to 2 hours after dose administration. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate-release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Effect of Food Food intake increases the bioavailability of tolterodine (average increase 53%), but does not affect the levels of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive metabolizers. This change is not expected to be a safety concern and adjustment of dose is not needed. Distribution Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism A subset (about 7%) of the population is devoid of CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite of tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Excretion Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (< 2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (< 1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine immediate-release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 1 . These data were obtained following single- and multiple-doses of tolterodine 4 mg administered twice daily to 16 healthy male volunteers (8 EM, 8 PM).

Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age In Phase 1, multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate-release 4 mg (2 mg BID) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another Phase 1 study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate-release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg BID). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in Phase 3, 12 week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use ). Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine have not been established in pediatric patients. Gender The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate-release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are not influenced by gender. Mean C max of tolterodine (1.6 mcg/L in males versus 2.2 mcg/L in females) and the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (2.2 mcg/L in males versus 2.5 mcg/L in females) are similar in males and females who were administered tolterodine immediate-release 2 mg. Mean AUC values of tolterodine (6.7 mcg\u2022h/L in males versus 7.8 mcg\u2022h/L in females) and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (10 mcg\u2022h/L in males versus 11 mcg\u2022h/L in females) are also similar. The elimination half-life of tolterodine for both males and females is 2.4 hours, and the half-life of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is 3 hours in females and 3.3 hours in males. Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been established. Renal Insufficiency Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate-release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine immediate-release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite levels were approximately 2 to 3 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine, and N -dealkylated hydroxylated tolterodine) were significantly higher (10 to 30 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dosage for patients with significantly reduced renal function is tolterodine 1 mg twice daily (see PRECAUTIONS , General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate-release. In a study conducted in cirrhotic patients, the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate-release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with significantly reduced hepatic function is tolterodine 1 mg twice daily (see PRECAUTIONS , General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug-Drug Interactions Fluoxetine Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate-release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate-release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8 fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate-release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate-release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are coadministered. Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Tolterodine immediate-release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug interaction data show that tolterodine immediate-release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate-release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate-release as well as the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes. CYP3A4 Inhibitors The effect of 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate-release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were poor metabolizers (see Pharmacokinetics , Variability in Metabolism for discussion of poor metabolizers). In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2 and 2.5 fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Warfarin In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate-release 4 mg (2 mg BID) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives Tolterodine immediate-release 4 mg (2 mg BID) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg/levonorgestrel 150 mcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel over a 2 month cycle in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics Coadministration of tolterodine immediate-release up to 8 mg (4 mg BID) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine immediate-release (IR) on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4 way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N = 25) and female (N = 23) volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4 day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ). QT interval was measured over a 12 hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QTc) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia\u2019s (QTcF) and a population-specific (QTcP) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute Table 2: Mean (CI) Change in QTc From Baseline to Steady State (Day 4 of Dosing) at Tmax (Relative to Placebo) Drug/Dose N QTcF (msec) (manual) QTcF (msec) (machine) QTcP (msec) (manual) QTcP (msec) (machine) Tolterodine 2 mg BID1 48 5.01 (0.28, 9.74) 1.16 (-2.99, 5.30) 4.45 (-0.37, 9.26) 2 (-1.81, 5.81) Tolterodine 4 mg BID1 48 11.84 (7.11, 16.58) 5.63 (1.48, 9.77) 10.31 (5.49, 15.12) 8.34 (4.53, 12.15) Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD2 45 19.263 (15.49, 23.03) 8.90 (4.77, 13.03) 19.103 (15.32, 22.89) 9.29 (5.34, 13.24) 1. At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval 2. At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval 3. The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs. The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate-release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine\u2019s effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QTc interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de pointes in the international postmarketing experience with tolterodine tablets or tolterodine extended-release capsules (see PRECAUTIONS , Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation )."

      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. Tolterodine immediate-release is rapidly absorbed, and maximum serum concentrations (C max ) typically occur within 1 to 2 hours after dose administration. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate-release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Effect of Food Food intake increases the bioavailability of tolterodine (average increase 53%), but does not affect the levels of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive metabolizers. This change is not expected to be a safety concern and adjustment of dose is not needed. Distribution Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism A subset (about 7%) of the population is devoid of CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite of tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Excretion Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (< 2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (< 1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine immediate-release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 1 . These data were obtained following single- and multiple-doses of tolterodine 4 mg administered twice daily to 16 healthy male volunteers (8 EM, 8 PM).

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tablets were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12 week studies. A total of 853 patients received tolterodine 2 mg twice daily and 685 patients received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (78%), with a mean age of 60 years (range, 19 to 93 years). At study entry, nearly all patients perceived they had urgency and most patients had increased frequency of micturitions and urge incontinence. These characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups for the studies. The efficacy endpoints for study 007 (see Table 3 ) included the change from baseline for: Number of incontinence episodes per week Number of micturitions per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days) Volume of urine voided per micturition (averaged over 2 days) The efficacy endpoints for studies 008, 009, and 010 (see Table 4 ) were identical to the above endpoints with the exception that the number of incontinence episodes was per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days).

    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Tolterodine tablets are contraindicated in patients with urinary retention, gastric retention, or uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma. Tolterodine tablets are also contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients, or to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets which, like tolterodine tablets, are metabolized to 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tablets. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Risk of Urinary Retention and Gastric Retention Tolterodine tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention and to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders, such as pyloric stenosis, because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Tolterodine, like other antimuscarinic drugs, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Tolterodine should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects Tolterodine tablets are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects including dizziness and somnolence (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug\u2019s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Reduced Hepatic and Renal Function For patients with significantly reduced hepatic function or renal function, the recommended dose of tolterodine is 1 mg twice daily (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations ). Myasthenia Gravis Tolterodine should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. Patients With Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate-release tablets on the QT interval (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Cardiac Electrophysiology ), the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine for patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ). There has been no association of Torsade de pointes in the international postmarketing experience with tolterodine tablets or tolterodine extended-release capsules. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that antimuscarinic agents such as tolterodine may produce the following effects: blurred vision, dizziness, or drowsiness. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until the drug's effects have been determined. Drug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, significantly increased plasma concentrations of tolterodine when coadministered to subjects who were poor metabolizers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Variability in Metabolism and Drug-Drug Interactions ). For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine, the recommended dose of tolterodine is 1 mg twice daily (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), AUC values obtained for tolterodine were 355, 291, and 462 mcg\u2022h/L, respectively. In comparison, the human AUC value for a 2 mg dose administered twice daily is estimated at 34 mcg\u2022h/L. Thus, tolterodine exposure in the carcinogenicity studies was 9 to 14 fold higher than expected in humans. No increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli , a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (corresponding to AUC value of about 500 mcg\u2022h/L), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. Based on AUC values, the systemic exposure was about 15 fold higher in animals than in humans. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C At oral doses of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 14 times the human exposure), no anomalies or malformations were observed in mice. When given at doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day, tolterodine has been shown to be embryolethal, reduce fetal weight, and increase the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification) in mice. At these doses, the AUC values were about 20 to 25 fold higher than in humans. Rabbits treated subcutaneously at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day achieved an AUC of 100 mcg\u2022h/L, which is about 3 fold higher than that resulting from the human dose. This dose did not result in any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. There are no studies of tolterodine in pregnant women. Therefore, tolterodine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice. Offspring of female mice treated with tolterodine 20 mg/kg/day during the lactation period had slightly reduced body weight gain. The offspring regained the weight during the maturation phase. It is not known whether tolterodine is excreted in human milk; therefore, tolterodine should not be administered during nursing. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue tolterodine in nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Efficacy in the pediatric population has not been demonstrated. Two pediatric phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12 week studies were conducted using tolterodine extended-release capsules. A total of 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine extended-release capsules and 224 on placebo) aged 5 to 10 years with urinary frequency and urge urinary incontinence were studied. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. Geriatric Use Of the 1120 patients who were treated in the four Phase 3, 12 week clinical studies of tolterodine, 474 (42%) were 65 to 91 years of age. No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations )."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial program for tolterodine tablets included 3071 patients who were treated with tolterodine (N = 2133) or placebo (N = 938). The patients were treated with 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/day for up to 12 months. No differences in the safety profile of tolterodine were identified based on age, gender, race, or metabolism. The data described below reflect exposure to tolterodine 2 mg BID in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five Phase 3, controlled clinical studies. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and approximating rates. Sixty-six percent of patients receiving tolterodine 2 mg BID reported adverse events versus 56% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine were dry mouth, headache, constipation, vertigo/dizziness, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and xerophthalmia are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg BID in the Phase 3 clinical studies, occurring in 34.8% of patients treated with tolterodine and 9.8% of placebo-treated patients. One percent of patients treated with tolterodine discontinued treatment due to dry mouth. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Seven percent of patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg BID discontinued treatment due to adverse events versus 6% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of tolterodine were dizziness and headache. Three percent of patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg BID reported a serious adverse event versus 4% of placebo patients. Significant ECG changes in QT and QTc have not been demonstrated in clinical-study patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg BID. Table 5 lists the adverse events reported in 1% or more of the patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg BID in the 12 week studies. The adverse events are reported regardless of causality.

Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide postmarketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

      "OVERDOSAGE A 27 month-old child who ingested 5 to 7 tolterodine tablets 2 mg was treated with a suspension of activated charcoal and was hospitalized overnight with symptoms of dry mouth. The child fully recovered. Management of Overdosage Overdosage with tolterodine can potentially result in severe central anticholinergic effects and should be treated accordingly. ECG monitoring is recommended in the event of overdosage. In dogs, changes in the QT interval (slight prolongation of 10% to 20%) were observed at a suprapharmacologic dose of 4.5 mg/kg, which is about 68 times higher than the recommended human dose. In clinical trials of normal volunteers and patients, QT interval prolongation was observed with tolterodine immediate-release at doses up to 8 mg (4 mg BID) and higher doses were not evaluated (see PRECAUTIONS , Patients With Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation )."

In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g., intestinal atony) [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ]. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ]. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] including dizziness and somnolence [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug's effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.6 ) ] . 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min). Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.7 ) ]. 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.2 ) ], the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate immediate release tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22654% and >placebo) were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Torrent Pharma Inc. at 1-800-912-9561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The efficacy and safety of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules was evaluated in 1,073 patients (537 assigned to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules; 536 assigned to placebo) who were treated with 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/day for up to 15 months. These included a total of 1,012 patients (505 randomized to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. A serious adverse event was reported by 1.4% (n=7) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and by 3.6% (n=18) of patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists the adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study at an incidence greater than placebo and in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily.

Similar percentages of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation among patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [n=12 (2.4%) vs. placebo n=6 (1.2%)]. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General: anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular: tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Gastrointestinal: diarrhea ; Central/Peripheral Nervous: confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

( 7.2 ) \u2022 Other Anticholinergics (antimuscarinics): Concomitant use with other anticholinergic agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects. (7.6 ) 7.1 Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 ) ]. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ] . 7.2 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, or ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3) ]. 7.3 Other Interactions No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with diuretics [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) ] . 7.4 Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) ] . 7.5 Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. 7.6 Other Anticholinergics The concomitant use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, somnolence, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment: Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with CCr <10 mL/min. Dose adjustment in severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min). ( 8.6 ) \u2022 Hepatic Impairment: Not recommended for use in severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C). Dose adjustment in mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A, B). ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules use in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite to pregnant mice during organogenesis did not produce adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day; however, higher doses produced adverse developmental outcomes (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No anomalies or malformations were observed after oral administration of tolterodine to pregnant mice during organogenesis at approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on the AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day). At 14 to 18 times the clinical exposure (doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day) in mice, tolterodine was embryo-lethal, caused reduced fetal weight, and increased the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification). Pregnant rabbits administered tolterodine subcutaneously at about 0.3 to 2.5 times the clinical exposure (dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day) did not show any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of tolterodine or its 5-HMT metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Based on limited data, tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice in low amounts (see Data) . The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data The use of radiolabeled tolterodine in pregnant mice produced milk: plasma ratios that ranged between 0.0 and 0.7. 8.4 Pediatric Use The effectiveness of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules has not been established in pediatric patients. Efficacy was not established in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies that enrolled 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 224 on placebo) aged 5 to 10 years with urinary frequency and urge incontinence. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients treated with tolterodine. In multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of 5-HMT were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another clinical study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than concentrations reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in the Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended. 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine and 5-HMT levels were approximately 2 to 3 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N- dealkylated tolterodine, and N -dealkylated hydroxy tolterodine) were significantly higher (10 to 30 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dose for patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg daily. Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.6 ) ] . Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules have not been studied in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [CCr 30 to 80 mL/min]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study of tolterodine immediate release conducted in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh Class A and B), the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.4 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine tartrate immediate release (tolterodine IR) tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.2 )]. QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QTc) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia's (QTcF) and a population-specific (QTcP) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2.

The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine's effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QTc interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate immediate-release tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\"active moiety\"), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food: There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%.The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3.

Drug Interactions: Potent CYP2D6 inhibitors : Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors : The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) ]. Warfarin : In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives : Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg/levo-norgestrel 150 mcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes: Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (K i 1.05 \u03bcM), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), exposure margins were approximately 6 to 9 times, 7 times, and 11 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite). At these exposure margins, no increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic or genotoxic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli, a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (about 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure via AUC), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg were evaluated in 29 patients in a Phase 2 dose-effect study. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence and frequency in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3, 12-week study. A total of 507 patients received tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily in the morning and 508 received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (81%), with a mean age of 61 years (range, 20 to 93 years). In the study, 642 patients (42%) were 65 to 93 years of age. The study included patients known to be responsive to tolterodine immediate release and other anticholinergic medications, however, 47% of patients never received prior pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder. At study entry, 97% of patients had at least 5 urge incontinence episodes per week and 91% of patients had 8 or more micturitions per day. The primary efficacy assessment was change in mean number of incontinence episodes per week at week 12 from baseline. Secondary efficacy measures included change in mean number of micturitions per day and mean volume voided per micturition at week 12 from baseline. Patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules experienced a statistically significant decrease in number of urinary incontinence per week from baseline to last assessment (week 12) compared with placebo as well as a decrease in the average daily urinary frequency and an increase in the average urine volume per void. Mean change from baseline in weekly incontinence episodes, urinary frequency, and volume voided between placebo and tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are summarized in Table 4.

There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your condition or your treatment. Only your doctor can determine if treatment with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is right for you. What are tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules? Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are a prescription medicine for adults used to treat the following symptoms due to a condition called overactive bladder : \u2022 Having a strong need to urinate with leaking or wetting accidents (urge urinary incontinence). \u2022 Having a strong need to urinate right away (urgency). \u2022 Having to urinate often (frequency). Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules did not help the symptoms of overactive bladder when studied in children. What is overactive bladder? Overactive bladder happens when you cannot control your bladder muscle. When the muscle contracts too often or cannot be controlled, you get symptoms of overactive bladder, which are leakage of urine (urge urinary incontinence), needing to urinate right away (urgency), and needing to urinate often (frequency). Who should not take tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules? Do not take tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules if: \u2022 You have trouble emptying your bladder (also called \"urinary retention\"). \u2022 Your stomach empties slowly (also called \"gastric retention\"). \u2022 You have an eye problem called \"uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma\". \u2022 You are allergic to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or to any of its ingredients.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: use caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased gastrointestinal motility because of the risk of gastric retention. ( 5.3 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: use caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.4 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules affect them. ( 5.5 ) Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. ( 5.8 ) QT Prolongation : consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g., intestinal atony) [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ]. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ]. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] including dizziness and somnolence [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug's effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.6 ) ] . 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min). Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.7 ) ]. 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.2 ) ], the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate immediate release tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22654% and >placebo) were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Torrent Pharma Inc. at 1-800-912-9561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The efficacy and safety of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules was evaluated in 1,073 patients (537 assigned to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules; 536 assigned to placebo) who were treated with 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/day for up to 15 months. These included a total of 1,012 patients (505 randomized to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. A serious adverse event was reported by 1.4% (n=7) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and by 3.6% (n=18) of patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists the adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study at an incidence greater than placebo and in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily.

Similar percentages of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation among patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [n=12 (2.4%) vs. placebo n=6 (1.2%)]. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General: anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular: tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Gastrointestinal: diarrhea ; Central/Peripheral Nervous: confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Coadministration may increase systemic exposure to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Reduce tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules dose to 2 mg once daily. ( 7.2 ) Other Anticholinergics (antimuscarinics): Concomitant use with other anticholinergic agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects. (7.6 ) 7.1 Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 ) ]. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ] . 7.2 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, or ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3) ]. 7.3 Other Interactions No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with diuretics [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) ] . 7.4 Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) ] . 7.5 Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. 7.6 Other Anticholinergics The concomitant use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, somnolence, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects."

( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules use in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite to pregnant mice during organogenesis did not produce adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day; however, higher doses produced adverse developmental outcomes (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No anomalies or malformations were observed after oral administration of tolterodine to pregnant mice during organogenesis at approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on the AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day). At 14 to 18 times the clinical exposure (doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day) in mice, tolterodine was embryo-lethal, caused reduced fetal weight, and increased the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification). Pregnant rabbits administered tolterodine subcutaneously at about 0.3 to 2.5 times the clinical exposure (dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day) did not show any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of tolterodine or its 5-HMT metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Based on limited data, tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice in low amounts (see Data) . The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data The use of radiolabeled tolterodine in pregnant mice produced milk: plasma ratios that ranged between 0.0 and 0.7. 8.4 Pediatric Use The effectiveness of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules has not been established in pediatric patients. Efficacy was not established in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies that enrolled 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 224 on placebo) aged 5 to 10 years with urinary frequency and urge incontinence. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients treated with tolterodine. In multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of 5-HMT were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another clinical study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than concentrations reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in the Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended. 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine and 5-HMT levels were approximately 2 to 3 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N- dealkylated tolterodine, and N -dealkylated hydroxy tolterodine) were significantly higher (10 to 30 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dose for patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg daily. Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.6 ) ] . Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules have not been studied in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [CCr 30 to 80 mL/min]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study of tolterodine immediate release conducted in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh Class A and B), the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.4 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine tartrate immediate release (tolterodine IR) tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.2 )]. QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QTc) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia's (QTcF) and a population-specific (QTcP) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (Cl) change in QTc from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) at T max (relative to placebo) Drug/Dose N QT c F QT c F QT c P QT c P Tolterodine 2 mg BID* 48 5.01 (0.28, 9.74) 1.16 (-2.99, 5.30) 4.45 (-0.37, 9.26) 2.00 (-1.81, 5.81) Tolterodine 4 mg BID* 48 11.84 (7.11, 16.58) 5.63 (1.48, 9.77) 10.31 (5.49, 15.12) 8.34 (4.53, 12.15) Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD\u2020 45 19.26\u2021 (15.49, 23.03) 8.90 (4.77, 13.03) 19.10\u2021 (15.32, 22.89) 9.29 (5.34, 13.24) *At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval. \u2020At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval. \u2021The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing inthis QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs. The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine's effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QTc interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate immediate-release tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\"active moiety\"), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food: There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%.The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3.

Drug Interactions: Potent CYP2D6 inhibitors : Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors : The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) ]. Warfarin : In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives : Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg/levo-norgestrel 150 mcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes: Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (K i 1.05 \u03bcM), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), exposure margins were approximately 6 to 9 times, 7 times, and 11 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite). At these exposure margins, no increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic or genotoxic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli, a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (about 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure via AUC), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg were evaluated in 29 patients in a Phase 2 dose-effect study. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence and frequency in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3, 12-week study. A total of 507 patients received tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily in the morning and 508 received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (81%), with a mean age of 61 years (range, 20 to 93 years). In the study, 642 patients (42%) were 65 to 93 years of age. The study included patients known to be responsive to tolterodine immediate release and other anticholinergic medications, however, 47% of patients never received prior pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder. At study entry, 97% of patients had at least 5 urge incontinence episodes per week and 91% of patients had 8 or more micturitions per day. The primary efficacy assessment was change in mean number of incontinence episodes per week at week 12 from baseline. Secondary efficacy measures included change in mean number of micturitions per day and mean volume voided per micturition at week 12 from baseline. Patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules experienced a statistically significant decrease in number of urinary incontinence per week from baseline to last assessment (week 12) compared with placebo as well as a decrease in the average daily urinary frequency and an increase in the average urine volume per void. Mean change from baseline in weekly incontinence episodes, urinary frequency, and volume voided between placebo and tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are summarized in Table 4.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. (5.1) \u2022 Urinary Retention: use caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. (5.2) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased gastrointestinal motility because of the risk of gastric retention. (5.3) \u2022 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: use caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. (5.4) \u2022 Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules affects them (5.5). \u2022 Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. (5.8) \u2022 QT Prolongation: consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. (5.9) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g., intestinal atony) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] including dizziness and somnolence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )]. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug\u2019s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6)]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min). Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7 )]. 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.2 )] , the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate immediate release tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence >4% and >placebo) were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hetero Labs Limited at 1-866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The efficacy and safety of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules was evaluated in 1073 patients (537 assigned to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules; 536 assigned to placebo) who were treated with 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/day for up to 15 months. These included a total of 1012 patients (505 randomized to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. A serious adverse event was reported by 1.4% (n=7) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and by 3.6% (n=18) of patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists the adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study at an incidence greater than placebo and in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily. Table 1.

The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Similar percentages of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation among patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [n=12 (2.4%) vs. placebo n=6 (1.2%)]. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General: anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular: tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Gastrointestinal: diarrhea; Central/Peripheral Nervous: confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Coadministration may increase systemic exposure to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Reduce tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules dose to 2 mg once daily. (7.2) \u2022 Other Anticholinergics (antimuscarinics): Concomitant use with other anticholinergic agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects. (7.6) 7.1 Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3)]. 7.2 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, or ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Other Interactions No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with diuretics [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3)] 7.4 Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3)]. 7.5 Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. 7.6 Other Anticholinergics The concomitant use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, somnolence, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy and Lactation: Tolterodine tartrate extended- release capsules should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should not be administered during nursing. ( 8.1 , 8.3) \u2022 Pediatric Use: Efficacy in the pediatric population has not been demonstrated. Safety information from a study of a total of 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 224 on placebo) is available. ( 8.4) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with CCr <10 mL/min. Dose adjustment in severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min). (8.6) \u2022 Hepatic Impairment: Not recommended for use in severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C). Dose adjustment in mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A, B). (8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C. At approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, no anomalies or malformations were observed in mice (based on the AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day). At 14 to 18 times the exposure (doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day) in mice, tolterodine has been shown to be embryolethal and reduce fetal weight, and increase the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification). Pregnant rabbits treated subcutaneously at about 0.3 to 2.5 times the clinical exposure (dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day) did not show any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. There are no studies of tolterodine in pregnant women. Therefore, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice. Offspring of female mice treated with tolterodine 20 mg/kg/day during the lactation period had slightly reduced body weight gain. The offspring regained the weight during the maturation phase. It is not known whether tolterodine is excreted in human milk; therefore, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should not be administered during nursing. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in nursing mothers. 8.4 Pediatric Use Efficacy in the pediatric population has not been demonstrated. The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release capsules have been evaluated in pediatric patients ranging in age from 11 to 15 years. The dose-plasma concentration relationship was linear over the range of doses assessed. Parent/metabolite ratios differed according to CYP2D6 metabolizer status [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers had low serum concentrations of tolterodine and high concentrations of the active metabolite 5-HMT, while poor metabolizers had high concentrations of tolterodine and negligible active metabolite concentrations. A total of 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 224 on placebo) aged 5 to 10 with urinary frequency and urge incontinence were studied in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients treated with tolterodine. In multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of 5-HMT were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another clinical study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than concentrations reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in the Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended. 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine and 5-HMT levels were approximately 2 to 3 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine, and N -dealkylated hydroxy tolterodine) were significantly higher (10 to 30 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dose for patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg daily. Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.6)]. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules have not been studied in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [CCr 30 to 80 mL/min]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study of tolterodine immediate release conducted in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh Class A and B), the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.4)]. 8.8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are not influenced by gender. Mean C max of tolterodine immediate release (1.6 mcg/L in males versus 2.2 mcg/L in females) and the active 5-HMT (2.2 mcg/L in males versus 2.5 mcg/L in females) are similar in males and females who were administered tolterodine immediate release 2 mg. Mean AUC values of tolterodine (6.7 mcg\u2022h/L in males versus 7.8 mcg\u2022h/L in females) and 5-HMT (10 mcg\u2022h/L in males versus 11 mcg\u2022h/L in females) are also similar. The elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release for both males and females is 2.4 hours, and the half-life of 5-HMT is 3 hours in females and 3.3 hours in males. 8.9 Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been established."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine tartrate immediate release tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2 )]. QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QT c ) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia\u2019s (QT c F) and a population-specific (QT c P) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2.

The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine\u2019s effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QT c interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate immediate release tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\u201cactive moiety\u201d), the AUC of tolterodine extended-release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food: There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d) is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N-dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \u201cextensive metabolizers.\u201d Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (< 2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3.

Drug Interactions: Potent CYP2D6 inhibitors : Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors : The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3 )]. Warfarin : In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives : Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg/levo-norgestrel 150 mcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics : Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes : Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u03bcM), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\u201cactive moiety\u201d), the AUC of tolterodine extended-release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food: There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d) is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N-dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \u201cextensive metabolizers.\u201d Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (< 2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3.

Drug Interactions: Potent CYP2D6 inhibitors : Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors : The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3 )]. Warfarin : In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives : Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg/levo-norgestrel 150 mcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics : Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes : Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u03bcM), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg were evaluated in 29 patients in a Phase 2 dose-effect study. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence and frequency in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3, 12-week study. A total of 507 patients received tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily in the morning and 508 received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (81%), with a mean age of 61 years (range, 20 to 93 years). In the study, 642 patients (42%) were 65 to 93 years of age. The study included patients known to be responsive to tolterodine immediate release and other anticholinergic medications, however, 47% of patients never received prior pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder. At study entry, 97% of patients had at least 5 urge incontinence episodes per week and 91% of patients had 8 or more micturitions per day. The primary efficacy assessment was change in mean number of incontinence episodes per week at week 12 from baseline. Secondary efficacy measures included change in mean number of micturitions per day and mean volume voided per micturition at week 12 from baseline. Patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules experienced a statistically significant decrease in number of urinary incontinence per week from baseline to last assessment (week 12) compared with placebo as well as a decrease in the average daily urinary frequency and an increase in the average urine volume per void.

There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your condition or your treatment. Only your doctor can determine if treatment with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is right for you. What are tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules? Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsule is a prescription medicine for adults used to treat the following symptoms due to a condition called overactive bladder: \u2022 Having a strong need to urinate with leaking or wetting accidents (urge urinary incontinence). \u2022 Having a strong need to urinate right away (urgency). \u2022 Having to urinate often (frequency). Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules did not help the symptoms of overactive bladder when studied in children. What is overactive bladder? Overactive bladder happens when you cannot control your bladder muscle. When the muscle contracts too often or cannot be controlled, you get symptoms of overactive bladder, which are leakage of urine (urge urinary incontinence), needing to urinate right away (urgency), and needing to urinate often (frequency). Who should not take tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules? Do not take tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules if: \u2022 You have trouble emptying your bladder (also called \u201curinary retention\u201d). \u2022 Your stomach empties slowly (also called \u201cgastric retention\u201d). \u2022 You have an eye problem called \u201cuncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma\u201d. \u2022 You are allergic to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or to any of its ingredients. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients. \u2022 You are allergic to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, which contains fesoterodine. What should I tell my doctor before starting tolterodine tartrate extended- release capsules? Before starting tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: \u2022 Have any stomach or intestinal problems. \u2022 Have trouble emptying your bladder or you have a weak urine stream. \u2022 Have an eye problem called narrow-angle glaucoma. \u2022 Have liver problems. \u2022 Have kidney problems. \u2022 Have a condition called myasthenia gravis. \u2022 Or any family members have a rare heart condition called QT prolongation (long QT syndrome). \u2022 Are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. It is not known if tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules could harm your unborn baby. \u2022 Are breastfeeding. It is not known if tolterodine tartrate passes into your milk and if it can harm your child.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, a major pharmacologically active metabolite. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. Tolterodine immediate release is rapidly absorbed, and maximum serum concentrations (C max ) typically occur within 1 to 2 hours after dose administration. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Effect of Food: Food intake increases the bioavailability of tolterodine (average increase 53%), but does not affect the levels of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive metabolizers. This change is not expected to be a safety concern and adjustment of dose is not needed. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0 %. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset (about 7%) of the population is devoid of CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite of tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\u201c\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d\u201d) is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \u201cextensive metabolizers.\u201d Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 1. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine 4 mg administered twice daily to 16 healthy male volunteers (8 EM, 8 PM). Table 1. Summary of Mean (\u00b1SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Tolterodine and its Active Metabolite (5- hydroxymethyl metabolite) in Healthy Volunteers * Parameter was dose-normalized from 4 mg to 2 mg. C max = Maximum plasma concentration; t max = Time of occurrence of C max ; C avg = Average plasma concentration; t 1/2 = Terminal elimination half-life; CL/F = Apparent oral clearance. EM = Extensive metabolizers; PM = Poor metabolizers. \u2020 \u2020= not applicable. table-1 Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: In Phase 1, multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another Phase 1 study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use ). Pediatric: The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine have not been established in pediatric patients. Gender: The pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are not influenced by gender. Mean C max of tolterodine (1.6 mcg/L in males versus 2.2 mcg/L in females) and the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (2.2 mcg/L in males versus 2.5 mcg/L in females) are similar in males and females who were administered tolterodine immediate release 2 mg. Mean AUC values of tolterodine (6.7 mcg\u2022\u2022h/L in males versus 7.8 mcg\u2022\u2022\u2022h/L in females) and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (10 mcg\u2022\u2022\u2022h/L in males versus 11 mcg\u2022\u2022\u2022h/L in females) are also similar. The elimination half-life of tolterodine for both males and females is 2.4 hours, and the half-life of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite is 3 hours in females and 3.3 hours in males. Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been established. Renal Insufficiency: Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite levels were approximately 2 to 3 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine, and N -dealkylated hydroxylated tolterodine) were significantly higher (10 to 30 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dosage for patients with significantly reduced renal function is tolterodine tartrate tablets 1 mg twice daily (see PRECAUTIONS , General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency: Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study conducted in cirrhotic patients, the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with significantly reduced hepatic function is tolterodine tartrate tablets 1 mg twice daily (see PRECAUTIONS , General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug-Drug Interactions Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required whentolterodine tartrate tablets and fluoxetine are coadministered. Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes: Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes. CYP3A4 Inhibitors: The effect of 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were poor metabolizers (see Pharmacokinetics , Variability in Metabolism for discussion of poor metabolizers). In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2 and 2.5 fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Warfarin: In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives: Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg /levonorgestrel 150 mcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel over a 2-month cycle in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine immediate release (IR) on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ). QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QTc) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia\u2019\u2019s (QTcF) and a population-specific (QTcP) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (CI) change in QTc from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) at T max (relative to placebo) 1 At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval 2 At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval 3 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine\u2019\u2019s effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QTc interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine extended-release capsules (see PRECAUTIONS , Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation ). table-2"

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tartrate tablets were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies. A total of 853 patients received tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg twice daily and 685 patients received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (78%), with a mean age of 60 years (range, 19 to 93 years). At study entry, nearly all patients perceived they had urgency and most patients had increased frequency of micturitions and urge incontinence. These characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups for the studies. The efficacy endpoints for study 007 (see Table 3) included the change from baseline for: \u2022\u2022 Number of incontinence episodes per week \u2022 Number of micturitions per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days) \u2022 Volume of urine voided per micturition (averaged over 2 days) The efficacy endpoints for studies 008, 009, and 010 (see Table 4) were identical to the above endpoints with the exception that the number of incontinence episodes was per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days).

    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Tolterodine tartrate tablets are contraindicated in patients with urinary retention, gastric retention, or uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma. Tolterodine tartrate tablets is also contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients, or to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets which, like tolterodine tartrate tablets, are metabolized to 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine."

      "WARNINGS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate tablets. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Risk of Urinary Retention and Gastric Retention: Tolterodine tartrate tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention and to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders, such as pyloric stenosis, because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility: Tolterodine tartrate tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Tolterodine tartrate tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects: Tolterodine tartrate tablet is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects including dizziness and somnolence (see Adverse Reactions). Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug\u2019\u2019s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Reduced Hepatic and Renal Function: For patients with significantly reduced hepatic function or renal function, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate tablets is 1 mg twice daily (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations ). Myasthenia Gravis: Tolterodine tartrate tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Cardiac Electrophysiology ), the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate tablets for patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ). There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that antimuscarinic agents such as tolterodine tartrate tablets may produce the following effects: blurred vision, dizziness, or drowsiness. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until the drug's effects have been determined. LABORATORY TESTS Drug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, significantly increased plasma concentrations of tolterodine when coadministered to subjects who were poor metabolizers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Variability in Metabolism and Drug-Drug Interactions ). For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate tablets is 1 mg twice daily (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), AUC values obtained for tolterodine were 355, 291, and 462 mcg\u2022h/L, respectively. In comparison, the human AUC value for a 2 mg dose administered twice daily is estimated at 34 mcg\u2022h/L. Thus, tolterodine exposure in the carcinogenicity studies was 9- to 14- fold higher than expected in humans. No increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli , a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (corresponding to AUC value of about 500 mcg\u2022h/L), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. Based on AUC values, the systemic exposure was about 15-fold higher in animals than in humans. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C. At oral doses of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 14 times the human exposure), no anomalies or malformations were observed in mice. When given at doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day, tolterodine has been shown to be embryolethal, reduce fetal weight, and increase the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification) in mice. At these doses, the AUC values were about 20- to 25-fold higher than in humans. Rabbits treated subcutaneously at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day achieved an AUC of 100 mcg\u2022h/L, which is about 3-fold higher than that resulting from the human dose. This dose did not result in any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. There are no studies of tolterodine in pregnant women. Therefore, tolterodine tartrate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice. Offspring of female mice treated with tolterodine 20 mg/kg/day during the lactation period had slightly reduced body weight gain. The offspring regained the weight during the maturation phase. It is not known whether tolterodine is excreted in human milk; therefore, tolterodine tartrate tablets should not be administered during nursing. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue tolterodine tartrate tablets in nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Efficacy in the pediatric population has not been demonstrated. Two pediatric phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies were conducted using tolterodine extended release capsules. A total of 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine extended release capsules and 224 on placebo) aged 5 to 10 years with urinary frequency and urge urinary incontinence were studied. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine extended release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine extended release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. Geriatric Use Of the 1120 patients who were treated in the four Phase 3, 12-week clinical studies of tolterodine tartrate tablets, 474 (42%) were 65 to 91 years of age. No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations )."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial program for tolterodine tartrate tablets included 3071 patients who were treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets (N=2133) or placebo (N=938). The patients were treated with 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/day for up to 12 months. No differences in the safety profile of tolterodine were identified based on age, gender, race, or metabolism. The data described below reflect exposure to tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five Phase 3, controlled clinical studies. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and approximating rates. Sixty-six percent of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid reported adverse events versus 56% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate tablets were dry mouth, headache, constipation, vertigo/dizziness, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and xerophthalmia are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in the Phase 3 clinical studies, occurring in 34.8% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets and 9.8% of placebo-treated patients. One percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets discontinued treatment due to dry mouth. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Seven percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid discontinued treatment due to adverse events versus 6% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of tolterodine tartrate tablets were dizziness and headache. Three percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid reported a serious adverse event versus 4% of placebo patients. Significant ECG changes in QT and QTc have not been demonstrated in clinical-study patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid. Table 5 lists the adverse events reported in 1% or more of the patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in the 12-week studies. The adverse events are reported regardless of causality. Table 5.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: use caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased gastrointestinal motility because of the risk of gastric retention. ( 5.3 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: use caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.4 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules affect them. ( 5.5 ) Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. ( 5.8 ) QT Prolongation: consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g. intestinal atony) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] including dizziness and somnolence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug\u2019s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended release-capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS(8.6) ]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10-30 mL/min). Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7) ] . 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction . 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) ] , the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine immediate release tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules."

      "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence > 4% and >placebo) were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Inventia Healthcare Limited, at 1-800-270-7585 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The efficacy and safety of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules was evaluated in 1073 patients (537 assigned to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules; 536 assigned to placebo) who were treated with 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/day for up to 15 months. These included a total of 1012 patients (505 randomized to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. A serious adverse event was reported by 1.4% (n=7) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and by 3.6% (n=18) of patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists the adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study at an incidence greater than placebo and in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily.

Similar percentages of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation among patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [n=12 (2.4%) vs. placebo n=6 (1.2%)]. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General: anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular: tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Gastrointestinal : diarrhea ; Central/Peripheral Nervous: confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

Reduce tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules dose to 2 mg once daily. ( 7.2 ) Other Anticholinergics (antimuscarinics): Concomitant use with other anticholinergic agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.1) ] . The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.2 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin or ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended release capsules is 2 mg once daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ] . 7.3 Other interactions No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with diuretics [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.4 Other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.5 Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. 7.6 Other Anticholinergics The concomitant use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, somnolence and other anticholienrgic pharmacological effects."

In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite to pregnant mice during organogenesis did not produce adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day; however, higher doses produced adverse developmental outcomes (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No anomalies or malformations were observed after oral administration of tolterodine to pregnant mice during organogenesis at approximately 9-12 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on the AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day). At 1418 times the clinical exposure (doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day) in mice, tolterodine was embryo-lethal, caused reduced fetal weight, and increased the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification). Pregnant rabbits administered tolterodine subcutaneously at about 0.3-2.5 times the clinical exposure (dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day) did not show any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of tolterodine or its 5-HMT metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Based on limited data, tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice in low amounts ( see Data ). The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data The use of radiolabeled tolterodine in pregnant mice produced milk: plasma ratios that ranged between 0.0 and 0.7. 8.4 Pediatric Use The effectiveness of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules has not been established in pediatric patients. Efficacy was not established in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies that enrolled 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 224 on placebo) aged 5\u201310 years with urinary frequency and urge incontinence. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients treated with tolterodine. In multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of 5-HMT were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another clinical study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than concentrations reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in the Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended. 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine and 5-HMT levels were approximately 2\u20133 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N- dealkylated tolterodine and N -dealkylated hydroxy tolterodine) were significantly higher (10\u201330 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dose for patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10-30 mL/min) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg daily. Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5.6) ] .Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules have not been studied in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [CCr 30-80 mL/min]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study of tolterodine immediate release conducted in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh Class A and B), the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6) ] ."

ECG monitoring is recommended in the event of overdosage. In dogs, changes in the QT interval (slight prolongation of 10% to 20%) were observed at a suprapharmacologic dose of 4.5 mg/kg, which is about 68 times higher than the recommended human dose. In clinical trials of normal volunteers and patients, QT interval prolongation was observed with tolterodine immediate release at doses up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) and higher doses were not evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) ] .

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine tartrate immediate release (tolterodine IR) tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18\u201355 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) ]. QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QT c ) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia's (QT c F) and a population-specific (QT c P) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (CI) change in QT c from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) at T max (relative to placebo) * At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval. \u2020 At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval. \u2021 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs.

The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine's effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QT c interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\"active moiety\"), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food: There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (< 2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM).

In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors : The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) ] . Warfarin : In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives : Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u03bcg/levo-norgestrel 150 \u03bcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes: Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (K i 1.05 \u03bcM), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine tartrate immediate release (tolterodine IR) tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18\u201355 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) ]. QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QT c ) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia's (QT c F) and a population-specific (QT c P) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (CI) change in QT c from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) at T max (relative to placebo) * At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval. \u2020 At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval. \u2021 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs. Drug/Dose N QT c F (msec) (manual) QT c F (msec) (machine) QT c P (msec) (manual) QT c F (msec) (machine) Tolterodine 2 mg BID * 48 5.01 (0.28,9.74) 1.16 (-2.99,5.30) 4.45 (-0.37,9.26) 2.00 (-1.81,5.81) Tolterodine 4 mg BID * 48 11.84 (7.11,16.58) 5.63 (1.48,9.77) 10.31 (5.49,15.12) 8.34 (4.53,12.15) Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD \u2020 45 19.26 \u2021 (15.49,23.03) 8.90 (4.77,13.03) 19.10 \u2021 (15.32,22.89) 9.29 (5.34,13.24) The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine's effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QT c interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9) ] ."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\"active moiety\"), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food: There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\"poor metabolizers\") is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \"extensive metabolizers.\" Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (< 2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3 Summary of Mean (\u00b1SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Tolterodine Extended Release and its Active Metabolite (5-Hydroxymethyl Tolterodine) in Healthy Volunteers C max = Maximum serum concentration; t max = Time of occurrence of Cmax; C avg = Average serum concentration; t 1/2 = Terminal elimination half-life. * Parameter dose-normalized from 8 to 4 mg for the single-dose data. \u2020Data presented as median (range). \u2021 = not applicable.

In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors : The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) ] . Warfarin : In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives : Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u03bcg/levo-norgestrel 150 \u03bcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes: Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (K i 1.05 \u03bcM), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

      "13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), exposure margins were approximately 6-9 times, 7 times, and 11 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite). At these exposure margins, no increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic or genotoxic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli, a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (about 9-12 times the clinical exposure via AUC), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility."

      "14. CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg were evaluated in 29 patients in a Phase 2 dose-effect study. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg was evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence and frequency in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3, 12-week study. A total of 507 patients received tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily in the morning and 508 received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (81%), with a mean age of 61 years (range, 20 to 93 years). In the study, 642 patients (42%) were 65 to 93 years of age. The study included patients known to be responsive to tolterodine immediate release and other anticholinergic medications, however, 47% of patients never received prior pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder. At study entry, 97% of patients had at least 5 urge incontinence episodes per week and 91% of patients had 8 or more micturitions per day. The primary efficacy assessment was change in mean number of incontinence episodes per week at week 12 from baseline. Secondary efficacy measures included change in mean number of micturitions per day and mean volume voided per micturition at week 12 from baseline. Patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules experienced a statistically significant decrease in number of urinary incontinence per week from baseline to last assessment (week 12) compared with placebo as well as a decrease in the average daily urinary frequency and an increase in the average urine volume per void. Mean change from baseline in weekly incontinence episodes, urinary frequency, and volume voided between placebo and tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are summarized in Table 4.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: use caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased gastrointestinal motility because of the risk of gastric retention. ( 5.3 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: use caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.4 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules affects them ( 5.5 ). Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. ( 5.8 ) QT Prolongation: consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 )]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g., intestinal atony) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 )]. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 )]. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.2 )] including dizziness and somnolence [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.1 )] . Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug\u2019s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsule is 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.6 )]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 mL/min to 30 mL/min). Patients with CCr less than 10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.7 )]. 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.2 )] , the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 4% and greater than placebo) were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ajanta Pharma USA Inc. at 1-855-664-7744 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The efficacy and safety of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules was evaluated in 1073 patients (537 assigned to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules; 536 assigned to placebo) who were treated with 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/day for up to 15 months. These included a total of 1012 patients (505 randomized to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. A serious adverse event was reported by 1.4% (n=7) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and by 3.6% (n=18) of patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists the adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study at an incidence greater than placebo and in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily.

Similar percentages of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation among patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [n=12 (2.4%) vs. placebo n=6 (1.2%)]. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General : anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular : tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Gastrointestinal : diarrhea; Central/Peripheral Nervous : confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

Reduce tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules dose to 2 mg once daily. ( 7.2 ) Other Anticholinergics (antimuscarinics): Concomitant use with other anticholinergic agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, or ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsule is 2 mg once daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Other Interactions No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with diuretics [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 7.4 Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 7.5 Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. 7.6 Other Anticholinergics The concomitant use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, somnolence, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with CCr less than 10 mL/min. Dose adjustment in severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 mL/min to 30 mL/min). ( 8.6 ) Hepatic Impairment: Not recommended for use in severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C). Dose adjustment in mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A, B). ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules use in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite to pregnant mice during organogenesis did not produce adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day; however, higher doses produced adverse developmental outcomes (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No anomalies or malformations were observed after oral administration of tolterodine to pregnant mice during organogenesis at approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on the AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day). At 14 to 18 times the clinical exposure (doses of 30 mg/kg/day to 40 mg/kg/day) in mice, tolterodine was embryo-lethal, caused reduced fetal weight, and increased the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification). Pregnant rabbits administered tolterodine subcutaneously at about 0.3 to 2.5 times the clinical exposure (dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day) did not show any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of tolterodine or its 5-HMT metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Based on limited data, tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice in low amounts (see Data) . The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data The use of radiolabeled tolterodine in pregnant mice produced milk: plasma ratios that ranged between 0.0 and 0.7. 8.4 Pediatric Use The effectiveness of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules has not been established in pediatric patients. Efficacy was not established in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies that enrolled 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 224 on placebo) aged 5 to10 years with urinary frequency and urge incontinence. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients treated with tolterodine. In multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of 5-HMT were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another clinical study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than concentrations reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in the Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended. 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine and 5-HMT levels were approximately 2 to 3 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N-dealkylated tolterodine acid, N-dealkylated tolterodine, and N-dealkylated hydroxy tolterodine) were significantly higher (10 to 30 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dose for patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 mL/min to 30 mL/min) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg daily. Patients with CCr less than 10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.6 )] . Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules has not been studied in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [CCr 30 mL/min to 80 mL/min]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study of tolterodine immediate release conducted in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh Class A and B), the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.4 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine tartrate immediate release tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4-day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.2 )]. QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QTc) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia\u2019s (QTcF) and a population-specific (QTcP) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (CI) change in QT c from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) at T max (relative to placebo) * At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval. \u2020 At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval. \u2021 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs.

The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine\u2019s effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QTc interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption : In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\u201cactive moiety\u201d), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food : There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution : Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism : Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N-dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d) is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N-dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \u201cextensive metabolizers.\u201d Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion : Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (less than 2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (less than 1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3. Summary of Mean (\u00b1SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Tolterodine Extended Release and its Active Metabolite (5-Hydroxymethyl Tolterodine) in Healthy Volunteers C max = Maximum serum concentration; t max = Time of occurrence of C max ;C avg = Average serum concentration; t 1/2 = Terminal elimination half-life. *Data presented as median (range). \u2020Parameter dose-normalized from 8 to 4 mg for the single-dose data. \u2021 = not applicable.

In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsule is 2 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.3 )]. Warfarin: In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives: Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u03bcg/levo-norgestrel 150 \u03bcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes : Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u03bcM), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption : In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\u201cactive moiety\u201d), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food : There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution : Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism : Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N-dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d) is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N-dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \u201cextensive metabolizers.\u201d Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion : Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (less than 2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (less than 1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3. Summary of Mean (\u00b1SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Tolterodine Extended Release and its Active Metabolite (5-Hydroxymethyl Tolterodine) in Healthy Volunteers C max = Maximum serum concentration; t max = Time of occurrence of C max ;C avg = Average serum concentration; t 1/2 = Terminal elimination half-life. *Data presented as median (range). \u2020Parameter dose-normalized from 8 to 4 mg for the single-dose data. \u2021 = not applicable.

In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsule is 2 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.3 )]. Warfarin: In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives: Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 \u03bcg/levo-norgestrel 150 \u03bcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes : Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u03bcM), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 2 mg were evaluated in 29 patients in a Phase 2 dose-effect study. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg was evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence and frequency in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3, 12-week study. A total of 507 patients received tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily in the morning and 508 received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (81%), with a mean age of 61 years (range, 20 to 93 years). In the study, 642 patients (42%) were 65 to 93 years of age. The study included patients known to be responsive to tolterodine immediate release and other anticholinergic medications, however, 47% of patients never received prior pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder. At study entry, 97% of patients had at least 5 urge incontinence episodes per week and 91% of patients had 8 or more micturitions per day. The primary efficacy assessment was change in mean number of incontinence episodes per week at week 12 from baseline. Secondary efficacy measures included change in mean number of micturitions per day and mean volume voided per micturition at week 12 from baseline. Patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules experienced a statistically significant decrease in number of urinary incontinence per week from baseline to last assessment (week 12) compared with placebo as well as a decrease in the average daily urinary frequency and an increase in the average urine volume per void. Mean change from baseline in weekly incontinence episodes, urinary frequency, and volume voided between placebo and tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are summarized in Table 4.

There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your condition or your treatment. Only your doctor can determine if treatment with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is right for you. What are tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules? Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are a prescription medicine for adults used to treat the following symptoms due to a condition called overactive bladder : Having a strong need to urinate with leaking or wetting accidents (urge urinary incontinence). Having a strong need to urinate right away (urgency). Having to urinate often (frequency). Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules did not help the symptoms of overactive bladder when studied in children. What is overactive bladder ? Overactive bladder happens when you cannot control your bladder muscle. When the muscle contracts too often or cannot be controlled, you get symptoms of overactive bladder, which are leakage of urine (urge urinary incontinence), needing to urinate right away (urgency), and needing to urinate often (frequency). Who should not take tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules? Do not take tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules if: You have trouble emptying your bladder (also called \u201curinary retention\u201d). Your stomach empties slowly (also called \u201cgastric retention\u201d). You have an eye problem called \u201cuncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma\u201d. You are allergic to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or to any of its ingredients. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: use caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased gastrointestinal motility because of the risk of gastric retention. ( 5.3 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: use caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.4 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules affect them ( 5.5 ) Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. ( 5.8 ) QT Prolongation: consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g., intestinal atony) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ]. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ]. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.2 ) ] including dizziness and somnolence [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.1 ) ]. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug\u2019s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.6 ) ]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min). Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.7 ) ]. 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction . 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.2 ) ], the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22654% and >placebo) were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The efficacy and safety of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules was evaluated in 1073 patients (537 assigned to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules; 536 assigned to placebo) who were treated with 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/day for up to 15 months. These included a total of 1012 patients (505 randomized to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12 week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. A serious adverse event was reported by 1.4% (n=7) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and by 3.6% (n=18) of patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists the adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study at an incidence greater than placebo and in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 4 mg once daily.

The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Similar percentages of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation among patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [n=12 (2.4%) vs. placebo n=6 (1.2%)]. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General : anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular : tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Gastrointestina l: diarrhea ; Central/Peripheral Nervous : confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Coadministration may increase systemic exposure to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Reduce tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules dose to 2 mg once daily. ( 7.2 ) Other Anticholinergics (antimuscarinics): Concomitant use with other anticholinergic agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8 fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 ) ]. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.2 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5 fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, or ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.3 Other Interactions No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with diuretics [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.4 Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.5 Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. 7.6 Other Anticholinergics The concomitant use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, somnolence, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with CCr <10 mL/min. Dose adjustment in severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min). ( 8.6 ) Hepatic Impairment: Not recommended for use in severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C). Dose adjustment in mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A, B). ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules use in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite to pregnant mice during organogenesis did not produce adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day; however, higher doses produced adverse developmental outcomes (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No anomalies or malformations were observed after oral administration of tolterodine to pregnant mice during organogenesis at approximately 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on the AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day). At 14 to 18 times the clinical exposure (doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day) in mice, tolterodine was embryo-lethal, caused reduced fetal weight, and increased the incidence of fetal abnormalities (cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification). Pregnant rabbits administered tolterodine subcutaneously at about 0.3 to 2.5 times the clinical exposure (dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day) did not show any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of tolterodine or its 5-HMT metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Based on limited data, tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice in low amounts (see Data) . The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data The use of radiolabeled tolterodine in pregnant mice produced milk: plasma ratios that ranged between 0.0 and 0.7. 8.4 Pediatric Use The effectiveness of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules has not been established in pediatric patients. Efficacy was not established in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies that enrolled 710 pediatric patients (486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 224 on placebo) aged 5 to 10 years with urinary frequency and urge incontinence. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (6.6%) compared to patients who received placebo (4.5%). Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients treated with tolterodine. In multiple-dose studies in which tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) was administered, serum concentrations of tolterodine and of 5-HMT were similar in healthy elderly volunteers (aged 64 through 80 years) and healthy young volunteers (aged less than 40 years). In another clinical study, elderly volunteers (aged 71 through 81 years) were given tolterodine immediate release 2 or 4 mg (1 or 2 mg bid). Mean serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT in these elderly volunteers were approximately 20% and 50% higher, respectively, than concentrations reported in young healthy volunteers. However, no overall differences were observed in safety between older and younger patients on tolterodine in the Phase 3, 12-week, controlled clinical studies; therefore, no tolterodine dosage adjustment for elderly patients is recommended. 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites. In a study conducted in patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 mL/min, tolterodine and 5-HMT levels were approximately 2 to 3 fold higher in patients with renal impairment than in healthy volunteers. Exposure levels of other metabolites of tolterodine (e.g., tolterodine acid, N -dealkylated tolterodine acid, N- dealkylated tolterodine , and N -dealkylated hydroxy tolterodine) were significantly higher (10 to 30 fold) in renally impaired patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The recommended dose for patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 2 mg daily. Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.6 ) ]. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules have not been studied in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [CCr 30 to 80 mL/min]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Liver impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine immediate release. In a study of tolterodine immediate release conducted in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh Class A and B), the elimination half-life of tolterodine immediate release was longer in cirrhotic patients (mean, 7.8 hours) than in healthy, young, and elderly volunteers (mean, 2 to 4 hours). The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients (1.0 \u00b1 1.7 L/h/kg) than in the healthy volunteers (5.7 \u00b1 3.8 L/h/kg). The recommended dose for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) is tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.6 ) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine tartrate immediate release (tolterodine IR) tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4 way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4 day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.2 ) ]. QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QT c ) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia\u2019s (QT c F) and a population-specific (QT c P) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (CI) change in QTc from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) at Tmax (relative to placebo) Drug/Dose N QT c F QT c F QT c P QT c P (msec) (msec) (msec) (msec) (manual) (machine) (manual) (machine) Tolterodine 2 mg BID * 48 5.01 1.16 4.45 2.00 (0.28, 9.74) (-2.99, 5.30) (-0.37, 9.26) (-1.81, 5.81) Tolterodine 4 mg BID * 48 11.84 5.63 10.31 8.34 (7.11, 16.58) (1.48, 9.77) (5.49, 15.12) (4.53, 12.15) Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD \u2020 45 19.26 \u2021 8.90 19.10 \u2021 9.29 (15.49, 23.03) (4.77, 13.03) (15.32, 22.89) (5.34, 13.24) * At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval. \u2020 At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval. \u2021 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs. The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine\u2019s effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QT c interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 ) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\u201cactive moiety\u201d), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food: There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d) is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \u201cextensive metabolizers.\u201d Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3.

Drug Interactions: Potent CYP2D6 inhibitors: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.3 ) ]. Warfarin: In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives: Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg/levo-norgestrel 150 mcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes: Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolterodine acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the major pharmacologically active metabolite. 5-HMT, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and 5-HMT exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. Effects on urodynamic parameters before and 1 and 5 hours after a single 6.4 mg dose of tolterodine immediate release were determined in healthy volunteers. The main effects of tolterodine at 1 and 5 hours were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID of tolterodine tartrate immediate release (tolterodine IR) tablets on the QT interval was evaluated in a 4 way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg QD) study in healthy male (N=25) and female (N=23) volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. Study subjects [approximately equal representation of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs)] completed sequential 4 day periods of dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg QD, tolterodine 2 mg BID, tolterodine 4 mg BID, and placebo. The 4 mg BID dose of tolterodine IR (two times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose results in tolterodine exposure similar to that observed upon coadministration of tolterodine 2 mg BID with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.2 ) ]. QT interval was measured over a 12-hour period following dosing, including the time of peak plasma concentration (T max ) of tolterodine and at steady state (Day 4 of dosing). Table 2 summarizes the mean change from baseline to steady state in corrected QT interval (QT c ) relative to placebo at the time of peak tolterodine (1 hour) and moxifloxacin (2 hour) concentrations. Both Fridericia\u2019s (QT c F) and a population-specific (QT c P) method were used to correct QT interval for heart rate. No single QT correction method is known to be more valid than others. QT interval was measured manually and by machine, and data from both are presented. The mean increase of heart rate associated with a 4 mg/day dose of tolterodine in this study was 2.0 beats/minute and 6.3 beats/minute with 8 mg/day tolterodine. The change in heart rate with moxifloxacin was 0.5 beats/minute. Table 2. Mean (CI) change in QTc from baseline to steady state (Day 4 of dosing) at Tmax (relative to placebo) Drug/Dose N QT c F QT c F QT c P QT c P (msec) (msec) (msec) (msec) (manual) (machine) (manual) (machine) Tolterodine 2 mg BID * 48 5.01 1.16 4.45 2.00 (0.28, 9.74) (-2.99, 5.30) (-0.37, 9.26) (-1.81, 5.81) Tolterodine 4 mg BID * 48 11.84 5.63 10.31 8.34 (7.11, 16.58) (1.48, 9.77) (5.49, 15.12) (4.53, 12.15) Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD \u2020 45 19.26 \u2021 8.90 19.10 \u2021 9.29 (15.49, 23.03) (4.77, 13.03) (15.32, 22.89) (5.34, 13.24) * At T max of 1 hr; 95% Confidence Interval. \u2020 At T max of 2 hr; 90% Confidence Interval. \u2021 The effect on QT interval with 4 days of moxifloxacin dosing in this QT trial may be greater than typically observed in QT trials of other drugs. The reason for the difference between machine and manual read of QT interval is unclear. The QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day. The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. Tolterodine\u2019s effect on QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of tolterodine. There appeared to be a greater QT c interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment in this study. This study was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between drugs or dose levels. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 ) ]."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In a study with 14 C-tolterodine solution in healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg oral dose, at least 77% of the radiolabeled dose was absorbed. C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) determined after dosage of tolterodine immediate release are dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 4 mg. Based on the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT (\u201cactive moiety\u201d), the AUC of tolterodine extended release 4 mg daily is equivalent to tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid). C max and C min levels of tolterodine extended release are about 75% and 150% of tolterodine immediate release, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations of tolterodine extended release are observed 2 to 6 hours after dose administration. Effect of Food: There is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine extended release. Distribution: Tolterodine is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Unbound concentrations of tolterodine average 3.7% \u00b1 0.13% over the concentration range achieved in clinical studies. 5-HMT is not extensively protein bound, with unbound fraction concentrations averaging 36% \u00b1 4.0%. The blood to serum ratio of tolterodine and 5-HMT averages 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that these compounds do not distribute extensively into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution of tolterodine following administration of a 1.28 mg intravenous dose is 113 \u00b1 26.7 L. Metabolism: Tolterodine is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing. The primary metabolic route involves the oxidation of the 5-methyl group and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and leads to the formation of a pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-HMT. Further metabolism leads to formation of the 5-carboxylic acid and N -dealkylated 5-carboxylic acid metabolites, which account for 51% \u00b1 14% and 29% \u00b1 6.3% of the metabolites recovered in the urine, respectively. Variability in Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 5-HMT from tolterodine. The identified pathway of metabolism for these individuals (\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d) is dealkylation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to N -dealkylated tolterodine. The remainder of the population is referred to as \u201cextensive metabolizers.\u201d Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that tolterodine is metabolized at a slower rate in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers; this results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine and in negligible concentrations of 5-HMT. Excretion: Following administration of a 5 mg oral dose of 14 C-tolterodine solution to healthy volunteers, 77% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 17% was recovered in feces in 7 days. Less than 1% (<2.5% in poor metabolizers) of the dose was recovered as intact tolterodine, and 5% to 14% (<1% in poor metabolizers) was recovered as 5-HMT. A summary of mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters of tolterodine extended release and 5-HMT in extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers is provided in Table 3. These data were obtained following single and multiple doses of tolterodine extended release administered daily to 17 healthy male volunteers (13 EM, 4 PM). Table 3.

Drug Interactions: Potent CYP2D6 inhibitors: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in C max and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT, the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine). Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: The effect of a 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean C max and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg daily [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.3 ) ]. Warfarin: In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives: Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg/levo-norgestrel 150 mcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levo-norgestrel over a 2-month period in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics: Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects. Effect of tolterodine on other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes: Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 \u00b5M), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-HMT are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes."

At the maximum tolerated dose in mice (30 mg/kg/day), female rats (20 mg/kg/day), and male rats (30 mg/kg/day), exposure margins were approximately 6 to 9 times, 7 times, and 11 times the clinical exposure to the pharmacologically active components of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules (based on AUC of tolterodine and its 5-HMT metabolite). At these exposure margins, no increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic or genotoxic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays (Ames test) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli, a gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day (about 9 to 12 times the clinical exposure via AUC), neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 2 mg were evaluated in 29 patients in a Phase 2 dose-effect study. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 4 mg were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence and frequency in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3, 12-week study. A total of 507 patients received tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, 4 mg once daily in the morning and 508 received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (81%), with a mean age of 61 years (range, 20 to 93 years). In the study, 642 patients (42%) were 65 to 93 years of age. The study included patients known to be responsive to tolterodine immediate release and other anticholinergic medications, however, 47% of patients never received prior pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder. At study entry, 97% of patients had at least 5 urge incontinence episodes per week and 91% of patients had 8 or more micturitions per day. The primary efficacy assessment was change in mean number of incontinence episodes per week at week 12 from baseline. Secondary efficacy measures included change in mean number of micturitions per day and mean volume voided per micturition at week 12 from baseline. Patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules experienced a statistically significant decrease in number of urinary incontinence per week from baseline to last assessment (week 12) compared with placebo as well as a decrease in the average daily urinary frequency and an increase in the average urine volume per void. Mean change from baseline in weekly incontinence episodes, urinary frequency, and volume voided between placebo and tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are summarized in Table 4.
