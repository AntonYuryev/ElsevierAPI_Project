The final admixed BKEMV 5 mg/mL infusion volume is 60 mL for 300 mg doses, 120 mL for 600 mg doses, 180 mL for 900 mg doses or 240 mL for 1,200 mg doses (Table 4). Table 4: Preparation and Reconstitution of BKEMV BKEMV Dose Diluent Volume Final Volume 300 mg 30 mL 60 mL 600 mg 60 mL 120 mL 900 mg 90 mL 180 mL 1,200 mg 120 mL 240 mL Gently invert the infusion bag containing the diluted BKEMV solution to ensure thorough mixing of the product and diluent. Discard any unused portion left in a vial, as the product contains no preservatives. Prior to administration, the admixture should be allowed to adjust to room temperature [18\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (64\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)]. The admixture must not be heated in a microwave or with any heat source other than ambient air temperature. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.7 Administration Only administer as an intravenous infusion. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus injection. Administer the BKEMV admixture by intravenous infusion over 35 minutes in adults and 1 to 4 hours in pediatric patients via gravity feed, a syringe-type pump, or an infusion pump. Admixed solutions of BKEMV are stable for 64 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) or 24 hours at room temperature. If an adverse reaction occurs during the administration of BKEMV, the infusion may be slowed or stopped at the discretion of the physician. If the infusion is slowed, the total infusion time should not exceed two hours in adults. Monitor the patient for at least one hour following completion of the infusion for signs or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Use caution when administering BKEMV to patients with any other systemic infection. ( 5.3 ) Infusion-Related Reactions: Monitor patients during infusion, interrupt for reactions, and institute appropriate supportive measures. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Serious Meningococcal Infections Eculizumab products, complement inhibitors, increase a patient's susceptibility to serious, life-threatening, or fatal infections caused by meningococcal bacteria (septicemia and/or meningitis) in any serogroup, including non-groupable strains. Life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients treated with complement inhibitors. The initiation of BKEMV treatment is contraindicated in patients with unresolved serious Neisseria meningitidis infection. Complete or update meningococcal vaccination (for serogroups A, C, W, Y and B) at least 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of BKEMV, according to current ACIP recommendations for patients receiving a complement inhibitor. Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations considering the duration of therapy with BKEMV. Note that ACIP recommends an administration schedule in patients receiving complement inhibitors that differs from the administration schedule in the vaccine prescribing information. If urgent BKEMV therapy is indicated in a patient who is not up to date with meningococcal vaccines according to ACIP recommendations, provide the patient with antibacterial drug prophylaxis and administer meningococcal vaccines as soon as possible. Various durations and regimens of antibacterial drug prophylaxis have been considered, but the optimal durations and drug regimens for prophylaxis and their efficacy have not been studied in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients receiving complement inhibitors, including eculizumab products. The benefits and risks of treatment with BKEMV, as well as the benefits and risks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients, must be considered against the known risks for serious infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis . Vaccination does not eliminate the risk of serious meningococcal infections, despite development of antibodies following vaccination. Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and evaluate patients immediately if infection is suspected. Inform patients of these signs and symptoms and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care if these signs and symptoms occur. Promptly treat known infections. Meningococcal infection may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Consider interruption of BKEMV in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious meningococcal infection, depending on the risks of interrupting treatment in the disease being treated. BKEMV is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 5.2 BKEMV REMS BKEMV is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called BKEMV REMS, because of the risk of serious meningococcal infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Notable requirements of the BKEMV REMS include the following: Prescribers must enroll in the REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of serious meningococcal infection. Prescribers must provide the patients with the REMS educational materials. Prescribers must assess patient vaccination status for meningococcal vaccines (against serogroups A, C, W, Y and B) and vaccinate if needed according to current ACIP recommendations 2 weeks prior to the first dose of BKEMV. Prescribers must provide a prescription for antibacterial drug prophylaxis if treatment must be started urgently and the patient is not up to date with meningococcal vaccines according to current ACIP recommendations at least two weeks prior to the first dose of BKEMV. Healthcare settings and pharmacies that dispense BKEMV must be certified in the REMS and must verify prescribers are certified. Patients must receive counseling from the prescriber about the need to receive meningococcal vaccines per ACIP recommendations, the need to take antibiotics as directed by the prescriber, and the signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection. Patients must be instructed to carry the Patient Safety Card with them at all times during and for 3 months following treatment with BKEMV. Further information is available at www.BKEMVREMS.com or 1-866-718-6927. 5.3 Other Infections Serious infections with Neisseria species (other than Neisseria meningitidis ), including disseminated gonococcal infections, have been reported. Eculizumab products block terminal complement activation; therefore, patients may have increased susceptibility to infections, especially with encapsulated bacteria, such as infections with Neisseria meningitidis but also Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , and to a lesser extent, Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Additionally, Aspergillus infections have occurred in immunocompromised and neutropenic patients. Children treated with eculizumab products may be at increased risk of developing serious infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Administer vaccinations for the prevention of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infections according to ACIP recommendations. Patients receiving eculizumab products are at increased risk for infections due to these organisms, even if they develop antibodies following vaccination. 5.4 Monitoring Disease Manifestations after BKEMV Discontinuation Treatment Discontinuation for PNH Monitor patients after discontinuing BKEMV for at least 8 weeks to detect hemolysis. Treatment Discontinuation for aHUS After discontinuing BKEMV, monitor patients with aHUS for signs and symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) complications for at least 12 weeks. In aHUS clinical trials, 18 patients (5 in the prospective studies) discontinued eculizumab treatment. TMA complications occurred following a missed dose in 5 patients, and eculizumab was reinitiated in 4 of these 5 patients. Clinical signs and symptoms of TMA include changes in mental status, seizures, angina, dyspnea, or thrombosis. In addition, the following changes in laboratory parameters may identify a TMA complication: occurrence of two, or repeated measurement of any one of the following: a decrease in platelet count by 25% or more compared to baseline or the peak platelet count during BKEMV treatment; an increase in serum creatinine by 25% or more compared to baseline or nadir during BKEMV treatment; or, an increase in serum LDH by 25% or more over baseline or nadir during BKEMV treatment. If TMA complications occur after BKEMV discontinuation, consider reinstitution of BKEMV treatment, plasma therapy [plasmapheresis, plasma exchange, or fresh frozen plasma infusion (PE/PI)], or appropriate organ-specific supportive measures. 5.5 Thrombosis Prevention and Management The effect of withdrawal of anticoagulant therapy during eculizumab products treatment has not been established. Therefore, treatment with eculizumab products should not alter anticoagulant management. 5.6 Infusion-Related Reactions Administration of eculizumab products may result in infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions. In clinical trials, no patients experienced an infusion-related reaction which required discontinuation of eculizumab. Interrupt BKEMV infusion and institute appropriate supportive measures if signs of cardiovascular instability or respiratory compromise occur."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Serious Meningococcal Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Other Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Monitoring Disease Manifestations after BKEMV Discontinuation [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Thrombosis Prevention and Management [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Infusion-Related Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the PNH randomized trial (\u226510% overall and greater than placebo) are: headache, nasopharyngitis, back pain, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) The most frequently reported adverse reactions in aHUS single arm prospective trials (\u226520%) are: headache, diarrhea, hypertension, upper respiratory infection, abdominal pain, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, anemia, cough, peripheral edema, nausea, urinary tract infections, pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) The most frequently reported adverse reaction in the gMG placebo-controlled clinical trial (\u226510%) in adult patients is musculoskeletal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amgen Medical Information at 1-800-77-AMGEN (1-800-772-6436) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Meningococcal infections are the most important adverse reactions experienced by patients receiving eculizumab. In PNH clinical studies, two patients experienced meningococcal sepsis. Both patients had previously received a meningococcal vaccine. In clinical studies among patients without PNH, meningococcal meningitis occurred in one unvaccinated patient. Meningococcal sepsis occurred in one previously vaccinated patient enrolled in the retrospective aHUS study during the post-study follow-up period [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. PNH The data described below reflect exposure to eculizumab in 196 adult patients with PNH, age 18-85, of whom 55% were female. All had signs or symptoms of intravascular hemolysis. Eculizumab was studied in a placebo-controlled clinical study (PNH Study 1, in which 43 patients received eculizumab and 44, placebo); a single arm clinical study (PNH Study 2); and a long-term extension study (E05-001). One hundred and eighty two patients were exposed for greater than one year. All patients received the recommended eculizumab dose regimen. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a numerically higher rate in the eculizumab group than the placebo group and at a rate of 5% or more among patients treated with eculizumab. Table 5: Adverse Reactions Reported in 5% or More of Eculizumab Treated Patients with PNH and Greater than Placebo in the Controlled Clinical Study Reaction Eculizumab (N = 43) N (%) Placebo (N = 44) N (%) Headache 19 (44) 12 (27) Nasopharyngitis 10 (23) 8 (18) Back pain 8 (19) 4 (9) Nausea 7 (16) 5 (11) Fatigue 5 (12) 1 (2) Cough 5 (12) 4 (9) Herpes simplex infections 3 (7) 0 Sinusitis 3 (7) 0 Respiratory tract infection 3 (7) 1 (2) Constipation 3 (7) 2 (5) Myalgia 3 (7) 1 (2) Pain in extremity 3 (7) 1 (2) Influenza-like illness 2 (5) 1 (2) In the placebo-controlled clinical study, serious adverse reactions occurred among 4 (9%) patients receiving eculizumab and 9 (21%) patients receiving placebo. The serious reactions included infections and progression of PNH. No deaths occurred in the study and no patients receiving eculizumab experienced a thrombotic event; one thrombotic event occurred in a patient receiving placebo. Among 193 patients with PNH treated with eculizumab in the single arm, clinical study or the follow-up study, the adverse reactions were similar to those reported in the placebo-controlled clinical study. Serious adverse reactions occurred among 16% of the patients in these studies. The most common serious adverse reactions were: viral infection (2%), headache (2%), anemia (2%), and pyrexia (2%). aHUS The safety of eculizumab therapy in patients with aHUS was evaluated in four prospective, single-arm studies, three in adult and adolescent patients (Studies C08-002A/B, C08-003A/B, and C10-004), one in pediatric and adolescent patients (Study C10-003), and one retrospective study (Study C09-001r). The data described below were derived from 78 adult and adolescent patients with aHUS in Studies C08-002A/B, C08-003A/B and C10-004. All patients received the recommended dosage of eculizumab. Median exposure was 67 weeks (range: 2-145 weeks). Table 6 summarizes all adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients in Studies C08-002A/B, C08-003A/B and C10-004 combined.

The most commonly reported SAEs were infections (24%), hypertension (5%), chronic renal failure (5%), and renal impairment (5%). Five patients discontinued eculizumab due to adverse events; three due to worsening renal function, one due to new diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and one due to meningococcal meningitis. Study C10-003 included 22 pediatric and adolescent patients, of which 18 patients were less than 12 years of age. All patients received the recommended dosage of eculizumab. Median exposure was 44 weeks (range: 1 dose-87 weeks). Table 7 summarizes all adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients enrolled in Study C10-003.

The most commonly reported SAEs were hypertension (9%), viral gastroenteritis (9%), pyrexia (9%), and upper respiratory infection (9%). One patient discontinued eculizumab due to an adverse event (severe agitation). Analysis of retrospectively collected adverse event data from pediatric and adult patients enrolled in Study C09-001r (N = 30) revealed a safety profile that was similar to that which was observed in the two prospective studies. Study C09-001r included 19 pediatric patients less than 18 years of age. Overall, the safety of eculizumab in pediatric patients with aHUS enrolled in Study C09-001r appeared similar to that observed in adult patients. The most common (\u226515%) adverse events occurring in pediatric patients are presented in Table 8.

Patients were 19 to 79 years of age, and 66% were female. Table 9 displays the most common adverse reactions from gMG Study 1 that occurred in \u2265 5% of eculizumab-treated patients and at a greater frequency than on placebo.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to eculizumab products exposure. Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Spontaneous Reports Fatal or serious infections: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria sicca/subflava, Neisseria spp unspecified. Cases of cholestatic or mixed pattern liver injury with increased serum liver enzymes and bilirubin levels have been reported in adult and pediatric patients with aHUS who were treated with eculizumab products. These events occurred within 3 to 27 days after starting treatment. The median time to resolution (or return to baseline) was approximately 3 weeks."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data on outcomes of pregnancies that have occurred following eculizumab use in pregnant women have not identified a concern for specific adverse developmental outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ). Animal studies using a mouse analogue of the eculizumab molecule (murine anti-C5 antibody) showed increased rates of developmental abnormalities and an increased rate of dead and moribund offspring at doses 2-8 times the human dose ( see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defect and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or fetal/neonatal risk PNH in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes, including worsening cytopenias, thrombotic events, infections, bleeding, miscarriages and increased maternal mortality, and adverse fetal outcomes, including fetal death and premature delivery. aHUS in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes, including pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery, and adverse fetal/neonatal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), fetal death and low birth weight. Data Human Data A pooled analysis of prospectively (50.3%) and retrospectively (49.7%) collected data in more than 300 pregnant women with live births following exposure to eculizumab have not suggested safety concerns. However, these data cannot definitively exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy, because of the limited sample size. Animal Data Animal reproduction studies were conducted in mice using doses of a murine anti-C5 antibody that approximated 2-4 times (low dose) and 4-8 times (high dose) the recommended human eculizumab dose, based on a body weight comparison. When animal exposure to the antibody occurred in the time period from before mating until early gestation, no decrease in fertility or reproductive performance was observed. When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred during organogenesis, two cases of retinal dysplasia and one case of umbilical hernia were observed among 230 offspring born to mothers exposed to the higher antibody dose; however, the exposure did not increase fetal loss or neonatal death. When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred in the time period from implantation through weaning, a higher number of male offspring became moribund or died (1/25 controls, 2/25 low dose group, 5/25 high dose group). Surviving offspring had normal development and reproductive function. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Although limited published data does not report detectable levels of eculizumab in human milk, maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. Available information is insufficient to inform the effect of eculizumab products on the breastfed infant. There are no data on the effects of eculizumab products on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for BKEMV and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BKEMV or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use PNH Safety and effectiveness of BKEMV for the treatment of PNH in pediatric patients have not been established. aHUS The safety and effectiveness of BKEMV for the treatment of aHUS have been established in pediatric patients. Use of BKEMV in pediatric patients for this indication is supported by evidence from four adequate and well-controlled clinical studies assessing the safety and effectiveness of eculizumab for the treatment of aHUS. The studies included a total of 47 pediatric patients (ages 2 months to 17 years). The safety and effectiveness of eculizumab for the treatment of aHUS appear similar in pediatric and adult patients [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Vaccinations Administer vaccinations for the prevention of infection due to Neisseria meningitidis , Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) according to ACIP guidelines [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.3) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Fifty-one patients 65 years of age or older (15 with PNH, 4 with aHUS, 26 with gMG, and 6 with another indication) were treated with eculizumab in clinical trials in the approved indications. Although there were no apparent age-related differences observed in these studies, the number of patients aged 65 and over is not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Eculizumab-aeeb, the active ingredient in BKEMV, is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. Eculizumab products inhibit terminal complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients and complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in patients with aHUS. The precise mechanism by which eculizumab exerts its therapeutic effect in gMG patients is unknown, but is presumed to involve reduction of terminal complement complex C5b-9 deposition at the neuromuscular junction. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In the placebo-controlled clinical study (PNH Study 1), eculizumab when administered as recommended reduced serum LDH levels from 2200 \u00b1 1034 U/L (mean \u00b1 SD) at baseline to 700 \u00b1 388 U/L by week one and maintained the effect through the end of the study at week 26 (327 \u00b1 433 U/L) in patients with PNH. In the single arm clinical study (PNH Study 2), the effect was maintained through week 52 [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In patients with PNH, aHUS, and gMG, free C5 concentrations of <0.5 mcg/mL was correlated with complete blockade of terminal complement activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous maintenance doses of 900 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with PNH, the week 26 observed mean \u00b1 SD serum eculizumab maximum concentration (C max ) was 194 \u00b1 76 mcg/mL and the trough concentration (C trough ) was 97 \u00b1 60 mcg/mL. Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1,200 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with aHUS, the week 26 observed mean \u00b1 SD C trough was 242 \u00b1 101 mcg/mL. Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1,200 mg once every 2 weeks in adult patients with gMG, the week 26 observed mean \u00b1 SD C max was 783 \u00b1 288 mcg/mL and the C trough was 341 \u00b1 172 mcg/mL. Steady state was achieved 4 weeks after starting eculizumab treatment, with accumulation ratio of approximately 2-fold in all studied indications. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that eculizumab pharmacokinetics were dose-linear and time-independent over the 600 mg to 1,200 mg dose range, with inter-individual variability of 21% to 38%. Distribution The eculizumab volume of distribution for a typical 70 kg patient was 5 L to 8 L. Elimination The half-life of eculizumab ranged between 141 hours and 882 hours. Plasma exchange or infusion increased the clearance of eculizumab by approximately 6.01-fold and reduced the half-life to 90.2 hours. Supplemental dosing is recommended when BKEMV is administered to patients receiving plasma exchange or infusion [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Specific Populations Age, Sex, and Race: The pharmacokinetics of eculizumab were not affected by age (2 months to 85 years), sex, or race. Renal Impairment: Renal function did not affect the pharmacokinetics of eculizumab in PNH (creatinine clearance of 8 mL/min to 396 mL/min calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula) or aHUS (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to 105 mL/min/1.73 m 2 using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] formula, or gMG patients (eGFR of 44 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to 168 mL/min/1.73 m 2 using MDRD formula). 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of eculizumab or of other eculizumab products. The immunogenicity of eculizumab has been evaluated using two different immunoassays for the detection of anti-eculizumab antibodies: a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the Fab fragment of eculizumab as target was used for the PNH indication; and an electro-chemiluminescence (ECL) bridging assay using the eculizumab whole molecule as target was used for the aHUS, and gMG indications, as well as for additional patients with PNH. In the PNH population, antibodies to eculizumab were detected in 3/196 (2%) patients using the ELISA assay and in 5/161 (3%) patients using the ECL assay during the entire treatment period. In the aHUS population, antibodies to eculizumab were detected in 3/100 (3%) patients using the ECL assay during the entire treatment period. In the gMG population, none of the 62 adult patients had antibodies to eculizumab detected following the 26-week active treatment. An ECL based neutralizing assay with a low sensitivity of 2 mcg/mL was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies for the 5 patients with PNH and the 3 patients with aHUS, with anti-eculizumab antibody positive samples using the ECL assay. Two of 161 patients with PNH (1.2%) and 1 of 100 patients with aHUS (1%) had low positive values for neutralizing antibodies. No apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response was observed"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) The safety and efficacy of eculizumab in PNH patients with hemolysis were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 26-week study (PNH Study 1, NCT00122330); PNH patients were also treated with eculizumab in a single arm 52-week study (PNH Study 2, NCT00122304) and in a long-term extension study (E05-001, NCT00122317). Patients received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of eculizumab. In all studies, the dose of eculizumab was 600 mg study drug every 7 \u00b1 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg 7 \u00b1 2 days later, then 900 mg every 14 \u00b1 2 days for the study duration. Eculizumab was administered as an intravenous infusion over 25 - 45 minutes. PNH Study 1: PNH patients with at least four transfusions in the prior 12 months, flow cytometric confirmation of at least 10% PNH cells and platelet counts of at least 100,000/microliter were randomized to either eculizumab (n = 43) or placebo (n = 44). Prior to randomization, all patients underwent an initial observation period to confirm the need for RBC transfusion and to identify the hemoglobin concentration (the \"set-point\") which would define each patient's hemoglobin stabilization and transfusion outcomes. The hemoglobin set-point was less than or equal to 9 g/dL in patients with symptoms and was less than or equal to 7 g/dL in patients without symptoms. Endpoints related to hemolysis included the numbers of patients achieving hemoglobin stabilization, the number of RBC units transfused, fatigue, and health-related quality of life. To achieve a designation of hemoglobin stabilization, a patient had to maintain a hemoglobin concentration above the hemoglobin set-point and avoid any RBC transfusion for the entire 26-week period. Hemolysis was monitored mainly by the measurement of serum LDH levels, and the proportion of PNH RBCs was monitored by flow cytometry. Patients receiving anticoagulants and systemic corticosteroids at baseline continued these medications. Major baseline characteristics were balanced (see Table 10 ). Table 10: PNH Study 1 Patient Baseline Characteristics Study 1 Parameter Placebo (N = 44) eculizumab (N = 43) Mean age (SD) 38 (13) 42 (16) Gender - female (%) 29 (66) 23 (54) History of aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (%) 12 (27) 8 (19) Patients with history of thrombosis (events) 8 (11) 9 (16) Concomitant anticoagulants (%) 20 (46) 24 (56) Concomitant steroids/immunosuppressant treatments (%) 16 (36) 14 (33) Packed RBC units transfused per patient in previous 12 months (median (Q1, Q3)) 17 (14, 25) 18 (12, 24) Mean Hgb level (g/dL) at setpoint (SD) 8 (1) 8 (1) Pre-treatment LDH levels (median, U/L) 2,234 2,032 Free hemoglobin at baseline (median, mg/dL) 46 41 Patients treated with eculizumab had significantly reduced (p< 0.001) hemolysis resulting in improvements in anemia as indicated by increased hemoglobin stabilization and reduced need for RBC transfusions compared to placebo treated patients (see Table 11 ). These effects were seen among patients within each of the three pre-study RBC transfusion strata (4 - 14 units; 15 - 25 units; >25 units). After 3 weeks of eculizumab treatment, patients reported less fatigue and improved health-related quality of life. Because of the study sample size and duration, the effects of eculizumab products on thrombotic events could not be determined.

Concomitant medications included anti-thrombotic agents in 63% of the patients and systemic corticosteroids in 40% of the patients. Overall, 96 of the 97 enrolled patients completed the study (one patient died following a thrombotic event). A reduction in intravascular hemolysis as measured by serum LDH levels was sustained for the treatment period and resulted in a reduced need for RBC transfusion and less fatigue. One hundred and eighty-seven eculizumab-treated PNH patients were enrolled in a long-term extension study. All patients sustained a reduction in intravascular hemolysis over a total eculizumab exposure time ranging from 10 to 54 months. There were fewer thrombotic events with eculizumab treatment than during the same period of time prior to treatment. However, the majority of patients received concomitant anticoagulants; the effects of anticoagulant withdrawal during eculizumab products therapy was not studied [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 14.2 Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) Five single-arm studies [four prospective: C08-002A/B (NCT00844545 and NCT00844844), C08-003A/B (NCT00838513 and NCT00844428), C10-003 (NCT01193348), and C10-004 (NCT01194973); and one retrospective: C09-001r (NCT01770951)] evaluated the safety and efficacy of eculizumab for the treatment of aHUS. Patients with aHUS received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of eculizumab or received prophylactic treatment with antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. In all studies, the dose of eculizumab in adult and adolescent patients was 900 mg every 7 \u00b1 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 1,200 mg 7 \u00b1 2 days later, then 1,200 mg every 14 \u00b1 2 days thereafter. The dosage regimen for pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg enrolled in Study C09-001r and Study C10-003 was based on body weight [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Efficacy evaluations were based on thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) endpoints. Endpoints related to TMA included the following: platelet count change from baseline hematologic normalization (maintenance of normal platelet counts and LDH levels for at least four weeks) complete TMA response (hematologic normalization plus at least a 25% reduction in serum creatinine for a minimum of four weeks) TMA-event free status (absence for at least 12 weeks of a decrease in platelet count of >25% from baseline, plasma exchange or plasma infusion, and new dialysis requirement) Daily TMA intervention rate (defined as the number of plasma exchange or plasma infusion interventions and the number of new dialyses required per patient per day). aHUS Resistant to PE/PI (Study C08-002A/B) Study C08-002A/B enrolled patients who displayed signs of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) despite receiving at least four PE/PI treatments the week prior to screening. One patient had no PE/PI the week prior to screening because of PE/PI intolerance. In order to qualify for enrollment, patients were required to have a platelet count \u2264150 \u00d7 10 9 /L, evidence of hemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH, and serum creatinine above the upper limits of normal, without the need for chronic dialysis. The median patient age was 28 (range: 17 to 68 years). Patients enrolled in Study C08-002A/B were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed range of values in the trial were 70%-121%. Seventy-six percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. Table 12 summarizes the key baseline clinical and disease-related characteristics of patients enrolled in Study C08-002A/B. Table 12: Baseline Characteristics of Patients Enrolled in Study C08-002A/B Parameter C08-002A/B (N = 17) Time from aHUS diagnosis until screening in months, median (min, max) 10 (0.26, 236) Time from current clinical TMA manifestation until screening in months, median (min, max) <1 (<1, 4) Baseline platelet count (\u00d7 10 9 /L), median (range) 118 (62, 161) Baseline LDH (U/L), median (range) 269 (134, 634) Patients in Study C08-002A/B received eculizumab for a minimum of 26 weeks. In Study C08-002A/B, the median duration of eculizumab therapy was approximately 100 weeks (range: 2 weeks to 145 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved and maintained during eculizumab therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) increased from 23 \u00b1 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at baseline to 56 \u00b1 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2 by 26 weeks; this effect was maintained through 2 years (56 \u00b1 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Four of the five patients who required dialysis at baseline were able to discontinue dialysis. Reduction in terminal complement activity and an increase in platelet count relative to baseline were observed after commencement of eculizumab. Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. In Study C08-002A/B, mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 109 \u00b1 32 \u00d7 10 9 /L at baseline to 169 \u00b1 72 \u00d7 10 9 /L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (210 \u00b1 68 \u00d7 10 9 /L), and 2 years (205 \u00b1 46 \u00d7 10 9 /L). When treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, two additional patients achieved Hematologic Normalization as well as Complete TMA response. Hematologic Normalization and Complete TMA response were maintained by all responders. In Study C08-002A/B, responses to eculizumab were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins.

All patients had received PT at least once every two weeks, but no more than three times per week, for a minimum of eight weeks prior to the first eculizumab dose. Patients on chronic dialysis were permitted to enroll in Study C08-003A/B. The median patient age was 28 years (range: 13 to 63 years). Patients enrolled in Study C08003A/B were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed-range of values in the trial were 37%-118%. Seventy percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. Table 14 summarizes the key baseline clinical and disease related- characteristics of patients enrolled in Study C08-003A/B.

In Study C08-003A/B, the median duration of eculizumab therapy was approximately 114 weeks (range: 26 to 129 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was maintained during eculizumab therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) was 31 \u00b1 19 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at baseline, and was maintained through 26 weeks (37 \u00b1 21 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and 2 years (40 \u00b1 18 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). No patient required new dialysis with eculizumab. Reduction in terminal complement activity was observed in all patients after the commencement of eculizumab. Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. Platelet counts were maintained at normal levels despite the elimination of PE/PI. The mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) was 228 \u00b1 78 \u00d7 10 9 /L at baseline, 233 \u00b1 69 \u00d7 10 9 /L at week 26, and 224 \u00b1 52 \u00d7 10 9 /L at 2 years. When treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, six additional patients achieved Complete TMA response. Complete TMA Response and Hematologic Normalization were maintained by all responders. In Study C08-003A/B, responses to eculizumab were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins. Table 15 summarizes the efficacy results for Study C08-003A/B. Table 15: Efficacy Results for Study C08-003A/B Efficacy Parameter Study C08-003A/B at 26 wks At data cut-off (September 8, 2010).

Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline. Mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 171 \u00b1 83 \u00d7 10 9 /L at baseline to 233 \u00b110 9 \u00d7 10 9 /L after one week of therapy; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) at week 26: 254 \u00b1 79 \u00d7 10 9 /L). A total of 19 pediatric patients (ages 2 months to 17 years) received eculizumab in Study C09-001r. The median duration of eculizumab therapy was 16 weeks (range 4 to 70 weeks) for children < 2 years of age (n = 5), 31 weeks (range 19 to 63 weeks) for children 2 to <12 years of age (n = 10), and 38 weeks (range 1 to 69 weeks) for patients 12 to < 18 years of age (n = 4). Fifty-three percent of pediatric patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. Overall, the efficacy results for these pediatric patients appeared consistent with what was observed in patients enrolled in Studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B (Table 16). No pediatric patient required new dialysis during treatment with eculizumab.

In order to qualify for enrollment, patients were required to have a platelet count < lower limit of normal range (LLN), evidence of hemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH, and serum creatinine above the upper limits of normal, without the need for chronic dialysis. The median patient age was 35 (range: 18 to 80 years). All patients enrolled in Study C10-004 were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed range of values in the trial were 28%-116%. Fifty-one percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. A total of 35 patients received PE/PI prior to eculizumab. Table 17 summarizes the key baseline clinical and disease-related characteristics of patients enrolled in Study C10-004.

In Study C10-004, the median duration of eculizumab therapy was approximately 50 weeks (range: 13 weeks to 86 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved during eculizumab therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) increased from 17 \u00b1 12 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at baseline to 47 \u00b1 24 mL/min/1.73 m 2 by 26 weeks. Twenty of the 24 patients who required dialysis at study baseline were able to discontinue dialysis during eculizumab treatment. Reduction in terminal complement activity and an increase in platelet count relative to baseline were observed after commencement of eculizumab. Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. In Study C10-004, mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 119 \u00b1 66 \u00d7 10 9 /L at baseline to 200 \u00b1 84 \u00d7 10 9 /L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) at week 26: 252 \u00b1 70 \u00d7 10 9 /L). In Study C10-004, responses to eculizumab were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins or auto-antibodies to factor H.

The median patient age was 6.5 (range: 5 months to 17 years). Patients enrolled in Study C10-003 were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed range of values in the trial were 38%-121%. Fifty percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. A total of 10 patients received PE/PI prior to eculizumab. Table 19 summarizes the key baseline clinical and disease-related characteristics of patients enrolled in Study C10-003.

In Study C10-003, the median duration of eculizumab therapy was approximately 44 weeks (range: 1 dose to 88 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved during eculizumab therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) increased from 33 \u00b1 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at baseline to 98 \u00b1 44 mL/min/1.73 m 2 by 26 weeks. Among the 20 patients with a CKD stage \u22652 at baseline, 17 (85%) achieved a CKD improvement of \u22651 stage. Among the 16 patients ages 1 month to <12 years with a CKD stage \u22652 at baseline, 14 (88%) achieved a CKD improvement by \u22651 stage. Nine of the 11 patients who required dialysis at study baseline were able to discontinue dialysis during eculizumab treatment. Responses were observed across all ages from 5 months to 17 years of age. Reduction in terminal complement activity was observed in all patients after commencement of eculizumab. Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. The mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 88 \u00b1 42 \u00d7 10 9 /L at baseline to 281 \u00b1 123 \u00d7 10 9 /L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (\u00b1SD) at week 26: 293 \u00b1 106 \u00d7 10 9 /L). In Study C10-003, responses to eculizumab were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins or auto-antibodies to factor H.

A total of 62 patients were randomized to receive eculizumab treatment and 63 were randomized to receive placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups, including age at diagnosis (38 years in each group), gender [66% female (eculizumab) versus 65% female (placebo)], and duration of gMG [9.9 (eculizumab) versus 9.2 (placebo) years]. Over 95% of patients in each group were receiving acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, and 98% were receiving immunosuppressant therapies (ISTs). Approximately 50% of each group had been previously treated with at least 3 ISTs. Eculizumab was administered according to the recommended dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . The primary efficacy endpoint for Study ECU-MG-301 was a comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the Myasthenia Gravis-Specific Activities of Daily Living scale (MG-ADL) total score at Week 26. The MG-ADL is a categorical scale that assesses the impact on daily function of 8 signs or symptoms that are typically affected in gMG. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents normal function and a score of 3 represents loss of ability to perform that function (total score 0-24). A statistically significant difference favoring eculizumab was observed in the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in MG-ADL total scores [-4.2 points in the eculizumab-treated group compared with -2.3 points in the placebo-treated group (p = 0.006)]. A key secondary endpoint in Study ECU-MG-301 was the change from baseline in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) total score at Week 26. The QMG is a 13-item categorical scale assessing muscle weakness. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents no weakness and a score of 3 represents severe weakness (total score 0-39). A statistically significant difference favoring eculizumab was observed in the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in QMG total scores [-4.6 points in the eculizumab-treated group compared with -1.6 points in the placebo-treated group (p = 0.001)]. The results of the analysis of the MG-ADL and QMG from Study ECU-MG-301 are shown in Table 21. Table 21: Analysis of Change from Baseline to Week 26 in MG-ADL and QMG Total Scores in Study ECU-MG-301 Efficacy Endpoints Eculizumab-LS Mean (N = 62) Placebo-LS Mean (N = 63) Eculizumab change relative to placebo \u2013 LS Mean Difference p-values (SEM) (SEM) (95% CI) SEM= Standard Error of the Mean; Eculizumab-LSMean = least square mean for the treatment group; Placebo-LSMean = least square mean for the placebo group; LSMean-Difference (95% CI) = Difference in least square mean with 95% confidence interval; p-values (testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two treatment arms MG-ADL \u22124.2 (0.49) \u22122.3 (0.48) \u22121.9 (-3.3, \u22120.6) (0.006 in least square means at Week 26 using a repeated measure analysis; , 0.014 in ranks at Week 26 using a worst rank analysis) ) QMG \u22124.6 (0.60) \u22121.6 (0.59) \u22123.0 (-4.6, \u22121.3) (0.001 , 0.005 ) In Study ECU-MG-301, a clinical response was defined in the MG-ADL total score as at least a 3-point improvement and in QMG total score as at least a 5-point improvement. The proportion of clinical responders at Week 26 with no rescue therapy was statistically significantly higher for eculizumab compared to placebo for both measures. For both endpoints, and also at higher response thresholds (\u2265 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, or 8-point improvement on MG-ADL, and \u2265 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, or 10-point improvement on QMG), the proportion of clinical responders was consistently greater for eculizumab compared to placebo. Available data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved by 12 weeks of eculizumab treatment."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patients and/or caregivers to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Serious Meningococcal Infections Advise patients of the risk of serious meningococcal infection. Inform patients of the need to complete or update their meningococcal vaccinations at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of BKEMV or receive antibacterial drug prophylaxis if BKEMV treatment must be initiated immediately and they have not been previously vaccinated. Inform patients of the requirement to be revaccinated according to current ACIP recommendations for meningococcal infection while on BKEMV therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Inform patients that vaccination may not prevent serious meningococcal infection and to seek immediate medical attention if the following signs or symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] : fever fever and a rash fever with high heart rate headache with nausea or vomiting headache and a fever headache with a stiff neck or stiff back confusion muscle aches with flu-like symptoms eyes sensitive to light Inform patients that they will be given a Patient Safety Card for BKEMV that they should carry with them at all times during and for 3 months following treatment with BKEMV. This card describes symptoms which, if experienced, should prompt the patient to immediately seek medical evaluation. BKEMV REMS BKEMV is available only through a restricted program called BKEMV REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Inform the patient of the following notable requirements: Patients must receive counseling about the risk of serious meningococcal infections. Patients must receive written educational materials about this risk. Patients must be instructed to carry the Patient Safety Card with them at all times during and for 3 months following treatment with BKEMV. Patients must be instructed to complete or update meningococcal vaccines for serogroups A, C, W, Y and B per ACIP recommendations as directed by the prescriber prior to treatment with BKEMV. Patients must receive antibiotics as directed by the prescriber if they are not up to date with meningococcal vaccines and have to start BKEMV right away. Other Infections Counsel patients about gonorrhea prevention and advise regular testing for patients at-risk. Inform patients that there may be an increased risk of other types of infections, particularly those due to encapsulated bacteria. Aspergillus infections have occurred in immunocompromised and neutropenic patients. Inform parents or caregivers of children receiving BKEMV for the treatment of aHUS that their child should be vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) according to current medical guidelines. Infusion-Related Reactions Advise patients that administration of BKEMV may result in infusion-related reactions. Discontinuation Inform patients with PNH that they may develop serious hemolysis due to PNH when BKEMV is discontinued and that they will be monitored by their healthcare professional for at least 8 weeks following BKEMV discontinuation. Inform patients with aHUS that there is a potential for TMA complications due to aHUS when BKEMV is discontinued and that they will be monitored by their healthcare professional for at least 12 weeks following BKEMV discontinuation. Inform patients who discontinue BKEMV to keep the Patient Safety Card with them for three months after the last BKEMV dose, because the increased risk of meningococcal infection persists for several weeks following discontinuation of BKEMV."

Revised 11/2025 MEDICATION GUIDE BKEMV \u00ae (bee-KEM-vee) (eculizumab-aeeb) injection, for intravenous use What is the most important information I should know about BKEMV? BKEMV is a medicine that affects your immune system. BKEMV may lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. BKEMV increases your chance of getting serious meningococcal infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis bacteria.

Transfer the recommended dose to an infusion bag. Dilute EPYSQLI to a final concentration of 5 mg/mL by adding the appropriate amount (equal volume of diluent to drug volume) of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; or 5% Dextrose in Water Injection, USP to the infusion bag. The final admixed EPYSQLI 5 mg/mL infusion volume is 60 mL for 300 mg doses, 120 mL for 600 mg doses, 180 mL for 900 mg doses or 240 mL for 1,200 mg doses (Table 4). Table 4: Preparation and Reconstitution of EPYSQLI EPYSQLI Dose Diluent Volume Final Volume 300 mg 30 mL 60 mL 600 mg 60 mL 120 mL 900 mg 90 mL 180 mL 1,200 mg 120 mL 240 mL Gently invert the infusion bag containing the diluted EPYSQLI solution to ensure thorough mixing of the product and diluent. Discard any unused portion left in a vial, as the product contains no preservatives. Prior to administration, the admixture should be allowed to adjust to room temperature [18\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (64\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)]. The admixture must not be heated in a microwave or with any heat source other than ambient air temperature. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.7 Administration Only administer as an intravenous infusion. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus injection. Administer the EPYSQLI admixture by intravenous infusion over 35 minutes in adults and 1 to 4 hours in pediatric patients via gravity feed, a syringe-type pump, or an infusion pump. Admixed solutions of EPYSQLI are stable for 24 hours refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) and at room temperature. If an adverse reaction occurs during the administration of EPYSQLI, the infusion may be slowed or stopped at the discretion of the physician. If the infusion is slowed, the total infusion time should not exceed two hours in adults. Monitor the patient for at least one hour following completion of the infusion for signs or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Use caution when administering EPYSQLI to patients with any other systemic infection. ( 5.3 ) Infusion-Related Reactions: Monitor patients during infusion, interrupt for reactions, and institute appropriate supportive measures. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Serious Meningococcal Infections Eculizumab products, complement inhibitors, increase a patient's susceptibility to serious, life-threatening, or fatal infections caused by meningococcal bacteria (septicemia and/or meningitis) in any serogroup, including non-groupable strains. Life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients treated with complement inhibitors. . The initiation of EPYSQLI treatment is contraindicated in patients with unresolved serious Neisseria meningitidis infection. Complete or update meningococcal vaccination (for serogroups A, C, W, Y, and B) at least 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of EPYSQLI, according to current ACIP recommendations for patients receiving a complement inhibitor. Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations, considering the duration of therapy with EPYSQLI. Note that ACIP recommends an administration schedule in patients receiving complement inhibitors that differs from the administration schedule in the vaccine prescribing information. If urgent EPYSQLI therapy is indicated in a patient who is not up to date with meningococcal vaccines according to ACIP recommendations, provide the patient with antibacterial drug prophylaxis and administer meningococcal vaccines as soon as possible. Various durations and regimens of antibacterial drug prophylaxis have been considered, but the optimal durations and drug regimens for prophylaxis and their efficacy have not been studied in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients receiving complement inhibitors, including eculizumab products. The benefits and risks of treatment with EPYSQLI, as well as the benefits and risks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients, must be considered against the known risks for serious infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis . Vaccination does not eliminate the risk of serious meningococcal infections, despite development of antibodies following vaccination. Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and evaluate patients immediately if infection is suspected. Inform patients of these signs and symptoms and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care if these signs and symptoms occur. Promptly treat known infections. Meningococcal infection may become rapidly life- threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Consider interruption of EPYSQLI in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious meningococcal infection, depending on the risks of interrupting treatment in the disease being treated. EPYSQLI is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 5.2 EPYSQLI REMS EPYSQLI is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called EPYSQLI REMS, because of the risk of serious meningococcal infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Notable requirements of the EPYSQLI REMS include the following: Prescribers must enroll in the REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of serious meningococcal infection. Prescribers must provide the patients with the REMS educational materials. Prescribers must assess patient vaccination status for meningococcal vaccines (against serogroups A, C, W, Y and B) and vaccinate if needed according to current ACIP recommendations two weeks prior to the first dose of EPYSQLI. Prescribers must provide a prescription for antibacterial drug prophylaxis if treatment must be started urgently and the patient is not up to date with meningococcal vaccines according to current ACIP recommendations at least two weeks prior to the first dose of EPYSQLI. Healthcare settings and pharmacies that dispense EPYSQLI must be certified in the REMS and must verify prescribers are certified. Patients must receive counseling from the prescriber about the need to receive meningococcal vaccines per ACIP recommendations, the need to take antibiotics as directed by the prescriber, and the signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection. Patients must be instructed to carry the Patient Safety Card with them at all times during and for 3 months following treatment with EPYSQLI. Further information is available at www.EPYSQLIREMS.com or 1-866-318-0342. 5.3 Other Infections Serious infections with Neisseria species (other than Neisseria meningitidis ), including disseminated gonococcal infections, have been reported. Eculizumab products block terminal complement activation; therefore, patients may have increased susceptibility to infections, especially with encapsulated bacteria, such as infections with Neisseria meningitidis but also Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , and to a lesser extent, Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Additionally, Aspergillus infections have occurred in immunocompromised and neutropenic patients. Children treated with eculizumab products may be at increased risk of developing serious infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Administer vaccinations for the prevention of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infections according to ACIP recommendations. Patients receiving eculizumab products are at increased risk for infections due to these organisms, even if they develop antibodies following vaccination. 5.4 Monitoring Disease Manifestations after EPYSQLI Discontinuation Treatment Discontinuation for PNH Monitor patients after discontinuing EPYSQLI for at least 8 weeks to detect hemolysis. Treatment Discontinuation for aHUS After discontinuing EPYSQLI, monitor patients with aHUS for signs and symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) complications for at least 12 weeks. In aHUS clinical trials, 18 patients (5 in the prospective studies) discontinued eculizumab treatment. TMA complications occurred following a missed dose in 5 patients, and eculizumab was reinitiated in 4 of these 5 patients. Clinical signs and symptoms of TMA include changes in mental status, seizures, angina, dyspnea, or thrombosis. In addition, the following changes in laboratory parameters may identify a TMA complication: occurrence of two, or repeated measurement of any one of the following: a decrease in platelet count by 25% or more compared to baseline or the peak platelet count during EPYSQLI treatment; an increase in serum creatinine by 25% or more compared to baseline or nadir during EPYSQLI treatment; or, an increase in serum LDH by 25% or more over baseline or nadir during EPYSQLI treatment. If TMA complications occur after EPYSQLI discontinuation, consider reinstitution of EPYSQLI treatment, plasma therapy [plasmapheresis, plasma exchange, or fresh frozen plasma infusion (PE/PI)], or appropriate organ-specific supportive measures. 5.5 Thrombosis Prevention and Management The effect of withdrawal of anticoagulant therapy during eculizumab products treatment has not been established. Therefore, treatment with eculizumab products should not alter anticoagulant management. 5.6 Infusion-Related Reactions Administration of eculizumab products may result in infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions. In clinical trials, no patients experienced an infusion-related reaction which required discontinuation of eculizumab. Interrupt EPYSQLI infusion and institute appropriate supportive measures if signs of cardiovascular instability or respiratory compromise occur."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Serious Meningococcal Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Other Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Monitoring Disease Manifestations after EPYSQLI Discontinuation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Thrombosis Prevention and Management [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] Infusion-Related Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the PNH randomized trial (\u226510% overall and greater than placebo) are: headache, nasopharyngitis, back pain, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) The most frequently reported adverse reactions in aHUS single arm prospective trials (\u226520%) are: headache, diarrhea, hypertension, upper respiratory infection, abdominal pain, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, anemia, cough, peripheral edema, nausea, urinary tract infections, pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) The most frequently reported adverse reaction in the gMG placebo-controlled clinical trial (\u226510%) in adult patients is musculoskeletal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-483-8279 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Meningococcal infections are the most important adverse reactions experienced by patients receiving eculizumab. In PNH clinical studies, two patients experienced meningococcal sepsis. Both patients had previously received a meningococcal vaccine. In clinical studies among patients without PNH, meningococcal meningitis occurred in one unvaccinated patient. Meningococcal sepsis occurred in one previously vaccinated patient enrolled in the retrospective aHUS study during the post-study follow-up period [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. PNH The data described below reflect exposure to eculizumab in 196 adult patients with PNH, age 18-85, of whom 55% were female. All had signs or symptoms of intravascular hemolysis. Eculizumab was studied in a placebo-controlled clinical study (PNH Study 1, in which 43 patients received eculizumab and 44, placebo); a single arm clinical study (PNH Study 2); and a long term extension study (E05-001). 182 patients were exposed for greater than one year. All patients received the recommended eculizumab dose regimen. Table 4 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a numerically higher rate in the eculizumab group than the placebo group and at a rate of 5% or more among patients treated with eculizumab. Table 5: Adverse Reactions Reported in 5% or More of Eculizumab Treated Patients with PNH and Greater than Placebo in the Controlled Clinical Study Reaction Eculizumab Placebo (N=43) (N=44) N (%) N (%) Headache 19 (44) 12 (27) Nasopharyngitis 10 (23) 8 (18) Back pain 8 (19) 4 (9) Nausea 7 (16) 5 (11) Fatigue 5 (12) 1 (2) Cough 5 (12) 4 (9) Herpes simplex infections 3 (7) 0 Sinusitis 3 (7) 0 Respiratory tract infection 3 (7) 1 (2) Constipation 3 (7) 2 (5) Myalgia 3 (7) 1 (2) Pain in extremity 3 (7) 1 (2) Influenza-like illness 2 (5) 1 (2) In the placebo-controlled clinical study, serious adverse reactions occurred among 4 (9%) patients receiving eculizumab and 9 (21%) patients receiving placebo. The serious reactions included infections and progression of PNH. No deaths occurred in the study and no patients receiving eculizumab experienced a thrombotic event; one thrombotic event occurred in a patient receiving placebo. Among 193 patients with PNH treated with eculizumab in the single arm, clinical study or the follow-up study, the adverse reactions were similar to those reported in the placebo-controlled clinical study. Serious adverse reactions occurred among 16% of the patients in these studies. The most common serious adverse reactions were: viral infection (2%), headache (2%), anemia (2%), and pyrexia (2%). aHUS The safety of eculizumab therapy in patients with aHUS was evaluated in four prospective, single-arm studies, three in adult and adolescent patients (Studies C08-002A/B, C08-003A/B, and C10-004), one in pediatric and adolescent patients (Study C10-003), and one retrospective study (Study C09-001r). The data described below were derived from 78 adult and adolescent patients with aHUS in Studies C08-002A/B, C08-003A/B and C10-004. All patients received the recommended dosage of eculizumab.

The most commonly reported SAEs were infections (24%), hypertension (5%), chronic renal failure (5%), and renal impairment (5%). Five patients discontinued eculizumab due to adverse events; three due to worsening renal function, one due to new diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and one due to meningococcal meningitis. Study C10-003 included 22 pediatric and adolescent patients, of which 18 patients were less than 12 years of age. All patients received the recommended dosage of eculizumab. Median exposure was 44 weeks (range: 1 dose-87 weeks). Table 6 summarizes all adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients enrolled in Study C10-003.

The most commonly reported SAEs were hypertension (9%), viral gastroenteritis (9%), pyrexia (9%), and upper respiratory infection (9%). One patient discontinued eculizumab due to an adverse event (severe agitation). Analysis of retrospectively collected adverse event data from pediatric and adult patients enrolled in Study C09-001r (N=30) revealed a safety profile that was similar to that which was observed in the two prospective studies. Study C09-001r included 19 pediatric patients less than 18 years of age. Overall, the safety of eculizumab in pediatric patients with aHUS enrolled in Study C09-001r appeared similar to that observed in adult patients. The most common (\u226515%) adverse events occurring in pediatric patients are presented in Table 8.

Patients were 19 to 79 years of age, and 66% were female. Table 9 displays the most common adverse reactions from gMG Study 1 that occurred in \u22655% of eculizumab-treated patients and at a greater frequency than on placebo.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to eculizumab products exposure. Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Spontaneous Reports Fatal or serious infections: Neisseria gonorrhoeae , Neisseria meningitidis , Neisseria sicca/subflava , Neisseria spp unspecified. Cases of cholestatic or mixed pattern liver injury with increased serum liver enzymes and bilirubin levels have been reported in adult and pediatric patients with aHUS who were treated with eculizumab products. These events occurred within 3 to 27 days after starting treatment. The median time to resolution (or return to baseline) was approximately 3 weeks."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data on outcomes of pregnancies that have occurred following eculizumab use in pregnant women have not identified a concern for specific adverse developmental outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ). Animal studies using a mouse analogue of the eculizumab molecule (murine anti-C5 antibody) showed increased rates of developmental abnormalities and an increased rate of dead and moribund offspring at doses 2-8 times the human dose ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defect and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Fetal/Neonatal Risk PNH in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes, including worsening cytopenias, thrombotic events, infections, bleeding, miscarriages and increased maternal mortality, and adverse fetal outcomes, including fetal death and premature delivery. aHUS in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes, including pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery, and adverse fetal/neonatal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), fetal death and low birth weight. Data Human Data A pooled analysis of prospectively (50.3%) and retrospectively (49.7%) collected data in more than 300 pregnant women with live births following exposure to eculizumab have not suggested safety concerns. However, these data cannot definitively exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy, because of the limited sample size. Animal Data Animal reproduction studies were conducted in mice using doses of a murine anti-C5 antibody that approximated 2-4 times (low dose) and 4-8 times (high dose) the recommended human eculizumab dose, based on a body weight comparison. When animal exposure to the antibody occurred in the time period from before mating until early gestation, no decrease in fertility or reproductive performance was observed. When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred during organogenesis, two cases of retinal dysplasia and one case of umbilical hernia were observed among 230 offspring born to mothers exposed to the higher antibody dose; however, the exposure did not increase fetal loss or neonatal death. When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred in the time period from implantation through weaning, a higher number of male offspring became moribund or died (1/25 controls, 2/25 low dose group, 5/25 high dose group). Surviving offspring had normal development and reproductive function. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Although limited published data does not report detectable levels of eculizumab in human milk, maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. Available information is insufficient to inform the effect of eculizumab products on the breastfed infant. There are no data on the effects of eculizumab products on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for EPYSQLI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from EPYSQLI or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use PNH Safety and effectiveness of EPYSQLI for the treatment of PNH in pediatric patients have not been established. aHUS The safety and effectiveness of EPYSQLI for the treatment of aHUS have been established in pediatric patients. Use of EPYSQLI in pediatric patients for this indication is supported by evidence from four adequate and well-controlled clinical studies assessing the safety and effectiveness of eculizumab for the treatment of aHUS. The studies included a total of 47 pediatric patients (ages 2 months to 17 years). The safety and effectiveness of eculizumab for the treatment of aHUS appear similar in pediatric and adult patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. A pediatric assessment for EPYSQLI demonstrates that EPYSQLI is safe and effective for pediatric patients in an indication for which Soliris (eculizumab) is approved. However, EPYSQLI is not approved for such indication due to marketing exclusivity for Soliris (eculizumab). Vaccinations Administer vaccinations for the prevention of infection due to Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) according to ACIP guidelines [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.3 ) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Fifty-one patients 65 years of age or older (15 with PNH, 4 with aHUS, 26 with gMG, and 6 with another indication) were treated with eculizumab in clinical trials in the approved indications. Although there were no apparent age-related differences observed in these studies, the number of patients aged 65 and over is not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Eculizumab-aagh, the active ingredient in EPYSQLI, is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. Eculizumab products inhibit terminal complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients and complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in patients with aHUS. The precise mechanism by which eculizumab exerts its therapeutic effect in gMG patients is unknown, but is presumed to involve reduction of terminal complement complex C5b-9 deposition at the neuromuscular junction. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In the placebo-controlled clinical study (PNH Study 1), eculizumab when administered as recommended reduced serum LDH levels from 2200 \u00b1 1034 U/L (mean \u00b1 SD) at baseline to 700 \u00b1 388 U/L by week one and maintained the effect through the end of the study at week 26 (327 \u00b1 433 U/L) in patients with PNH. In the single arm clinical study (PNH Study 2), the effect was maintained through week 52 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ]. In patients with PNH, aHUS, and gMG, free C5 concentrations of < 0.5 mcg/mL was correlated with complete blockade of terminal complement activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous maintenance doses of 900 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with PNH, the week 26 observed mean \u00b1 SD serum eculizumab maximum concentration (C max ) was 194 \u00b1 76 mcg/mL and the trough concentration (C trough ) was 97 \u00b1 60 mcg/mL. Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1,200 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with aHUS, the week 26 observed mean \u00b1 SD C trough was 242 \u00b1 101 mcg/mL. Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1,200 mg once every 2 weeks in adult patients with gMG, the week 26 observed mean \u00b1 SD Cmax was 783 \u00b1 288 mcg/mL and the Ctrough was 341 \u00b1 172 mcg/mL. Steady state was achieved 4 weeks after starting eculizumab treatment, with accumulation ratio of approximately 2-fold in all studied indications. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that eculizumab pharmacokinetics were dose-linear and time-independent over the 600 mg to 1,200 mg dose range, with inter-individual variability of 21% to 38%. Distribution The eculizumab volume of distribution for a typical 70 kg patient was 5 L to 8 L. Elimination The half-life of eculizumab ranged between 141 h to 882 h. Plasma exchange or infusion increased the clearance of eculizumab by approximately 6.01-fold and reduced the half-life to 90.2 h. Supplemental dosing is recommended when EPYSQLI is administered to patients receiving plasma exchange or infusion [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ]. Specific Populations Age, Sex, and Race: The pharmacokinetics of eculizumab were not affected by age (2 months to 85 years), sex, or race. Renal Impairment: Renal function did not affect the pharmacokinetics of eculizumab in PNH (creatinine clearance of 8 mL/min to 396 mL/min calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula), aHUS (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to105 mL/min/1.73 m 2 using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] formula), or gMG patients (eGFR of 44 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to 168 mL/min/1.73 m 2 using MDRD formula). 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of eculizumab or of other eculizumab products. The immunogenicity of eculizumab has been evaluated using two different immunoassays for the detection of anti-eculizumab antibodies: a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the Fab fragment of eculizumab as target was used for the PNH indication; and an electro-chemiluminescence (ECL) bridging assay using the eculizumab whole molecule as target was used for the aHUS and gMG indications, as well as for additional patients with PNH. In the PNH population, antibodies to eculizumab were detected in 3/196 (2%) patients using the ELISA assay and in 5/161 (3%) patients using the ECL assay during the entire treatment period. In the aHUS population, antibodies to eculizumab were detected in 3/100 (3%) patients using the ECL assay during the entire treatment period. In the gMG population, none of the 62 adult patients had antibodies to eculizumab detected following the 26-week active treatment. An ECL based neutralizing assay with a low sensitivity of 2 mcg/mL was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies for the 5 patients with PNH and the 3 patients with aHUS with anti-eculizumab antibody positive samples using the ECL assay. Two of 161 patients with PNH (1.2%) and 1 of 100 patients with aHUS (1%) had low positive values for neutralizing antibodies. No apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response was observed."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) The safety and efficacy of eculizumab in PNH patients with hemolysis were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 26 week study (PNH Study 1, NCT00122330); PNH patients were also treated with eculizumab in a single arm 52 week study (PNH Study 2, NCT00122304) and in a long- term extension study (E05-001, NCT00122317). Patients received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of eculizumab. In all studies, the dose of eculizumab was 600 mg study drug every 7 \u00b1 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg 7 \u00b1 2 days later, then 900 mg every 14 \u00b1 2 days for the study duration. Eculizumab was administered as an intravenous infusion over 25 - 45 minutes. PNH Study 1: PNH patients with at least four transfusions in the prior 12 months, flow cytometric confirmation of at least 10% PNH cells and platelet counts of at least 100,000/microliter were randomized to either eculizumab (n = 43) or placebo (n = 44). Prior to randomization, all patients underwent an initial observation period to confirm the need for RBC transfusion and to identify the hemoglobin concentration (the \"set-point\") which would define each patient's hemoglobin stabilization and transfusion outcomes. The hemoglobin set-point was less than or equal to 9 g/dL in patients with symptoms and was less than or equal to 7 g/dL in patients without symptoms. Endpoints related to hemolysis included the numbers of patients achieving hemoglobin stabilization, the number of RBC units transfused, fatigue, and health-related quality of life. To achieve a designation of hemoglobin stabilization, a patient had to maintain a hemoglobin concentration above the hemoglobin set-point and avoid any RBC transfusion for the entire 26 week period. Hemolysis was monitored mainly by the measurement of serum LDH levels, and the proportion of PNH RBCs was monitored by flow cytometry. Patients receiving anticoagulants and systemic corticosteroids at baseline continued these medications. Major baseline characteristics were balanced (see Table 10 ). Table 10: PNH Study 1 Patient Baseline Characteristics Study 1 Parameter Placebo (N=44) Eculizumab (N=43) Mean age (SD) 38 (13) 42 (16) Gender - female (%) 29 (66) 23 (54) History of aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (%) 12 (27) 8 (19) Patients with history of thrombosis (events) 8 (11) 9 (16) Concomitant anticoagulants (%) 20 (46) 24 (56) Concomitant steroids/immunosuppressant treatments (%) 16 (36) 14 (33) Packed RBC units transfused per patient in previous 12 months (median (Q1,Q3)) 17 (14, 25) 18 (12, 24) Mean Hgb level (g/dL) at setpoint (SD) 8 (1) 8 (1) Pre-treatment LDH levels (median, U/L) 2,234 2,032 Free hemoglobin at baseline (median, mg/dL) 46 41 Patients treated with eculizumab had significantly reduced (p< 0.001) hemolysis resulting in improvements in anemia as indicated by increased hemoglobin stabilization and reduced need for RBC transfusions compared to placebo treated patients (see Table 11 ). These effects were seen among patients within each of the three pre-study RBC transfusion strata (4 - 14 units; 15 - 25 units; > 25 units). After 3 weeks of eculizumab treatment, patients reported less fatigue and improved health- related quality of life. Because of the study sample size and duration, the effects of eculizumab products on thrombotic events could not be determined. Table 11: PNH Study 1 Results Placebo (N=44) Eculizumab (N=43) Percentage of patients with stabilized hemoglobin levels 0 49 Packed RBC units transfused per patient (median) 10 0 (range) (2 - 21) (0 - 16) Transfusion avoidance (%) 0 51 LDH levels at end of study (median, U/L) 2,167 239 Free hemoglobin at end of study (median, mg/dL) 62 5 PNH Study 2 and Extension Study: PNH patients with at least one transfusion in the prior 24 months and at least 30,000 platelets/microliter received eculizumab over a 52-week period. Concomitant medications included anti- thrombotic agents in 63% of the patients and systemic corticosteroids in 40% of the patients. Overall, 96 of the 97 enrolled patients completed the study (one patient died following a thrombotic event). A reduction in intravascular hemolysis as measured by serum LDH levels was sustained for the treatment period and resulted in a reduced need for RBC transfusion and less fatigue. 187 eculizumab- treated PNH patients were enrolled in a long term extension study. All patients sustained a reduction in intravascular hemolysis over a total eculizumab exposure time ranging from 10 to 54 months. There were fewer thrombotic events with eculizumab treatment than during the same period of time prior to treatment. However, the majority of patients received concomitant anticoagulants; the effects of anticoagulant withdrawal during eculizumab products therapy was not studied [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]. 14.2 Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) Five single-arm studies [four prospective: C08-002A/B (NCT00844545 and NCT00844844), C08- 003A/B (NCT00838513 and NCT00844428), C10-003 (NCT01193348), and C10-004 (NCT01194973); and one retrospective: C09-001r (NCT01770951)] evaluated the safety and efficacy of eculizumab for the treatment of aHUS. Patients with aHUS received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of eculizumab or received prophylactic treatment with antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. In all studies, the dose of eculizumab in adult and adolescent patients was 900 mg every 7 \u00b1 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 1,200 mg 7 \u00b1 2 days later, then 1,200 mg every 14 \u00b1 2 days thereafter. The dosage regimen for pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg enrolled in Study C09-001r and Study C10-003 was based on body weight [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ]. Efficacy evaluations were based on thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) endpoints. Endpoints related to TMA included the following: platelet count change from baseline hematologic normalization ( maintenance of normal platelet counts and LDH levels for at least four weeks) complete TMA response ( hematologic normalization plus at least a 25% reduction in serum creatinine for a minimum of four weeks ) TMA-event free status ( absence for at least 12 weeks of a decrease in platelet count of >25% from baseline, plasma exchange or plasma infusion, and new dialysis requirement) Daily TMA intervention rate ( defined as the number of plasma exchange or plasma infusion interventions and the number of new dialyses required per patient per day ). aHUS Resistant to PE/PI (Study C08-002A/B) Study C08-002A/B enrolled patients who displayed signs of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) despite receiving at least four PE/PI treatments the week prior to screening. One patient had no PE/PI the week prior to screening because of PE/PI intolerance. In order to qualify for enrollment, patients were required to have a platelet count \u2264150 x 10 9 /L, evidence of hemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH, and serum creatinine above the upper limits of normal, without the need for chronic dialysis. The median patient age was 28 (range: 17 to 68 years). Patients enrolled in Study C08- 002A/B were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed range of values in the trial were 70%-121%. Seventy-six percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. Table 12 summarizes the key baseline clinical and disease-related characteristics of patients enrolled in Study C08-002A/B. Table 12: Baseline Characteristics of Patients Enrolled in Study C08-002A/B Parameter C08-002A/B (N=17) Time from aHUS diagnosis until screening in months, median (min, max) 10 (0.26, 236) Time from current clinical TMA manifestation until screening in months, median (min, max) <1 (<1, 4) Baseline platelet count (\u00d7 10 9 /L), median (range) 118 (62, 161) Baseline LDH (U/L), median (range) 269 (134, 634) Patients in Study C08-002A/B received eculizumab for a minimum of 26 weeks. In Study C08-002A/B, the median duration of eculizumab therapy was approximately 100 weeks (range: 2 weeks to 145 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved and maintained during eculizumab therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) increased from 23 \u00b1 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 at baseline to 56 \u00b1 40 mL/min/1.73m 2 by 26 weeks; this effect was maintained through 2 years (56 \u00b1 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). Four of the five patients who required dialysis at baseline were able to discontinue dialysis. Reduction in terminal complement activity and an increase in platelet count relative to baseline were observed after commencement of eculizumab. Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. In Study C08- 002A/B, mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 109 \u00b1 32 x10 9 /L at baseline to 169 \u00b1 72 x10 9 /L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (210 \u00b1 68 x10 9 /L), and 2 years (205 \u00b1 46 x10 9 /L). When treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, two additional patients achieved Hematologic Normalization as well as Complete TMA response. Hematologic Normalization and Complete TMA response were maintained by all responders. In Study C08-002A/B, responses to eculizumab were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins.

All patients had received PT at least once every two weeks, but no more than three times per week, for a minimum of eight weeks prior to the first eculizumab dose. Patients on chronic dialysis were permitted to enroll in Study C08- 003A/B. The median patient age was 28 years (range: 13 to 63 years). Patients enrolled in Study C08- 003A/B were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed range of values in the trial were 37%-118%. Seventy percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. Table 14 summarizes the key baseline clinical and disease-related characteristics of patients enrolled in Study C08-003A/B. Table 14: Baseline Characteristics of Patients Enrolled in Study C08-003A/B Parameter Study C08-003A/B (N=20) Time from aHUS diagnosis until screening in months, median (min, max) 48 (0.66, 286) Time from current clinical TMA manifestation until screening in months, median (min, max) 9 (1, 45) Baseline platelet count (\u00d7 10 9 /L), median (range) 218 (105, 421) Baseline LDH (U/L), median (range) 200 (151, 391) Patients in Study C08-003A/B received eculizumab for a minimum of 26 weeks. In Study C08-003A/B, the median duration of eculizumab therapy was approximately 114 weeks (range: 26 to 129 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was maintained during eculizumab therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) was 31 \u00b1 19 mL/min/1.73m 2 at baseline, and was maintained through 26 weeks (37 \u00b1 21 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) and 2 years (40 \u00b1 18 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). No patient required new dialysis with eculizumab. Reduction in terminal complement activity was observed in all patients after the commencement of eculizumab. Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. Platelet counts were maintained at normal levels despite the elimination of PE/PI. The mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) was 228 \u00b1 78 x 10 9 /L at baseline, 233 \u00b1 69 x 10 9 /L at week 26, and 224 \u00b1 52 x 10 9 /L at 2 years. When treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, six additional patients achieved Complete TMA response. Complete TMA Response and Hematologic Normalization were maintained by all responders. In Study C08-003A/B, responses to eculizumab were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins. Table 15 summarizes the efficacy results for Study C08-003A/B. Table 15: Efficacy Results for Study C08-003A/B 1. At data cut-off (September 8, 2010). 2. At data cut-off (April 20, 2012). 3. Calculated at each post-dose day of measurement (excluding Days 1 to 4) using a repeated measurement ANOVA model. 4. In Study C08-003A/B, 85% of patients had normal platelet counts and 80% of patients had normal serum LDH levels at baseline, so hematologic normalization in this population reflects maintenance of normal parameters in the absence of PE/PI.

Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline. Mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 171 \u00b1 83 x10 9 /L at baseline to 233 \u00b1109 x10 9 /L after one week of therapy; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) at week 26: 254 \u00b1 79 x10 9 /L). A total of 19 pediatric patients (ages 2 months to 17 years) received eculizumab in Study C09-001r. The median duration of eculizumab therapy was 16 weeks (range 4 to 70 weeks) for children <2 years of age (n=5), 31 weeks (range 19 to 63 weeks) for children 2 to <12 years of age (n=10), and 38 weeks (range 1 to 69 weeks) for patients 12 to <18 years of age (n=4). Fifty-three percent of pediatric patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. Overall, the efficacy results for these pediatric patients appeared consistent with what was observed in patients enrolled in Studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B (Table 16). No pediatric patient required new dialysis during treatment with eculizumab. Table 16: Efficacy Results in Pediatric Patients Enrolled in Study C09-001r 1. Platelet count normalization was defined as a platelet count of at least 150,000 X 10 9 /L on at least two consecutive measurements spanning a period of at least 4 weeks. 2.

In order to qualify for enrollment, patients were required to have a platelet count < lower limit of normal range (LLN), evidence of hemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH, and serum creatinine above the upper limits of normal, without the need for chronic dialysis. The median patient age was 35 (range: 18 to 80 years). All patients enrolled in Study C10-004 were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed range of values in the trial were 28%-116%. Fifty-one percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. A total of 35 patients received PE/PI prior to eculizumab. Table 17 summarizes the key baseline clinical and disease-related characteristics of patients enrolled in Study C10-004.

In Study C10-004, the median duration of eculizumab therapy was approximately 50 weeks (range: 13 weeks to 86 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved during eculizumab therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) increased from 17 \u00b1 12 mL/min/1.73m 2 at baseline to 47 \u00b1 24 mL/min/1.73m 2 by 26 weeks. Twenty of the 24 patients who required dialysis at study baseline were able to discontinue dialysis during eculizumab treatment. Reduction in terminal complement activity and an increase in platelet count relative to baseline were observed after commencement of eculizumab. Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. In Study C10- 004, mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 119 \u00b1 66 x10 9 /L at baseline to 200 \u00b1 84 x10 9 /L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) at week 26: 252 \u00b1 70 x10 9 /L). In Study C10-004, responses to eculizumab were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins or auto-antibodies to factor H.

In Study C10-003, the median duration of eculizumab therapy was approximately 44 weeks (range: 1 dose to 88 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved during eculizumab therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) increased from 33 \u00b1 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 at baseline to 98 \u00b1 44 mL/min/1.73m 2 by 26 weeks. Among the 20 patients with a CKD stage \u22652 at baseline, 17 (85%) achieved a CKD improvement of \u22651 stage. Among the 16 patients ages 1 month to <12 years with a CKD stage \u22652 at baseline, 14 (88%) achieved a CKD improvement by \u22651 stage. Nine of the 11 patients who required dialysis at study baseline were able to discontinue dialysis during eculizumab treatment. Responses were observed across all ages from 5 months to 17 years of age. Reduction in terminal complement activity was observed in all patients after commencement of eculizumab. Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. The mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 88 \u00b1 42 x10 9 /L at baseline to 281 \u00b1 123 x10 9 /L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (\u00b1SD) at week 26: 293 \u00b1 106 x10 9 /L). In Study C10-003, responses to eculizumab were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins or auto-antibodies to factor H.

A total of 62 patients were randomized to receive eculizumab treatment and 63 were randomized to receive placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups, including age at diagnosis (38 years in each group), gender [66% female (eculizumab) versus 65% female (placebo)], and duration of gMG [9.9 (eculizumab) versus 9.2 (placebo) years]. Over 95% of patients in each group were receiving acetylcholinesterase (AchE) inhibitors, and 98% were receiving immunosuppressant therapies (ISTs). Approximately 50% of each group had been previously treated with at least 3 ISTs. Eculizumab was administered according to the recommended dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. The primary efficacy endpoint for Study ECU-MG-301 was a comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the Myasthenia Gravis-Specific Activities of Daily Living scale (MGADL) total score at Week 26. The MG-ADL is a categorical scale that assesses the impact on daily function of 8 signs or symptoms that are typically affected in gMG. Each item is assessed on a 4point scale where a score of 0 represents normal function and a score of 3 represents loss of ability to perform that function (total score 0-24). A statistically significant difference favoring eculizumab was observed in the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in MG-ADL total scores [-4.2 points in the eculizumab-treated group compared with -2.3 points in the placebo-treated group (p=0.006)]. A key secondary endpoint in Study ECU-MG-301 was the change from baseline in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) total score at Week 26. The QMG is a 13-item categorical scale assessing muscle weakness. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents no weakness and a score of 3 represents severe weakness (total score 0-39). A statistically significant difference favoring eculizumab was observed in the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in QMG total scores [-4.6 points in the eculizumab-treated group compared with -1.6 points in the placebo-treated group (p=0.001)]. The results of the analysis of the MG-ADL and QMG from Study ECU-MG-301 are shown in Table 21. Table 21: Analysis of Change from Baseline to Week 26 in MG-ADL and QMG Total Scores in Study ECU-MG-301 SEM= Standard Error of the Mean; eculizumab-LSMean = least square mean for the treatment group; Placebo-LSMean = least square mean for the placebo group; LSMean-Difference (95% CI) = Difference in least square mean with 95% confidence interval; p-values (testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two treatment arms a : in least square means at Week 26 using a repeated measure analysis; b : in ranks at Week 26 using a worst rank analysis). Efficacy Endpoints Eculizumab-LS Mean (N=62) (SEM) Placebo-LS Mean (N=63) (SEM) Eculizumab change relative to placebo \u2013 LS Mean Difference (95% CI) p-values MG-ADL -4.2 (0.49) -2.3 (0.48) -1.9 (-3.3, -0.6) (0.006 a ; 0.014 b ) QMG -4.6 (0.60) -1.6 (0.59) -3.0 (-4.6, -1.3) (0.001 a ; 0.005 b ) In Study ECU-MG-301 , a clinical response was defined in the MG-ADL total score as at least a 3-point improvement and in QMG total score as at least a 5-point improvement. The proportion of clinical responders at Week 26 with no rescue therapy was statistically significantly higher for eculizumab compared to placebo for both measures. For both endpoints, and also at higher response thresholds (\u22654-, 5-, 6-, 7-, or 8-point improvement on MG-ADL, and \u22656-, 7-, 8-, 9-, or 10-point improvement on QMG), the proportion of clinical responders was consistently greater for eculizumab compared to placebo. Available data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved by 12 weeks of eculizumab treatment."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patients and/or caregivers to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide ). Serious Meningococcal Infections Advise patients of the risk of serious meningococcal infection. Inform patients of the need to complete or update their meningococcal vaccinations at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of EPYSQLI or receive antibacterial drug prophylaxis if EPYSQLI treatment must be initiated immediately and they have not been previously vaccinated. Inform patients of the requirement to be revaccinated according to current ACIP recommendations for meningococcal infection while on EPYSQLI therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Inform patients that vaccination may not prevent serious meningococcal infection and to seek immediate medical attention if the following signs or symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] : fever fever and a rash fever with high heart rate headache with nausea or vomiting headache and a fever headache with a stiff neck or stiff back confusion muscle aches with flu-like symptoms eyes sensitive to light Inform patients that they will be given a Patient Safety Card for EPYSQLI that they should carry with them at all times during and for 3 months following treatment with EPYSQLI. This card describes symptoms which, if experienced, should prompt the patient to immediately seek medical evaluation. EPYSQLI REMS EPYSQLI is available only through a restricted program called EPYSQLI REMS [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Inform the patient of the following notable requirements: Patients must receive counseling about the risk of serious meningococcal infections. Patients must receive written educational materials about this risk. Patients must be instructed to carry the Patient Safety Card with them at all times during and for 3 months following treatment with EPYSQLI. Patients must be instructed to complete or update meningococcal vaccines for serogroups A, C, W, Y and B per ACIP recommendations as directed by the prescriber prior to treatment with EPYSQLI. Patients must receive antibiotics as directed by the prescriber if they are not up to date with meningococcal vaccines and have to start EPYSQLI right away. Other Infections Counsel patients about gonorrhea prevention and advise regular testing for patients at-risk. Inform patients that there may be an increased risk of other types of infections, particularly those due to encapsulated bacteria. Aspergillus infections have occurred in immunocompromised and neutropenic patients. Inform parents or caregivers of children receiving EPYSQLI for the treatment of Ahus that their child should be vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) according to current medical guidelines. Infusion-Related Reactions Advise patients that administration of EPYSQLI may result in infusion-related reactions. Discontinuation Inform patients with PNH that they may develop serious hemolysis due to PNH when EPYSQLI is discontinued and that they will be monitored by their healthcare professional for at least 8 weeks following EPYSQLI discontinuation. Inform patients with aHUS that there is a potential for TMA complications due to aHUS when EPYSQLI is discontinued and that they will be monitored by their healthcare professional for at least 12 weeks following EPYSQLI discontinuation. Inform patients who discontinue EPYSQLI to keep the Patient Safety Card with them for three months after the last EPYSQLI dose, because the increased risk of meningococcal infection persists for several weeks following discontinuation of EPYSQLI.

EPYSQLI is a medicine that affects your immune system. EPYSQLI may lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. EPYSQLI increases your chance of getting serious meningococcal infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis bacteria. Meningococcal infections may quickly become life-threatening or cause death if not recognized and treated early. You must complete or update your meningococcal vaccines at least 2 weeks before your first dose of EPYSQLI. If you have not completed your meningococcal vaccines and EPYSQLI must be started right away, you should receive the required vaccine(s) as soon as possible. If you have not been vaccinated and EPYSQLI must be started right away, you should also receive antibiotics to take for as long as your healthcare provider tells you. If you had a meningococcal vaccine in the past, you might need additional vaccines before starting EPYSQLI. Your healthcare provider will decide if you need additional meningococcal vaccines. Meningococcal vaccines do not prevent all meningococcal infections. Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical care right away if you get any of these signs and symptoms of a serious meningococcal infection : fever fever with high heart rate headache and fever confusion muscle aches with flu-like symptoms fever and a rash headache with nausea or vomiting headache with a stiff neck or stiff back eyes sensitive to light Your healthcare provider will give you a Patient Safety Card about the risk of serious meningococcal infection. Carry it with you at all times during treatment and for 3 months after your last dose of EPYSQLI. Your risk of meningococcal infection may continue for several weeks after your last dose of EPYSQLI. It is important to show this card to any healthcare provider who treats you. This will help them diagnose and treat you quickly. EPYSQLI is only available through a program called the EPYSQLI Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Before you can receive EPYSQLI, your healthcare provider must: enroll in the EPYSQLI REMS program counsel you about the risk of serious meningococcal infections give you information about the signs and symptoms of serious meningococcal infection make sure that you are vaccinated against serious infections caused by meningococcal bacteria and that you receive antibiotics if you need to start EPYSQLI right away and you are not up to date on your vaccines give you a Patient Safety Card about your risk of meningococcal infection, as discussed above EPYSQLI may also increase the risk of other types of serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , and Neisseria gonorrhoeae . If your child is treated with EPYSQLI, your child should receive vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Certain people may be at risk of serious infections with gonorrhea. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether you are at risk for gonorrhea infection, about gonorrhea prevention, and regular testing. Certain fungal infections (aspergillus) may also happen if you take EPYSQLI and have a weak immune system or a low white blood cell count.

Dilute SOLIRIS to a final concentration of 5 mg/mL by adding the appropriate amount (equal volume of diluent to drug volume) of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose in Water Injection, USP; or Ringer's Injection, USP to the infusion bag. The final admixed SOLIRIS 5 mg/mL infusion volume is 60 mL for 300 mg doses, 120 mL for 600 mg doses, 180 mL for 900 mg doses or 240 mL for 1200 mg doses (Table 4). Table 4: Preparation and Reconstitution of SOLIRIS SOLIRIS Dose Diluent Volume Final Volume 300 mg 30 mL 60 mL 600 mg 60 mL 120 mL 900 mg 90 mL 180 mL 1200 mg 120 mL 240 mL Gently invert the infusion bag containing the diluted SOLIRIS solution to ensure thorough mixing of the product and diluent. Discard any unused portion left in a vial, as the product contains no preservatives. Prior to administration, the admixture should be allowed to adjust to room temperature [18\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C, 64\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F]. The admixture must not be heated in a microwave or with any heat source other than ambient air temperature. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.7 Administration Only administer as an intravenous infusion. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus injection. Administer the SOLIRIS admixture by intravenous infusion over 35 minutes in adults and 1 to 4 hours in pediatric patients via gravity feed, a syringe-type pump, or an infusion pump. Admixed solutions of SOLIRIS are stable for 24 h at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) and at room temperature. If an adverse reaction occurs during the administration of SOLIRIS, the infusion may be slowed or stopped at the discretion of the physician. If the infusion is slowed, the total infusion time should not exceed two hours in adults. Monitor the patient for at least one hour following completion of the infusion for signs or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Use caution when administering SOLIRIS to patients with any other systemic infection. ( 5.3 ) Infusion-Related Reactions: Monitor patients during infusion, interrupt for reactions, and institute appropriate supportive measures. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Serious Meningococcal Infections SOLIRIS, a complement inhibitor, increases a patient's susceptibility to serious, life-threatening, or fatal infections caused by meningococcal bacteria (septicemia and/or meningitis) in any serogroup, including non-groupable strains. Life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients treated with complement inhibitors. The initiation of SOLIRIS treatment is contraindicated in patients with unresolved serious Neisseria meningitidis infection. Complete or update meningococcal vaccination (for serogroups A, C, W, Y and B) at least 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of SOLIRIS, according to current ACIP recommendations for patients receiving a complement inhibitor. Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations, considering the duration of therapy with SOLIRIS. Note that ACIP recommends an administration schedule in patients receiving complement inhibitors that differs from the administration schedule in the vaccine prescribing information. If urgent SOLIRIS therapy is indicated in a patient who is not up to date with meningococcal vaccines according to ACIP recommendations, provide the patient with antibacterial drug prophylaxis and administer meningococcal vaccines as soon as possible. Various durations and regimens of antibacterial drug prophylaxis have been considered, but the optimal durations and drug regimens for prophylaxis and their efficacy have not been studied in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients receiving complement inhibitors, including SOLIRIS. The benefits and risks of treatment with SOLIRIS, as well as the benefits and risks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients, must be considered against the known risks for serious infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis . Vaccination does not eliminate the risk of serious meningococcal infections, despite development of antibodies following vaccination. Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and evaluate patients immediately if infection is suspected. Inform patients of these signs and symptoms and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care if these signs and symptoms occur. Promptly treat known infections. Meningococcal infection may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Consider interruption of SOLIRIS in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious meningococcal infection depending on the risks of interrupting treatment in the disease being treated. SOLIRIS is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 5.2 ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS REMS SOLIRIS is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS REMS, because of the risk of serious meningococcal infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Notable requirements of the ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS REMS include the following: Prescribers must enroll in the REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of serious meningococcal infection. Prescribers must provide the patients with the REMS educational materials. Prescribers must assess patient vaccination status for meningococcal vaccines (against serogroups A, C, W, Y and B) and vaccinate if needed according to current ACIP recommendations two weeks prior to the first dose of SOLIRIS. Prescribers must provide a prescription for antibacterial drug prophylaxis if treatment must be started urgently and the patient is not up to date with meningococcal vaccines according to current ACIP recommendations at least two weeks prior to the first dose of SOLIRIS. Healthcare settings and pharmacies that dispense SOLIRIS must be certified in the REMS and must verify prescribers are certified. Patients must receive counseling from the prescriber about the need to receive meningococcal vaccines per ACIP recommendations, the need to take antibiotics as directed by the prescriber, and the signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection. Patients must be instructed to carry the Patient Safety Card with them at all times during and for 3 months following treatment with SOLIRIS. Further information is available at www.UltSolREMS.com or 1-888-765-4747. 5.3 Other Infections Serious infections with Neisseria species (other than Neisseria meningitidis ), including disseminated gonococcal infections, have been reported. SOLIRIS blocks terminal complement activation; therefore patients may have increased susceptibility to infections, especially with encapsulated bacteria such as infections with Neisseria meningitidis but also Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , and to a lesser extent, Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Additionally, Aspergillus infections have occurred in immunocompromised and neutropenic patients. Children treated with SOLIRIS may be at increased risk of developing serious infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Administer vaccinations for the prevention of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infections according to ACIP recommendations. Patients receiving SOLIRIS are at increased risk for infections due to these organisms, even if they develop antibodies following vaccination. 5.4 Monitoring Disease Manifestations after SOLIRIS Discontinuation Treatment Discontinuation for PNH Monitor patients after discontinuing SOLIRIS for at least 8 weeks to detect hemolysis. Treatment Discontinuation for aHUS After discontinuing SOLIRIS, monitor patients with aHUS for signs and symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) complications for at least 12 weeks. In aHUS clinical trials, 18 patients (5 in the prospective studies) discontinued SOLIRIS treatment. TMA complications occurred following a missed dose in 5 patients, and SOLIRIS was reinitiated in 4 of these 5 patients. Clinical signs and symptoms of TMA include changes in mental status, seizures, angina, dyspnea, or thrombosis. In addition, the following changes in laboratory parameters may identify a TMA complication: occurrence of two, or repeated measurement of any one of the following: a decrease in platelet count by 25% or more compared to baseline or the peak platelet count during SOLIRIS treatment; an increase in serum creatinine by 25% or more compared to baseline or nadir during SOLIRIS treatment; or, an increase in serum LDH by 25% or more over baseline or nadir during SOLIRIS treatment. If TMA complications occur after SOLIRIS discontinuation, consider reinstitution of SOLIRIS treatment, plasma therapy [plasmapheresis, plasma exchange, or fresh frozen plasma infusion (PE/PI)], or appropriate organ-specific supportive measures. 5.5 Thrombosis Prevention and Management The effect of withdrawal of anticoagulant therapy during SOLIRIS treatment has not been established. Therefore, treatment with SOLIRIS should not alter anticoagulant management. 5.6 Infusion-Related Reactions Administration of SOLIRIS may result in infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions. In clinical trials, no patients experienced an infusion-related reaction which required discontinuation of SOLIRIS. Interrupt SOLIRIS infusion and institute appropriate supportive measures if signs of cardiovascular instability or respiratory compromise occur."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Serious Meningococcal Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Other Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Monitoring Disease Manifestations after SOLIRIS Discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Thrombosis Prevention and Management [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Infusion-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the PNH randomized trial (\u226510% overall and greater than placebo) are: headache, nasopharyngitis, back pain, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) The most frequently reported adverse reactions in aHUS single arm prospective trials (\u226520%) are: headache, diarrhea, hypertension, upper respiratory infection, abdominal pain, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, anemia, cough, peripheral edema, nausea, urinary tract infections, pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) The most frequently reported adverse reaction in the gMG placebo-controlled clinical trial (\u226510%) in adult patients is musculoskeletal pain. ( 6.1 ) The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the NMOSD placebo- controlled trial (\u226510%) are: upper respiratory infection, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, back pain, dizziness, influenza, arthralgia, pharyngitis, and contusion.

Meningococcal infections are the most important adverse reactions experienced by patients receiving SOLIRIS. In PNH clinical studies, two patients experienced meningococcal sepsis. Both patients had previously received a meningococcal vaccine. In clinical studies among patients without PNH, meningococcal meningitis occurred in one unvaccinated patient. Meningococcal sepsis occurred in one previously vaccinated patient enrolled in the retrospective aHUS study during the post-study follow-up period [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . PNH The data described below reflect exposure to SOLIRIS in 196 adult patients with PNH, age 18-85, of whom 55% were female. All had signs or symptoms of intravascular hemolysis. SOLIRIS was studied in a placebo-controlled clinical study (PNH Study 1, in which 43 patients received SOLIRIS and 44, placebo); a single arm clinical study (PNH Study 2); and a long term extension study (E05-001). 182 patients were exposed for greater than one year. All patients received the recommended SOLIRIS dose regimen. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a numerically higher rate in the SOLIRIS group than the placebo group and at a rate of 5% or more among patients treated with SOLIRIS. Table 5: Adverse Reactions Reported in 5% or More of SOLIRIS Treated Patients with PNH and Greater than Placebo in the Controlled Clinical Study Reaction SOLIRIS (N=43) N (%) Placebo (N=44) N (%) Headache 19 (44) 12 (27) Nasopharyngitis 10 (23) 8 (18) Back pain 8 (19) 4 (9) Nausea 7 (16) 5 (11) Fatigue 5 (12) 1 (2) Cough 5 (12) 4 (9) Herpes simplex infections 3 (7) 0 Sinusitis 3 (7) 0 Respiratory tract infection 3 (7) 1 (2) Constipation 3 (7) 2 (5) Myalgia 3 (7) 1 (2) Pain in extremity 3 (7) 1 (2) Influenza-like illness 2 (5) 1 (2) In the placebo-controlled clinical study, serious adverse reactions occurred among 4 (9%) patients receiving SOLIRIS and 9 (21%) patients receiving placebo. The serious reactions included infections and progression of PNH. No deaths occurred in the study and no patients receiving SOLIRIS experienced a thrombotic event; one thrombotic event occurred in a patient receiving placebo. Among 193 patients with PNH treated with SOLIRIS in the single arm, clinical study or the follow-up study, the adverse reactions were similar to those reported in the placebo-controlled clinical study. Serious adverse reactions occurred among 16% of the patients in these studies. The most common serious adverse reactions were: viral infection (2%), headache (2%), anemia (2%), and pyrexia (2%). aHUS The safety of SOLIRIS therapy in patients with aHUS was evaluated in four prospective, single-arm studies, three in adult and adolescent patients (Studies C08-002A/B, C08-003A/B, and C10-004), one in pediatric and adolescent patients (Study C10-003), and one retrospective study (Study C09-001r). The data described below were derived from 78 adult and adolescent patients with aHUS in Studies C08-002A/B, C08-003A/B and C10-004. All patients received the recommended dosage of SOLIRIS. Median exposure was 67 weeks (range: 2-145 weeks). Table 6 summarizes all adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients in Studies C08-002A/B, C08-003A/B and C10-004 combined.

The most commonly reported SAEs were infections (24%), hypertension (5%), chronic renal failure (5%), and renal impairment (5%). Five patients discontinued SOLIRIS due to adverse events; three due to worsening renal function, one due to new diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and one due to meningococcal meningitis. Study C10-003 included 22 pediatric and adolescent patients, of which 18 patients were less than 12 years of age. All patients received the recommended dosage of SOLIRIS. Median exposure was 44 weeks (range: 1 dose-87 weeks). Table 7 summarizes all adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients enrolled in Study C10-003.

The most commonly reported SAEs were hypertension (9%), viral gastroenteritis (9%), pyrexia (9%), and upper respiratory infection (9%). One patient discontinued SOLIRIS due to an adverse event (severe agitation). Analysis of retrospectively collected adverse event data from pediatric and adult patients enrolled in Study C09-001r (N=30) revealed a safety profile that was similar to that which was observed in the two prospective studies. Study C09-001r included 19 pediatric patients less than 18 years of age. Overall, the safety of SOLIRIS in pediatric patients with aHUS enrolled in Study C09-001r appeared similar to that observed in adult patients. The most common (\u226515%) adverse events occurring in pediatric patients are presented in Table 8.

Pediatric Patients 6 Years of Age and Older In a 26-week, single arm study evaluating the safety of SOLIRIS in 11 pediatric patients with gMG 12 to 17 years of age (Study ECU-MG-303), adverse reactions were consistent with those observed in adult patients with gMG [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. The safety of SOLIRIS in pediatric patients 6 to less than 12 years of age is expected to be similar to that of adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older treated with SOLIRIS. Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) In a placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effect of SOLIRIS for the treatment of NMOSD (NMOSD Study 1), 96 patients received SOLIRIS at the recommended dosage regimen and 47 patients received placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Patients were 19 to 75 years of age (mean 44 years of age), and 91% were female. Table 10 displays the most common adverse reactions from NMOSD Study 1 that occurred in \u22655% of SOLIRIS-treated patients and at a greater frequency than on placebo.

Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Spontaneous Reports Fatal or serious infections: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria sicca/subflava, Neisseria spp unspecified. Cases of cholestatic or mixed pattern liver injury with increased serum liver enzymes and bilirubin levels have been reported in adult and pediatric patients with aHUS who were treated with Soliris. These events occurred within 3 to 27 days after starting treatment. The median time to resolution (or return to baseline) was approximately 3 weeks."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data on outcomes of pregnancies that have occurred following SOLIRIS use in pregnant women have not identified a concern for specific adverse developmental outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ). Animal studies using a mouse analogue of the SOLIRIS molecule (murine anti-C5 antibody) showed increased rates of developmental abnormalities and an increased rate of dead and moribund offspring at doses 2-8 times the human dose ( see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defect and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or fetal/neonatal risk PNH in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes, including worsening cytopenias, thrombotic events, infections, bleeding, miscarriages and increased maternal mortality, and adverse fetal outcomes, including fetal death and premature delivery. aHUS in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes, including pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery, and adverse fetal/neonatal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), fetal death and low birth weight. Data Human Data A pooled analysis of prospectively (50.3%) and retrospectively (49.7%) collected data in more than 300 pregnant women with live births following exposure to SOLIRIS have not suggested safety concerns. However, these data cannot definitively exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy, because of the limited sample size. Animal Data Animal reproduction studies were conducted in mice using doses of a murine anti-C5 antibody that approximated 2-4 times (low dose) and 4-8 times (high dose) the recommended human SOLIRIS dose, based on a body weight comparison. When animal exposure to the antibody occurred in the time period from before mating until early gestation, no decrease in fertility or reproductive performance was observed. When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred during organogenesis, two cases of retinal dysplasia and one case of umbilical hernia were observed among 230 offspring born to mothers exposed to the higher antibody dose; however, the exposure did not increase fetal loss or neonatal death. When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred in the time period from implantation through weaning, a higher number of male offspring became moribund or died (1/25 controls, 2/25 low dose group, 5/25 high dose group). Surviving offspring had normal development and reproductive function. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Although limited published data does not report detectable levels of eculizumab in human milk, maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. Available information is insufficient to inform the effect of eculizumab on the breastfed infant. There are no data on the effects of eculizumab on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for SOLIRIS and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from eculizumab or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use PNH and NMOSD Safety and effectiveness of SOLIRIS for the treatment of PNH, or NMOSD in pediatric patients have not been established. aHUS The safety and effectiveness of SOLIRIS for the treatment of aHUS have been established in pediatric patients. Use of SOLIRIS in pediatric patients for this indication is supported by evidence from four adequate and well-controlled clinical studies assessing the safety and effectiveness of SOLIRIS for the treatment of aHUS. The studies included a total of 47 pediatric patients (ages 2 months to 17 years). The safety and effectiveness of SOLIRIS for the treatment of aHUS appear similar in pediatric and adult patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . gMG The safety and effectiveness of SOLIRIS for the treatment of gMG have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of SOLIRIS in pediatric patients for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled trial in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients with gMG who are 12 years of age and older, and pharmacokinetic and safety data in other pediatric populations aged 6 to less than 12 years [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Safety and effectiveness of SOLIRIS for the treatment of gMG in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years have not been established. Vaccinations Administer vaccinations for the prevention of infection due to Neisseria meningitidis , Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) according to ACIP guidelines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Fifty-one patients 65 years of age or older (15 with PNH, 4 with aHUS, 26 with gMG, and 6 with NMOSD) were treated with SOLIRIS in clinical trials in the approved indications. Although there were no apparent age-related differences observed in these studies, the number of patients aged 65 and over is not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred in the time period from implantation through weaning, a higher number of male offspring became moribund or died (1/25 controls, 2/25 low dose group, 5/25 high dose group). Surviving offspring had normal development and reproductive function."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use PNH and NMOSD Safety and effectiveness of SOLIRIS for the treatment of PNH, or NMOSD in pediatric patients have not been established. aHUS The safety and effectiveness of SOLIRIS for the treatment of aHUS have been established in pediatric patients. Use of SOLIRIS in pediatric patients for this indication is supported by evidence from four adequate and well-controlled clinical studies assessing the safety and effectiveness of SOLIRIS for the treatment of aHUS. The studies included a total of 47 pediatric patients (ages 2 months to 17 years). The safety and effectiveness of SOLIRIS for the treatment of aHUS appear similar in pediatric and adult patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . gMG The safety and effectiveness of SOLIRIS for the treatment of gMG have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of SOLIRIS in pediatric patients for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled trial in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients with gMG who are 12 years of age and older, and pharmacokinetic and safety data in other pediatric populations aged 6 to less than 12 years [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] .

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Eculizumab, the active ingredient in SOLIRIS, is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. SOLIRIS inhibits terminal complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients and complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in patients with aHUS. The precise mechanism by which eculizumab exerts its therapeutic effect in gMG patients is unknown, but is presumed to involve reduction of terminal complement complex C5b-9 deposition at the neuromuscular junction. The precise mechanism by which eculizumab exerts its therapeutic effect in NMOSD is unknown, but is presumed to involve inhibition of aquaporin-4-antibody induced terminal complement C5b-9 deposition. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In the placebo-controlled clinical study (PNH Study 1), SOLIRIS when administered as recommended reduced serum LDH levels from 2200 \u00b1 1034 U/L (mean \u00b1 SD) at baseline to 700 \u00b1 388 U/L by week one and maintained the effect through the end of the study at week 26 (327 \u00b1 433 U/L) in patients with PNH. In the single arm clinical study (PNH Study 2), the effect was maintained through week 52 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . In patients with PNH, aHUS, gMG, and NMOSD, free C5 concentrations of < 0.5 mcg/mL was correlated with complete blockade of terminal complement activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous maintenance doses of 900 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with PNH, the week 26 observed mean \u00b1 SD serum eculizumab maximum concentration (C max ) was 194 \u00b1 76 mcg/mL and the trough concentration (C trough ) was 97 \u00b1 60 mcg/mL. Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1200 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with aHUS, the week 26 observed mean \u00b1 SD C trough was 242 \u00b1 101 mcg/mL. Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1200 mg once every 2 weeks in adult patients with gMG, the week 26 observed mean \u00b1 SD C max was 783 \u00b1 288 mcg/mL and the C trough was 341 \u00b1 172 mcg/mL. Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1200 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with NMOSD, at week 24, the observed mean\u00b1SD C max was 877\u00b1331 and the C trough was 429\u00b1188 mcg/mL. Steady state was achieved 4 weeks after starting eculizumab treatment, with accumulation ratio of approximately 2-fold in all studied indications. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that eculizumab pharmacokinetics were dose-linear and time-independent over the 600 mg to 1200 mg dose range, with inter-individual variability of 21% to 38%. Distribution The eculizumab volume of distribution for a typical 70 kg patient was 5 L to 8 L. Elimination The half life of eculizumab ranged between 141 h and 882 h. Plasma exchange or infusion increased the clearance of eculizumab by approximately 6.01-fold and reduced the half-life to 90.2 h. Supplemental dosing is recommended when SOLIRIS is administered to patients receiving plasma exchange or infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Specific Populations Age, Sex, and Race The pharmacokinetics of eculizumab were not affected by age (2 months to 85 years), sex, or race. Renal Impairment Renal function did not affect the pharmacokinetics of eculizumab in PNH (creatinine clearance of 8 mL/min to 396 mL/min calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula), aHUS (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to105 mL/min/1.73 m 2 using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] formula), or gMG patients (eGFR of 44 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to 168 mL/min/1.73 m 2 using MDRD formula). 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity(s) and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of SOLIRIS or of other eculizumab products. The immunogenicity of SOLIRIS has been evaluated using two different immunoassays for the detection of anti-eculizumab antibodies: a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the Fab fragment of eculizumab as target was used for the PNH indication; and an electro-chemiluminescence (ECL) bridging assay using the eculizumab whole molecule as target was used for the aHUS, gMG, and NMOSD indications, as well as for additional patients with PNH. In the PNH population, antibodies to SOLIRIS were detected in 3/196 (2%) patients using the ELISA assay and in 5/161 (3%) patients using the ECL assay during the entire treatment period. In the aHUS population, antibodies to SOLIRIS were detected in 3/100 (3%) patients using the ECL assay during the entire treatment period. In the gMG population, none of the 62 adult patients and 11 pediatric patients had antibodies to SOLIRIS detected following the 26-week active treatment. In the NMOSD population, antibodies to SOLIRIS were detected in 2/96 (2%) patients during the entire treatment period. An ECL based neutralizing assay with a low sensitivity of 2 mcg/mL was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies for the 5 patients with PNH, the 3 patients with aHUS, and the 2 patients with NMOSD with anti-eculizumab antibody positive samples using the ECL assay. Two of 161 patients with PNH (1.2%) and 1 of 100 patients with aHUS (1%), and none of the 96 patients with NMOSD had low positive values for neutralizing antibodies. No apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response was observed."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) The safety and efficacy of SOLIRIS in PNH patients with hemolysis were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 26 week study (PNH Study 1, NCT00122330); PNH patients were also treated with SOLIRIS in a single arm 52 week study (PNH Study 2, NCT00122304) and in a long-term extension study (E05-001, NCT00122317). Patients received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of SOLIRIS. In all studies, the dose of SOLIRIS was 600 mg study drug every 7 \u00b1 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg 7 \u00b1 2 days later, then 900 mg every 14 \u00b1 2 days for the study duration. SOLIRIS was administered as an intravenous infusion over 25 - 45 minutes. PNH Study 1 PNH patients with at least four transfusions in the prior 12 months, flow cytometric confirmation of at least 10% PNH cells and platelet counts of at least 100,000/microliter were randomized to either SOLIRIS (n = 43) or placebo (n = 44). Prior to randomization, all patients underwent an initial observation period to confirm the need for RBC transfusion and to identify the hemoglobin concentration (the \"set-point\") which would define each patient's hemoglobin stabilization and transfusion outcomes. The hemoglobin set-point was less than or equal to 9 g/dL in patients with symptoms and was less than or equal to 7 g/dL in patients without symptoms. Endpoints related to hemolysis included the numbers of patients achieving hemoglobin stabilization, the number of RBC units transfused, fatigue, and health-related quality of life. To achieve a designation of hemoglobin stabilization, a patient had to maintain a hemoglobin concentration above the hemoglobin set-point and avoid any RBC transfusion for the entire 26 week period. Hemolysis was monitored mainly by the measurement of serum LDH levels, and the proportion of PNH RBCs was monitored by flow cytometry. Patients receiving anticoagulants and systemic corticosteroids at baseline continued these medications. Major baseline characteristics were balanced (see Table 11 ). Table 11: PNH Study 1 Patient Baseline Characteristics Study 1 Parameter Placebo (N=44) SOLIRIS (N=43) Mean age (SD) 38 (13) 42 (16) Gender - female (%) 29 (66) 23 (54) History of aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (%) 12 (27) 8 (19) Patients with history of thrombosis (events) 8 (11) 9 (16) Concomitant anticoagulants (%) 20 (46) 24 (56) Concomitant steroids/immunosuppressant treatments (%) 16 (36) 14 (33) Packed RBC units transfused per patient in previous 12 months (median (Q1,Q3)) 17 (14, 25) 18 (12, 24) Mean Hgb level (g/dL) at setpoint (SD) 8 (1) 8 (1) Pre-treatment LDH levels (median, U/L) 2,234 2,032 Free hemoglobin at baseline (median, mg/dL) 46 41 Patients treated with SOLIRIS had significantly reduced (p< 0.001) hemolysis resulting in improvements in anemia as indicated by increased hemoglobin stabilization and reduced need for RBC transfusions compared to placebo treated patients (see Table 12 ). These effects were seen among patients within each of the three pre-study RBC transfusion strata (4 - 14 units; 15 - 25 units; > 25 units). After 3 weeks of SOLIRIS treatment, patients reported less fatigue and improved health-related quality of life. Because of the study sample size and duration, the effects of SOLIRIS on thrombotic events could not be determined.

Concomitant medications included anti-thrombotic agents in 63% of the patients and systemic corticosteroids in 40% of the patients. Overall, 96 of the 97 enrolled patients completed the study (one patient died following a thrombotic event). A reduction in intravascular hemolysis as measured by serum LDH levels was sustained for the treatment period and resulted in a reduced need for RBC transfusion and less fatigue. 187 SOLIRIS-treated PNH patients were enrolled in a long term extension study. All patients sustained a reduction in intravascular hemolysis over a total SOLIRIS exposure time ranging from 10 to 54 months. There were fewer thrombotic events with SOLIRIS treatment than during the same period of time prior to treatment. However, the majority of patients received concomitant anticoagulants; the effects of anticoagulant withdrawal during SOLIRIS therapy was not studied [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 14.2 Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) Five single-arm studies [four prospective: C08-002A/B (NCT00844545 and NCT00844844), C08-003A/B (NCT00838513 and NCT00844428), C10-003 (NCT01193348), and C10-004 (NCT01194973); and one retrospective: C09-001r (NCT01770951)] evaluated the safety and efficacy of SOLIRIS for the treatment of aHUS. Patients with aHUS received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of SOLIRIS or received prophylactic treatment with antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. In all studies, the dose of SOLIRIS in adult and adolescent patients was 900 mg every 7 \u00b1 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 1200 mg 7 \u00b1 2 days later, then 1200 mg every 14 \u00b1 2 days thereafter. The dosage regimen for pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg enrolled in Study C09-001r and Study C10-003 was based on body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Efficacy evaluations were based on thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) endpoints. Endpoints related to TMA included the following: platelet count change from baseline hematologic normalization (maintenance of normal platelet counts and LDH levels for at least four weeks) complete TMA response (hematologic normalization plus at least a 25% reduction in serum creatinine for a minimum of four weeks) TMA-event free status (absence for at least 12 weeks of a decrease in platelet count of >25% from baseline, plasma exchange or plasma infusion, and new dialysis requirement) Daily TMA intervention rate (defined as the number of plasma exchange or plasma infusion interventions and the number of new dialyses required per patient per day). aHUS Resistant to PE/PI (Study C08-002A/B) Study C08-002A/B enrolled patients who displayed signs of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) despite receiving at least four PE/PI treatments the week prior to screening. One patient had no PE/PI the week prior to screening because of PE/PI intolerance. In order to qualify for enrollment, patients were required to have a platelet count \u2264150 \u00d7 10 9 /L, evidence of hemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH, and serum creatinine above the upper limits of normal, without the need for chronic dialysis. The median patient age was 28 (range: 17 to 68 years). Patients enrolled in Study C08-002A/B were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed range of values in the trial were 70%-121%. Seventy-six percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. Table 13 summarizes the key baseline clinical and disease-related characteristics of patients enrolled in Study C08-002A/B.

In Study C08-002A/B, the median duration of SOLIRIS therapy was approximately 100 weeks (range: 2 weeks to 145 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved and maintained during SOLIRIS therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) increased from 23 \u00b1 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 at baseline to 56 \u00b1 40 mL/min/1.73m 2 by 26 weeks; this effect was maintained through 2 years (56 \u00b1 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). Four of the five patients who required dialysis at baseline were able to discontinue dialysis. Reduction in terminal complement activity and an increase in platelet count relative to baseline were observed after commencement of SOLIRIS. SOLIRIS reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. In Study C08-002A/B, mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 109 \u00b1 32 \u00d710 9 /L at baseline to 169 \u00b1 72 \u00d710 9 /L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (210 \u00b1 68 \u00d710 9 /L), and 2 years (205 \u00b1 46 \u00d710 9 /L). When treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, two additional patients achieved Hematologic Normalization as well as Complete TMA response. Hematologic Normalization and Complete TMA response were maintained by all responders. In Study C08-002A/B, responses to SOLIRIS were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins.

Patients on chronic dialysis were permitted to enroll in Study C08-003A/B. The median patient age was 28 years (range: 13 to 63 years). Patients enrolled in Study C08-003A/B were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed range of values in the trial were 37%-118%.

In Study C08-003A/B, the median duration of SOLIRIS therapy was approximately 114 weeks (range: 26 to 129 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was maintained during SOLIRIS therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) was 31 \u00b1 19 mL/min/1.73m 2 at baseline, and was maintained through 26 weeks (37 \u00b1 21 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) and 2 years (40 \u00b1 18 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). No patient required new dialysis with SOLIRIS. Reduction in terminal complement activity was observed in all patients after the commencement of SOLIRIS. SOLIRIS reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. Platelet counts were maintained at normal levels despite the elimination of PE/PI. The mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) was 228 \u00b1 78 \u00d7 10 9 /L at baseline, 233 \u00b1 69 \u00d7 10 9 /L at week 26, and 224 \u00b1 52 \u00d7 10 9 /L at 2 years.

SOLIRIS reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline. Mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 171 \u00b1 83 \u00d710 9 /L at baseline to 233 \u00b1109 \u00d710 9 /L after one week of therapy; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) at week 26: 254 \u00b1 79 \u00d710 9 /L). A total of 19 pediatric patients (ages 2 months to 17 years) received SOLIRIS in Study C09-001r. The median duration of SOLIRIS therapy was 16 weeks (range 4 to 70 weeks) for children <2 years of age (n=5), 31 weeks (range 19 to 63 weeks) for children 2 to <12 years of age (n=10), and 38 weeks (range 1 to 69 weeks) for patients 12 to <18 years of age (n=4). Fifty-three percent of pediatric patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. Overall, the efficacy results for these pediatric patients appeared consistent with what was observed in patients enrolled in Studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B (Table 17). No pediatric patient required new dialysis during treatment with SOLIRIS.

In order to qualify for enrollment, patients were required to have a platelet count < lower limit of normal range (LLN), evidence of hemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH, and serum creatinine above the upper limits of normal, without the need for chronic dialysis. The median patient age was 35 (range: 18 to 80 years). All patients enrolled in Study C10-004 were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed range of values in the trial were 28%-116%. Fifty-one percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. A total of 35 patients received PE/PI prior to eculizumab. Table 18 summarizes the key baseline clinical and disease-related characteristics of patients enrolled in Study C10-004.

In Study C10-004, the median duration of SOLIRIS therapy was approximately 50 weeks (range: 13 weeks to 86 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved during SOLIRIS therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) increased from 17 \u00b1 12 mL/min/1.73m 2 at baseline to 47 \u00b1 24 mL/min/1.73m 2 by 26 weeks. Twenty of the 24 patients who required dialysis at study baseline were able to discontinue dialysis during SOLIRIS treatment. Reduction in terminal complement activity and an increase in platelet count relative to baseline were observed after commencement of SOLIRIS. SOLIRIS reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. In Study C10-004, mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 119 \u00b1 66 \u00d710 9 /L at baseline to 200 \u00b1 84 \u00d710 9 /L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) at week 26: 252 \u00b1 70 \u00d710 9 /L). In Study C10-004, responses to SOLIRIS were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins or auto-antibodies to factor H.

The median patient age was 6.5 (range: 5 months to 17 years). Patients enrolled in Study C10-003 were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed range of values in the trial were 38%-121%. Fifty percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. A total of 10 patients received PE/PI prior to eculizumab. Table 20 summarizes the key baseline clinical and disease-related characteristics of patients enrolled in Study C10-003.

In Study C10-003, the median duration of SOLIRIS therapy was approximately 44 weeks (range: 1 dose to 88 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved during SOLIRIS therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) increased from 33 \u00b1 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 at baseline to 98 \u00b1 44 mL/min/1.73m 2 by 26 weeks. Among the 20 patients with a CKD stage \u22652 at baseline, 17 (85%) achieved a CKD improvement of \u22651 stage. Among the 16 patients ages 1 month to <12 years with a CKD stage \u22652 at baseline, 14 (88%) achieved a CKD improvement by \u22651 stage. Nine of the 11 patients who required dialysis at study baseline were able to discontinue dialysis during SOLIRIS treatment. Responses were observed across all ages from 5 months to 17 years of age. Reduction in terminal complement activity was observed in all patients after commencement of SOLIRIS. SOLIRIS reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. The mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 88 \u00b1 42 \u00d710 9 /L at baseline to 281 \u00b1 123 \u00d710 9 /L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (\u00b1SD) at week 26: 293 \u00b1 106 \u00d710 9 /L). In Study C10-003, responses to SOLIRIS were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins or auto-antibodies to factor H.

A total of 62 patients were randomized to receive SOLIRIS treatment and 63 were randomized to receive placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups, including age at diagnosis (38 years in each group), gender [66% female (eculizumab) versus 65% female (placebo)], and duration of gMG [9.9 (eculizumab) versus 9.2 (placebo) years]. Over 95% of patients in each group were receiving acetylcholinesterase (AchE) inhibitors, and 98% were receiving immunosuppressant therapies (ISTs). Approximately 50% of each group had been previously treated with at least 3 ISTs. SOLIRIS was administered according to the recommended dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . The primary efficacy endpoint for Study ECU-MG-301 was a comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the Myasthenia Gravis-Specific Activities of Daily Living scale (MG-ADL) total score at Week 26. The MG-ADL is a categorical scale that assesses the impact on daily function of 8 signs or symptoms that are typically affected in gMG. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents normal function and a score of 3 represents loss of ability to perform that function (total score 0-24). A statistically significant difference favoring SOLIRIS was observed in the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in MG-ADL total scores [-4.2 points in the SOLIRIS-treated group compared with -2.3 points in the placebo-treated group (p=0.006)]. A key secondary endpoint in Study ECU-MG-301 was the change from baseline in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) total score at Week 26. The QMG is a 13-item categorical scale assessing muscle weakness. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents no weakness and a score of 3 represents severe weakness (total score 0-39). A statistically significant difference favoring SOLIRIS was observed in the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in QMG total scores [-4.6 points in the SOLIRIS-treated group compared with -1.6 points in the placebo-treated group (p=0.001)]. The results of the analysis of the MG-ADL and QMG from Study ECU-MG-301 are shown in Table 22. Table 22: Analysis of Change from Baseline to Week 26 in MG-ADL and QMG Total Scores in Study ECU-MG-301 Efficacy Endpoints SOLIRIS-LS Mean (N=62) (SEM) Placebo-LS Mean (N=63) (SEM) SOLIRIS change relative to placebo \u2013 LS Mean Difference (95% CI) p-values SEM= Standard Error of the Mean; SOLIRIS-LSMean = least square mean for the treatment group; Placebo-LSMean = least square mean for the placebo group; LSMean-Difference (95% CI) = Difference in least square mean with 95% confidence interval; p-values (testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two treatment arms MG-ADL -4.2 (0.49) -2.3 (0.48) -1.9 (-3.3, -0.6) (0.006 in least square means at Week 26 using a repeated measure analysis; ; 0.014 in ranks at Week 26 using a worst rank analysis). ) QMG -4.6 (0.60) -1.6 (0.59) -3.0 (-4.6, -1.3) (0.001 ; 0.005 ) In Study ECU-MG-301, a clinical response was defined in the MG-ADL total score as at least a 3-point improvement and in QMG total score as at least a 5-point improvement. The proportion of clinical responders at Week 26 with no rescue therapy was statistically significantly higher for SOLIRIS compared to placebo for both measures. For both endpoints, and also at higher response thresholds (\u22654-, 5-, 6-, 7-, or 8-point improvement on MG-ADL, and \u22656-, 7-, 8-, 9-, or 10-point improvement on QMG), the proportion of clinical responders was consistently greater for SOLIRIS compared to placebo. Available data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved by 12 weeks of SOLIRIS treatment. 14.4 Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) The efficacy of SOLIRIS for the treatment of NMOSD was established in NMOSD Study 1 (NCT01892345), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 143 patients with NMOSD who were anti-AQP4 antibody positive and met the following criteria at screening: History of at least 2 relapses in last 12 months or 3 relapses in the last 24 months, with at least 1 relapse in the 12 months prior to screening, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score \u2264 7 (consistent with the presence of at least limited ambulation with aid), If on immunosuppressive therapy (IST), on a stable dose regimen, The use of concurrent corticosteroids was limited to 20 mg per day or less, Patients were excluded if they had been treated with rituximab or mitoxantrone within 3 months or with IVIg within 3 weeks prior to screening. A total of 96 patients were randomized to receive SOLIRIS treatment and 47 were randomized to receive placebo. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between treatment groups. During the treatment phase of the trial, 76% percent of patients received concomitant IST, including chronic corticosteroids; 24% of patients did not receive concomitant IST or chronic corticosteroids during the treatment phase of the trial. SOLIRIS was administered according to the recommended dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . The primary endpoint for NMOSD Study 1 was the time to the first adjudicated on-trial relapse. The time to the first adjudicated on-trial relapse was significantly longer in SOLIRIS-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients (relative risk reduction 94%; hazard ratio 0.058; p < 0.0001) (Figure 1). Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier Survival Estimates for Time to First Adjudicated On-Trial Relapse \u2013 Full Analysis Set Note: Patients who did not experience an adjudicated on-trial relapse were censored at the end of the study period. Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval SOLIRIS-treated patients experienced similar improvement in time to first adjudicated on-trial relapse with or without concomitant treatment. SOLIRIS-treated patients had a 96% relative reduction in the adjudicated on-trial annualized relapse rate (ARR) compared to patients on placebo, as shown in Table 23.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patients and/or caregivers to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Serious Meningococcal Infections Advise patients of the risk of serious meningococcal infection. Inform patients of the need to complete or update their meningococcal vaccinations at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of SOLIRIS or receive antibacterial drug prophylaxis if SOLIRIS treatment must be initiated immediately and they have not been previously vaccinated. Inform patients of the requirement to be revaccinated according to current ACIP recommendations for meningococcal infection while on SOLIRIS therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Inform patients that vaccination may not prevent serious meningococcal infection and to seek immediate medical attention if the following signs or symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] : fever fever and a rash fever with high heart rate headache with nausea or vomiting headache and a fever headache with a stiff neck or stiff back confusion muscle aches with flu-like symptoms eyes sensitive to light Inform patients that they will be given a Patient Safety Card for SOLIRIS that they should carry with them at all times during and for 3 months following treatment with SOLIRIS. This card describes symptoms which, if experienced, should prompt the patient to immediately seek medical evaluation. ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS REMS SOLIRIS is available only through a restricted program called ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Inform the patient of the following notable requirements: Patients must receive counseling about the risk of serious meningococcal infections. Patients must receive written educational materials about this risk. Patients must be instructed to carry the Patient Safety Card with them at all times during and for 3 months following treatment with SOLIRIS. Patients must be instructed to complete or update meningococcal vaccines for serogroups A, C, W, Y and B per ACIP recommendations as directed by the prescriber prior to treatment with SOLIRIS. Patients must receive antibiotics as directed by the prescriber if they are not up to date with meningococcal vaccines and have to start SOLIRIS right away. Other Infections Counsel patients about gonorrhea prevention and advise regular testing for patients at-risk. Inform patients that there may be an increased risk of other types of infections, particularly those due to encapsulated bacteria. Aspergillus infections have occurred in immunocompromised and neutropenic patients. Inform parents or caregivers of children receiving SOLIRIS that their child should be vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) according to current medical guidelines. Infusion-Related Reactions Advise patients that administration of SOLIRIS may result in infusion-related reactions. Discontinuation Inform patients with PNH that they may develop serious hemolysis due to PNH when SOLIRIS is discontinued and that they will be monitored by their healthcare professional for at least 8 weeks following SOLIRIS discontinuation. Inform patients with aHUS that there is a potential for TMA complications due to aHUS when SOLIRIS is discontinued and that they will be monitored by their healthcare professional for at least 12 weeks following SOLIRIS discontinuation. Inform patients who discontinue SOLIRIS to keep the Patient Safety Card with them for three months after the last SOLIRIS dose, because the increased risk of meningococcal infection persists for several weeks following discontinuation of SOLIRIS."

      "This Medication Guide has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Revised: 02/2025 MEDICATION GUIDE SOLIRIS \u00ae (so-leer-is) (eculizumab) injection, for intravenous use What is the most important information I should know about SOLIRIS? SOLIRIS is a medicine that affects your immune system. SOLIRIS may lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. SOLIRIS increases your chance of getting serious meningococcal infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis bacteria. Meningococcal infections may quickly become life-threatening or cause death if not recognized and treated early. You must complete or update your meningococcal vaccine(s) at least 2 weeks before your first dose of SOLIRIS. If you have not completed your meningococcal vaccines and SOLIRIS must be started right away, you should receive the required vaccine(s) as soon as possible. If you have not been vaccinated and SOLIRIS must be started right away, you should also receive antibiotics to take for as long as your healthcare provider tells you. If you had a meningococcal vaccine in the past, you might need additional vaccines before starting SOLIRIS. Your healthcare provider will decide if you need additional meningococcal vaccines. Meningococcal vaccines do not prevent all meningococcal infections. Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical care right away if you get any of these signs and symptoms of a serious meningococcal infection : fever fever with high heart rate headache and fever confusion muscle aches with flu-like symptoms fever and a rash headache with nausea or vomiting headache with a stiff neck or stiff back eyes sensitive to light Your healthcare provider will give you a Patient Safety Card about the risk of serious meningococcal infection. Carry it with you at all times during treatment and for 3 months after your last dose of SOLIRIS. Your risk of meningococcal infection may continue for several weeks after your last dose of SOLIRIS.
