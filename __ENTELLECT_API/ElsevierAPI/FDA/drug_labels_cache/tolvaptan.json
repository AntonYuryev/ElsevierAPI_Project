      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tolvaptan tablets should be initiated and re-initiated in a hospital ( 2.1 ) The recommended starting dose is 15 mg once daily. Dosage may be increased at intervals \u226524 hr to 30 mg once daily, and to a maximum of 60 mg once daily as needed to raise serum sodium. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Patients should be in a hospital for initiation and re-initiation of therapy to evaluate the therapeutic response and because too rapid correction of hyponatremia can cause osmotic demyelination resulting in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma and death. The usual starting dose for tolvaptan tablets is 15 mg administered once daily without regard to meals. Increase the dose to 30 mg once daily, after at least 24 hours, to a maximum of 60 mg once daily, as needed to achieve the desired level of serum sodium. Do not administer tolvaptan tablets for more than 30 days to minimize the risk of liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. During initiation and titration, frequently monitor for changes in serum electrolytes and volume. Avoid fluid restriction during the first 24 hours of therapy. Patients receiving tolvaptan tablets should be advised that they can continue ingestion of fluid in response to thirst [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 2.2 Drug Withdrawal Following discontinuation from tolvaptan tablets, patients should be advised to resume fluid restriction and should be monitored for changes in serum sodium and volume status."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Liver injury: Limit treatment duration to 30 days. If hepatic injury is suspected, discontinue tolvaptan. Avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease ( 5.2 ) Dehydration and hypovolemia may require intervention ( 5.3 ) Avoid use with hypertonic saline ( 5.4 ) Avoid use with moderate to strong CYP 3A inhibitors ( 5.5 ) Monitor serum potassium in patients with potassium >5 mEq/L or on drugs known to increase potassium ( 5.6 ) Urinary outflow obstruction: Urinary output must be secured ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Too Rapid Correction of Serum Sodium Can Cause Serious Neurologic Sequelae Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a risk associated with too rapid correction of hyponatremia (e.g., >12 mEq/L/24 hours). Osmotic demyelination results in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma or death. In susceptible patients, including those with severe malnutrition, alcoholism or advanced liver disease, slower rates of correction may be advisable. In controlled clinical trials in which tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses starting at 15 mg once daily, 7% of tolvaptan-treated subjects with a serum sodium <130 mEq/L had an increase in serum sodium greater than 8 mEq/L at approximately 8 hours and 2% had an increase greater than 12 mEq/L at 24 hours. Approximately 1% of placebo-treated subjects with a serum sodium <130 mEq/L had a rise greater than 8 mEq/L at 8 hours and no patient had a rise greater than 12 mEq/L/24 hours. Osmotic demyelination syndrome has been reported in association with tolvaptan therapy [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Patients treated with tolvaptan should be monitored to assess serum sodium concentrations and neurologic status, especially during initiation and after titration. Subjects with SIADH or very low baseline serum sodium concentrations may be at greater risk for too-rapid correction of serum sodium. In patients receiving tolvaptan who develop too rapid a rise in serum sodium, discontinue or interrupt treatment with tolvaptan and consider administration of hypotonic fluid. Fluid restriction during the first 24 hours of therapy with tolvaptan may increase the likelihood of overly rapid correction of serum sodium and should generally be avoided. Co-administration of diuretics also increases the risk of too rapid correction of serum sodium and such patients should undergo close monitoring of serum sodium. 5.2 Liver Injury Tolvaptan can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury. In placebo-controlled studies and an open label extension study of chronically administered tolvaptan in patients with ADPKD, cases of serious liver injury attributed to tolvaptan, generally occuring during the first 18 months of therapy, were observed. In postmarketing experience with tolvaptan in ADPKD, acute injury resulting in liver failure requiring liver transplantation has been reported. Tolvaptan should not be used to treat ADPKD outside of the FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for ADPKD patients [ see Contraindications (4.1) ]. Patients with symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice should discontinue treatment with tolvaptan. Limit duration of therapy with tolvaptan to 30 days. Avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease, including cirrhosis, because the ability to recover from liver injury may be impaired [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.3 Dehydration and Hypovolemia Tolvaptan therapy induces copious aquaresis, which is normally partially offset by fluid intake. Dehydration and hypovolemia can occur, especially in potentially volume-depleted patients receiving diuretics or those who are fluid restricted. In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials in which 607 hyponatremic patients were treated with tolvaptan, the incidence of dehydration was 3.3% for tolvaptan and 1.5% for placebo-treated patients. In patients receiving tolvaptan who develop medically significant signs or symptoms of hypovolemia, interrupt or discontinue tolvaptan therapy and provide supportive care with careful management of vital signs, fluid balance and electrolytes. Fluid restriction during therapy with tolvaptan may increase the risk of dehydration and hypovolemia. Patients receiving tolvaptan should continue ingestion of fluid in response to thirst. 5.4 Co-administration with Hypertonic Saline Concomitant use with hypertonic saline is not recommended. 5.5 Drug Interactions Tolvaptan is a substrate of CYP3A. Moderate to strong CYP3A inhibitors can lead to a marked increase in tolvaptan concentrations [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ]. Do not use tolvaptan with strong inhibitors of CYP3A [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] and avoid concomitant use with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. 5.6 Hyperkalemia or Drugs that Increase Serum Potassium Treatment with tolvaptan is associated with an acute reduction of the extracellular fluid volume which could result in increased serum potassium. Serum potassium levels should be monitored after initiation of tolvaptan treatment in patients with a serum potassium >5 mEq/L as well as those who are receiving drugs known to increase serum potassium levels. 5.7 Acute Urinary Retention with Outflow Obstruction Patients with partial obstruction of urinary outflow, for example, patients with prostatic hypertrophy or impairment of micturition, have an increased risk of developing acute retention. Do not administer tolvaptan in patients with uncorrected urinary outflow obstruction."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22655% placebo) are thirst, dry mouth, asthenia, constipation, pollakiuria or polyuria, and hyperglycemia ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Endo at 1-800-828-9393 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 ( www.fda.gov/medwatch ). 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse event information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials, 607 hyponatremic patients (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) were treated with tolvaptan. The mean age of these patients was 62 years; 70% of patients were male and 82% were Caucasian. One hundred eighty nine (189) tolvaptan-treated patients had a serum sodium <130 mEq/L, and 52 patients had a serum sodium <125 mEq/L. Hyponatremia was attributed to cirrhosis in 17% of patients, heart failure in 68% and SIADH/other in 16%. Of these patients, 223 were treated with the recommended dose titration (15 mg titrated to 60 mg as needed to raise serum sodium). Overall, over 4,000 patients have been treated with oral doses of tolvaptan in open-label or placebo-controlled clinical trials. Approximately 650 of these patients had hyponatremia; approximately 219 of these hyponatremic patients were treated with tolvaptan for 6 months or more. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655% more than placebo) seen in two 30-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled hyponatremia trials in which tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses (15 mg to 60 mg once daily) were thirst, dry mouth, asthenia, constipation, pollakiuria or polyuria and hyperglycemia. In these trials, 10% (23/223) of tolvaptan-treated patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event, compared to 12% (26/220) of placebo-treated patients; no adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of trial medication occurred at an incidence of >1% in tolvaptan-treated patients. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in tolvaptan-treated patients with hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) and at a rate at least 2% greater than placebo-treated patients in two 30-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In these studies, 223 patients were exposed to tolvaptan (starting dose 15 mg, titrated to 30 and 60 mg as needed to raise serum sodium). Adverse events resulting in death in these trials were 6% in tolvaptan-treated-patients and 6% in placebo-treated patients. Table 1.

Gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis In patients with cirrhosis treated with tolvaptan in the hyponatremia trials, gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 6 out of 63 (10%) tolvaptan-treated patients and 1 out of 57 (2%) placebo treated patients. The following adverse reactions occurred in <2% of hyponatremic patients treated with tolvaptan and at a rate greater than placebo in double-blind placebo-controlled trials (N = 607 tolvaptan; N = 518 placebo) or in <2% of patients in an uncontrolled trial of patients with hyponatremia (N = 111) and are not mentioned elsewhere in the label. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Disseminated intravascular coagulation Cardiac Disorders: Intracardiac thrombus, ventricular fibrillation Investigations: Prothrombin time prolonged Gastrointestinal Disorders: Ischemic colitis Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Diabetic ketoacidosis Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Rhabdomyolysis Nervous System: Cerebrovascular accident Renal and Urinary Disorders: Urethral hemorrhage Reproductive System and Breast Disorders (female): Vaginal hemorrhage Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders: Pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure Vascular disorder: Deep vein thrombosis 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tolvaptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Neurologic: Osmotic demyelination syndrome Investigations: Hypernatremia Removal of excess free body water increases serum osmolality and serum sodium concentrations. All patients treated with tolvaptan, especially those whose serum sodium levels become normal, should continue to be monitored to ensure serum sodium remains within normal limits. If hypernatremia is observed, management may include dose decreases or interruption of tolvaptan treatment, combined with modification of free-water intake or infusion. During clinical trials of hyponatremic patients, hypernatremia was reported as an adverse event in 0.7% of patients receiving tolvaptan vs. 0.6% of patients receiving placebo; analysis of laboratory values demonstrated an incidence of hypernatremia of 1.7% in patients receiving tolvaptan vs. 0.8% in patients receiving placebo. Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic shock and rash generalized [ see Contraindications (4.7) ]."

Larger doses of the strong CYP3A inhibitor would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. Concomitant use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors A substantial increase in the exposure to tolvaptan would be expected when tolvaptan is co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid co-administration of tolvaptan with moderate CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Patients should avoid grapefruit juice beverages while taking tolvaptan [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Strong CYP3A Inducers Co-administration of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inducers reduces exposure to tolvaptan [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Avoid concomitant use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inducers. 7.2 Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Potassium Sparing Diuretics Although specific interaction studies were not performed, in clinical studies tolvaptan was used concomitantly with beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and potassium sparing diuretics. Adverse reactions of hyperkalemia were approximately 1 to 2% higher when tolvaptan was administered with angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and potassium sparing diuretics compared to administration of these medications with placebo. Serum potassium levels should be monitored during concomitant drug therapy. 7.3 V 2 -Receptor Agonist As a V 2 -receptor antagonist, tolvaptan may interfere with the V 2 -agonist activity of desmopressin (dDAVP).

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: There are no studies ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data with tolvaptan use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Tolvaptan did not cause any developmental toxicity in rats or in rabbits at exposures approximately 2.8 and 0.8 times, respectively, the exposure in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 60 mg once daily. However, effects on embryo-fetal development occurred in both species at doses causing significant maternally toxic doses. In rats, reduced fetal weights and delayed fetal ossification occurred at 11 times the exposure in CHF patients, based on AUC. In rabbits, increased abortions, embryo-fetal death, fetal microphthalmia, open eyelids, cleft palate, brachymelia and skeletal malformations occurred at approximately 1.6 times the exposure in CHF patients (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tolvaptan during the period of organogenesis in Sprague-Dawley rats produced no evidence of teratogenesis at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. Delayed ossification was seen at 1000 mg/kg, which is approximately 11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg (AUC 24h 10271 ng*h/mL). The fetal effects are likely secondary to maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and low body weights). In a prenatal and postnatal study in rats, tolvaptan had no effect on physical development, reflex function, learning ability or reproductive performance at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg). In rabbits, teratogenicity (microphthalmia, embryo-fetal mortality, cleft palate, brachymelia and skeletal malformations) was observed in rabbits at 1000 mg/kg (approximately 1.6 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg dose). This dose also caused maternal toxicity (lower body weight gains and food consumption). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tolvaptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Tolvaptan is present in rat milk ( see Data ). When a drug is present in animal milk, it is possible that the drug will be present in human milk, but relative levels may vary (see Data). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypernatremia), hypotension, and volume depletion in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with tolvaptan. Data In lactating rats administered radiolabeled tolvaptan, lacteal radioactivity concentrations reached the highest level at 8 hours after administration and then decreased gradually with time with a half-life of 27.3 hours. The level of activity in milk ranged from 1.5-to 15.8-fold those in maternal blood over a period of 72 hours post-dose. Increased perinatal death and decreased body weight of the offspring were observed during the lactation period and after weaning at approximately 11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of tolvaptan in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of hyponatremic subjects treated with tolvaptan in clinical studies, 42% were 65 years old and over, while 19% were 75 years old and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Increasing age has no effect on tolvaptan plasma concentrations. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Moderate and severe hepatic impairment do not affect exposure to tolvaptan to a clinically relevant extent. Avoid use of tolvaptan in patients with underlying liver disease. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary based on renal function. There are no clinical trial data in patients with CrCl <10 mL/min, and, because drug effects on serum sodium levels are likely lost at very low levels of renal function, use in patients with a CrCl <10 mL/min is not recommended. No benefit can be expected in patients who are anuric [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tolvaptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Tolvaptan is present in rat milk ( see Data ). When a drug is present in animal milk, it is possible that the drug will be present in human milk, but relative levels may vary (see Data). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypernatremia), hypotension, and volume depletion in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with tolvaptan. Data In lactating rats administered radiolabeled tolvaptan, lacteal radioactivity concentrations reached the highest level at 8 hours after administration and then decreased gradually with time with a half-life of 27.3 hours. The level of activity in milk ranged from 1.5-to 15.8-fold those in maternal blood over a period of 72 hours post-dose. Increased perinatal death and decreased body weight of the offspring were observed during the lactation period and after weaning at approximately 11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Single oral doses up to 480 mg (8 times the maximum recommended daily dose) and multiple doses up to 300 mg once daily for 5 days have been well tolerated in studies in healthy subjects. There is no specific antidote for tolvaptan intoxication. The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose can be anticipated to be those of excessive pharmacologic effect: a rise in serum sodium concentration, polyuria, thirst, and dehydration/hypovolemia. No mortality was observed in rats or dogs following single oral doses of 2000 mg/kg (maximum feasible dose). A single oral dose of 2000 mg/kg was lethal in mice, and symptoms of toxicity in affected mice included decreased locomotor activity, staggering gait, tremor and hypothermia. In patients with suspected tolvaptan overdosage, assessment of vital signs, electrolyte concentrations, ECG and fluid status are recommended. Continue replacement of water and electrolytes until aquaresis abates. Dialysis may not be effective in removing tolvaptan because of its high binding affinity for human plasma protein (>98%)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolvaptan is a selective vasopressin V 2 -receptor antagonist with an affinity for the V 2 -receptor that is 1.8 times that of native arginine vasopressin (AVP). Tolvaptan affinity for the V 2 -receptor is 29 times greater than for the V 1a -receptor. When taken orally, 15 to 60 mg doses of tolvaptan antagonize the effect of vasopressin and cause an increase in urine water excretion that results in an increase in free water clearance (aquaresis), a decrease in urine osmolality, and a resulting increase in serum sodium concentrations. Urinary excretion of sodium and potassium and plasma potassium concentrations are not significantly changed. Tolvaptan metabolites have no or weak antagonist activity for human V 2 -receptors compared with tolvaptan. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In healthy subjects receiving a single dose of tolvaptan 60 mg, the onset of the aquaretic and sodium increasing effects occurs within 2 to 4 hours post-dose. A peak effect of about a 6 mEq increase in serum sodium and about 9 mL/min increase in urine excretion rate is observed between 4 and 8 hours post-dose; thus, the pharmacological activity lags behind the plasma concentrations of tolvaptan. About 60% of the peak effect on serum sodium is sustained at 24 hours post-dose, but the urinary excretion rate is no longer elevated by this time. Doses above 60 mg tolvaptan do not increase aquaresis or serum sodium further. The effects of tolvaptan in the recommended dose range of 15 to 60 mg once daily appear to be limited to aquaresis and the resulting increase in sodium concentration. Plasma concentrations of native AVP may increase (avg. 2 to 9 pg/mL) with tolvaptan administration. Cardiac Electrophysiology No prolongation of the QT interval was observed with tolvaptan following multiple doses of 300 mg/day for 5 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of tolvaptan after single doses of up to 480 mg and multiple doses up to 300 mg once daily have been examined. In hyponatremia subjects, single and multiple doses up to 60 mg have been studied. Absorption In healthy subjects, peak concentrations of tolvaptan are observed between 2 and 4 hours post-dose. Peak concentrations increase less than dose proportionally with doses greater than 240 mg. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan decreases with increasing doses. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan following an oral dose of 30 mg is 56% (range 42 to 80%). Co-administration of 90 mg tolvaptan with a high-fat meal (~1000 calories, of which 50% are from fat) doubles peak concentrations but has no effect on the AUC of tolvaptan; tolvaptan may be administered with or without food. Distribution Tolvaptan binds to both albumin and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein and the overall protein binding is >98%; binding is not affected by disease state. The volume of distribution of tolvaptan is about 3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetic properties of tolvaptan are stereospecific, with a steady-state ratio of the S-(-) to the R-(+) enantiomer of about 3. When administered as multiple once-daily 300 mg doses to healthy subjects or to patients with congestive heart failure or ADPKD, tolvaptan\u2019s accumulation factor is <1.2. There is marked inter-subject variation in peak and average exposure to tolvaptan with a percent coefficient of variation ranging between 30 and 60%. Metabolism and Elimination Tolvaptan is metabolized almost exclusively by CYP3A. Fourteen metabolites have been identified in plasma, urine and feces; all but one were also metabolized by CYP3A and none are pharmacodynamically active. After oral administration of radiolabeled tolvaptan, tolvaptan was a minor component in plasma, representing 3% of total plasma radioactivity; the oxobutyric acid metabolite was present at 52.5% of total plasma radioactivity with all other metabolites present at lower concentrations than tolvaptan. The oxobutyric acid metabolite shows a plasma half-life of ~180 h. About 40% of radioactivity was recovered in urine (<1% as unchanged tolvaptan) and 59% in feces (19% as unchanged tolvaptan). Following intravenous infusion, tolvaptan half-life is approximately 3 hours. Following single oral doses to healthy subjects, the estimated half-life of tolvaptan increases from 3 hours for a 15 mg dose to approximately 12 hours for 120 mg and higher doses due to more prolonged absorption of tolvaptan at higher doses; apparent clearance is approximately 4 mL/min/kg and does not appear to change with increasing dose. Specific Populations Hyponatremia In patients with hyponatremia of any origin the clearance of tolvaptan is reduced to about 2 mL/min/kg. Hepatic Impairment Moderate or severe hepatic impairment or congestive heart failure decrease the clearance and increase the volume of distribution of tolvaptan, but the respective changes are not clinically relevant. Exposure and response to tolvaptan in subjects with creatinine clearance ranging between 79 and 10 mL/min and patients with normal renal function are not different. Renal Impairment In a study in patients with creatinine clearances ranging from 10 to 124 mL/min administered a single dose of 60 mg tolvaptan, AUC and C max of plasma tolvaptan were less than doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) relative to the controls. The peak increase in serum sodium was 5 to 6 mEq/L, regardless of renal function, but the onset and offset of tolvaptan's effect on serum sodium were slower in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ]. Drug Interaction Studies Impact of Other Drugs on Tolvaptan Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Ketoconazole: Tolvaptan\u2019s C max and AUC were, respectively, 3.5 times and 5.4 times as high following ketoconazole 200 mg given one day prior to and concomitantly with 30 mg tolvaptan [see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors Fluconazole: Fluconazole 400 mg given one day prior and 200 mg given concomitantly produced an 80% and 200% increase in tolvaptan C max and AUC, respectively. Grapefruit Juice: Co-administration of grapefruit juice and tolvaptan results in an increase in C max and AUC of 90% and 60% for tolvaptan, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Rifampin: Rifampin 600 mg once daily for 7 days followed by a single 240 mg dose of tolvaptan decreased both tolvaptan Cmax and AUC about 85%. Other Drugs Co-administration of lovastatin, digoxin, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide with tolvaptan has no clinically relevant impact on the exposure to tolvaptan. Impact of Tolvaptan on Other Drugs CYP3A Substrates Tolvaptan is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. Co-administration of lovastatin and tolvaptan increases the exposure to lovastatin and its active metabolite lovastatin-\u03b2 hydroxyacid by factors of 1.4 and 1.3, respectively. This is not a clinically relevant change. P-gp Substrates Digoxin: Digoxin 0.25 mg was administered once daily for 12 days. Tolvaptan 60 mg, was co-administered once daily on Days 8 to 12. Digoxin C max and AUC were increased 30% and 20%, respectively. Transporter Substrates Tolvaptan is a substrate of P-gp and an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. The oxobutyric acid metabolite of tolvaptan is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OAT3. Co-administration of tolvaptan with rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) did not have a clinically significant effect on rosuvastatin exposure. Rosuvastatin C max and AUC t increased 54% and 69%, respectively. Administration of rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 substrate) or furosemide (OAT3 substrate) to healthy subjects with elevated oxobutyric acid metabolite plasma concentrations did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin or furosemide. Other Drugs Co-administration of tolvaptan does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, or amiodarone (or its active metabolite, desethylamiodarone) to a clinically significant degree."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hyponatremia In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies (SALT-1 and SALT-2), a total of 424 patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) resulting from a variety of underlying causes (heart failure, liver cirrhosis, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone [SIADH] and others) were treated for 30 days with tolvaptan or placebo, then followed for an additional 7 days after withdrawal. Symptomatic patients, patients likely to require saline therapy during the course of therapy, patients with acute and transient hyponatremia associated with head trauma or postoperative state and patients with hyponatremia due to primary polydipsia, uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency or uncontrolled hypothyroidism were excluded. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo (N = 220) or tolvaptan (N = 223) at an initial oral dose of 15 mg once daily. The mean serum sodium concentration at study entry was 129 mEq/L. Fluid restriction was to be avoided if possible during the first 24 hours of therapy to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, and during the first 24 hours of therapy 87% of patients had no fluid restriction. Thereafter, patients could resume or initiate fluid restriction (defined as daily fluid intake of \u22641.0 liter/day) as clinically indicated. The dose of tolvaptan could be increased at 24 hour intervals to 30 mg once daily, then to 60 mg once daily, until either the maximum dose of 60 mg or normonatremia (serum sodium >135 mEq/L) was reached. Serum sodium concentrations were determined at 8 hours after study drug initiation and daily up to 72 hours, within which time titration was typically completed. Treatment was maintained for 30 days with additional serum sodium assessments on Days 11, 18, 25 and 30. On the day of study discontinuation, all patients resumed previous therapies for hyponatremia and were reevaluated 7 days later. The primary endpoint for these studies was the average daily AUC for change in serum sodium from baseline to Day 4 and baseline to Day 30 in patients with a serum sodium less than 135 mEq/L. Compared to placebo, tolvaptan caused a statistically greater increase in serum sodium ( p <0.0001) during both periods in both studies (see Table 2). For patients with a serum sodium of <130 mEq/L or <125 mEq/L, the effects at Day 4 and Day 30 remained significant (see Table 2). This effect was also seen across all disease etiology subsets (e.g., CHF, cirrhosis, SIADH/other). Table 2.

Osmotic demyelination results in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma or death. In susceptible patients, including those with severe malnutrition, alcoholism or advanced liver disease, slower rates of correction may be advisable. In controlled clinical trials in which tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses starting at 15 mg once daily, 7% of tolvaptan-treated subjects with a serum sodium <130 mEq/L had an increase in serum sodium greater than 8 mEq/L at approximately 8 hours and 2% had an increase greater than 12 mEq/L at 24 hours. Approximately 1% of placebo-treated subjects with a serum sodium <130 mEq/L had a rise greater than 8 mEq/L at 8 hours and no patient had a rise greater than 12 mEq/L/24 hours. Osmotic demyelination syndrome has been reported in association with tolvaptan tablets therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Patients treated with tolvaptan tablets should be monitored to assess serum sodium concentrations and neurologic status, especially during initiation and after titration. Subjects with SIADH or very low baseline serum sodium concentrations may be at greater risk for too-rapid correction of serum sodium. In patients receiving tolvaptan tablets who develop too rapid a rise in serum sodium, discontinue or interrupt treatment with tolvaptan tablets and consider administration of hypotonic fluid. Fluid restriction during the first 24 hours of therapy with tolvaptan tablets may increase the likelihood of overly rapid correction of serum sodium and should generally be avoided. Co-administration of diuretics also increases the risk of too rapid correction of serum sodium and such patients should undergo close monitoring of serum sodium. 5.2 Liver Injury Tolvaptan can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury. In placebo-controlled studies and an open-label extension study of chronically administered tolvaptan in patients with ADPKD, cases of serious liver injury attributed to tolvaptan, generally occurring during the first 18 months of therapy, were observed. In postmarketing experience with tolvaptan in ADPKD, acute injury resulting in liver failure requiring liver transplantation has been reported. Tolvaptan should not be used to treat ADPKD outside of the FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for ADPKD patients [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Patients with symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice should discontinue treatment with tolvaptan tablets. Limit duration of therapy with tolvaptan tablets to 30 days. Avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease, including cirrhosis, because the ability to recover from liver injury may be impaired [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.3 Dehydration and Hypovolemia Tolvaptan tablets therapy induces copious aquaresis, which is normally partially offset by fluid intake. Dehydration and hypovolemia can occur, especially in potentially volume-depleted patients receiving diuretics or those who are fluid restricted. In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials in which 607 hyponatremic patients were treated with tolvaptan, the incidence of dehydration was 3.3% for tolvaptan and 1.5% for placebo-treated patients. In patients receiving tolvaptan tablets who develop medically significant signs or symptoms of hypovolemia, interrupt or discontinue tolvaptan tablets therapy and provide supportive care with careful management of vital signs, fluid balance and electrolytes. Fluid restriction during therapy with tolvaptan tablets may increase the risk of dehydration and hypovolemia. Patients receiving tolvaptan tablets should continue ingestion of fluid in response to thirst. 5.4 Co-administration with Hypertonic Saline Concomitant use with hypertonic saline is not recommended. 5.5 Drug Interactions Tolvaptan is a substrate of CYP3A. Moderate to strong CYP3A inhibitors can lead to a marked increase in tolvaptan concentrations [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Do not use tolvaptan tablets with strong inhibitors of CYP3A [see Contraindications ( 4 )] and avoid concomitant use with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. 5.6 Hyperkalemia or Drugs that Increase Serum Potassium Treatment with tolvaptan is associated with an acute reduction of the extracellular fluid volume which could result in increased serum potassium. Serum potassium levels should be monitored after initiation of tolvaptan treatment in patients with a serum potassium >5 mEq/L as well as those who are receiving drugs known to increase serum potassium levels. 5.7 Acute Urinary Retention with Outflow Obstruction Patients with partial obstruction of urinary outflow, for example, patients with prostatic hypertrophy or impairment of micturition, have an increased risk of developing acute retention. Do not administer tolvaptan in patients with uncorrected urinary outflow obstruction."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22655% placebo) are thirst, dry mouth, asthenia, constipation, pollakiuria or polyuria, and hyperglycemia ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Annora Pharma Private Limited at 1-866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 ( www.fda.gov/medwatch) . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse event information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials, 607 hyponatremic patients (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) were treated with tolvaptan tablets. The mean age of these patients was 62 years; 70% of patients were male and 82% were Caucasian. One hundred eighty-nine (189) tolvaptan-treated patients had a serum sodium <130 mEq/L, and 52 patients had a serum sodium <125 mEq/L. Hyponatremia was attributed to cirrhosis in 17% of patients, heart failure in 68% and SIADH/other in 16%. Of these patients, 223 were treated with the recommended dose titration (15 mg titrated to 60 mg as needed to raise serum sodium). Overall, over 4,000 patients have been treated with oral doses of tolvaptan in open-label or placebo-controlled clinical trials. Approximately 650 of these patients had hyponatremia; approximately 219 of these hyponatremic patients were treated with tolvaptan for 6 months or more. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655% more than placebo) seen in two 30-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled hyponatremia trials in which tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses (15 mg to 60 mg once daily) were thirst, dry mouth, asthenia, constipation, pollakiuria or polyuria and hyperglycemia. In these trials, 10% (23/223) of tolvaptan-treated patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event, compared to 12% (26/220) of placebo-treated patients; no adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of trial medication occurred at an incidence of >1% in tolvaptan-treated patients. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in tolvaptan-treated patients with hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) and at a rate at least 2% greater than placebo-treated patients in two 30-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In these studies, 223 patients were exposed to tolvaptan (starting dose 15 mg, titrated to 30 and 60 mg as needed to raise serum sodium). Adverse events resulting in death in these trials were 6% in tolvaptan-treated patients and 6% in placebo-treated patients. Table 1.

Gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis In patients with cirrhosis treated with tolvaptan in the hyponatremia trials, gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 6 out of 63 (10%) tolvaptan-treated patients and 1 out of 57 (2%) placebo treated patients. The following adverse reactions occurred in <2% of hyponatremic patients treated with tolvaptan tablets and at a rate greater than placebo in double-blind placebo-controlled trials (N = 607 tolvaptan; N = 518 placebo) or in <2% of patients in an uncontrolled trial of patients with hyponatremia (N = 111) and are not mentioned elsewhere in the label.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Neurologic: Osmotic demyelination syndrome Investigations: Hypernatremia Removal of excess free body water increases serum osmolality and serum sodium concentrations. All patients treated with tolvaptan, especially those whose serum sodium levels become normal, should continue to be monitored to ensure serum sodium remains within normal limits. If hypernatremia is observed, management may include dose decreases or interruption of tolvaptan treatment, combined with modification of free-water intake or infusion. During clinical trials of hyponatremic patients, hypernatremia was reported as an adverse event in 0.7% of patients receiving tolvaptan vs. 0.6% of patients receiving placebo; analysis of laboratory values demonstrated an incidence of hypernatremia of 1.7% in patients receiving tolvaptan vs. 0.8% in patients receiving placebo.

Larger doses of the strong CYP3A inhibitor would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. Concomitant use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors A substantial increase in the exposure to tolvaptan would be expected when tolvaptan is co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid co-administration of tolvaptan with moderate CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Patients should avoid grapefruit juice beverages while taking tolvaptan [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Strong CYP3A Inducers Co-administration of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inducers reduces exposure to tolvaptan [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Avoid concomitant use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inducers. 7.2 Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Potassium Sparing Diuretics Although specific interaction studies were not performed, in clinical studies, tolvaptan was used concomitantly with beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and potassium sparing diuretics. Adverse reactions of hyperkalemia were approximately 1 to 2% higher when tolvaptan was administered with angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and potassium sparing diuretics compared to administration of these medications with placebo. Serum potassium levels should be monitored during concomitant drug therapy. 7.3 V 2 -Receptor Agonist As a V 2 -receptor antagonist, tolvaptan may interfere with the V 2 -agonist activity of desmopressin (dDAVP).

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) \u2022 Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) \u2022 Pediatric Use: There are no studies ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data with tolvaptan use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Tolvaptan did not cause any developmental toxicity in rats or in rabbits at exposures approximately 2.8 and 0.8 times, respectively, the exposure in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 60 mg once daily. However, effects on embryo-fetal development occurred in both species at doses causing significant maternally toxic doses. In rats, reduced fetal weights and delayed fetal ossification occurred at 11 times the exposure in CHF patients, based on AUC. In rabbits, increased abortions, embryo-fetal death, fetal microphthalmia, open eyelids, cleft palate, brachymelia and skeletal malformations occurred at approximately 1.6 times the exposure in CHF patients (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tolvaptan during the period of organogenesis in Sprague-Dawley rats produced no evidence of teratogenesis at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. Delayed ossification was seen at 1000 mg/kg, which is approximately 11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg (AUC 24h 10271 ng*h/mL). The fetal effects are likely secondary to maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and low body weights). In a prenatal and postnatal study in rats, tolvaptan had no effect on physical development, reflex function, learning ability or reproductive performance at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg). In rabbits, teratogenicity (microphthalmia, embryo-fetal mortality, cleft palate, brachymelia and skeletal malformations) was observed in rabbits at 1000 mg/kg (approximately 1.6 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg dose). This dose also caused maternal toxicity (lower body weight gains and food consumption). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tolvaptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Tolvaptan is present in rat milk ( see Data ). When a drug is present in animal milk, it is possible that the drug will be present in human milk, but relative levels may vary ( see Data ). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypernatremia), hypotension, and volume depletion in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with tolvaptan. Data In lactating rats administered radiolabeled tolvaptan, lacteal radioactivity concentrations reached the highest level at 8 hours after administration and then decreased gradually with time with a half-life of 27.3 hours. The level of activity in milk ranged from 1.5- to 15.8-fold those in maternal blood over a period of 72 hours post-dose. Increased perinatal death and decreased body weight of the offspring were observed during the lactation period and after weaning at approximately 11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of tolvaptan tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of hyponatremic subjects treated with tolvaptan tablets in clinical studies, 42% were 65 years old and over, while 19% were 75 years old and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Increasing age has no effect on tolvaptan plasma concentrations. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Moderate and severe hepatic impairment do not affect exposure to tolvaptan to a clinically relevant extent. Avoid use of tolvaptan in patients with underlying liver disease. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary based on renal function. There are no clinical trial data in patients with CrCl <10 mL/min, and, because drug effects on serum sodium levels are likely lost at very low levels of renal function, use in patients with a CrCl <10 mL/min is not recommended. No benefit can be expected in patients who are anuric [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

There is no specific antidote for tolvaptan intoxication. The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose can be anticipated to be those of excessive pharmacologic effect: a rise in serum sodium concentration, polyuria, thirst, and dehydration/hypovolemia. No mortality was observed in rats or dogs following single oral doses of 2000 mg/kg (maximum feasible dose). A single oral dose of 2000 mg/kg was lethal in mice, and symptoms of toxicity in affected mice included decreased locomotor activity, staggering gait, tremor and hypothermia. In patients with suspected tolvaptan overdosage, assessment of vital signs, electrolyte concentrations, ECG and fluid status are recommended.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolvaptan is a selective vasopressin V 2 -receptor antagonist with an affinity for the V 2 -receptor that is 1.8 times that of native arginine vasopressin (AVP). Tolvaptan affinity for the V 2 -receptor is 29 times greater than for the V 1a -receptor. When taken orally, 15 to 60 mg doses of tolvaptan antagonize the effect of vasopressin and cause an increase in urine water excretion that results in an increase in free water clearance (aquaresis), a decrease in urine osmolality, and a resulting increase in serum sodium concentrations. Urinary excretion of sodium and potassium and plasma potassium concentrations are not significantly changed. Tolvaptan metabolites have no or weak antagonist activity for human V 2 -receptors compared with tolvaptan. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In healthy subjects receiving a single dose of tolvaptan tablets 60 mg, the onset of the aquaretic and sodium increasing effects occurs within 2 to 4 hours post-dose. A peak effect of about a 6 mEq increase in serum sodium and about 9 mL/min increase in urine excretion rate is observed between 4 and 8 hours post-dose; thus, the pharmacological activity lags behind the plasma concentrations of tolvaptan. About 60% of the peak effect on serum sodium is sustained at 24 hours post-dose, but the urinary excretion rate is no longer elevated by this time. Doses above 60 mg tolvaptan do not increase aquaresis or serum sodium further. The effects of tolvaptan in the recommended dose range of 15 to 60 mg once daily appear to be limited to aquaresis and the resulting increase in sodium concentration. Plasma concentrations of native AVP may increase (avg. 2 to 9 pg/mL) with tolvaptan administration. Cardiac Electrophysiology No prolongation of the QT interval was observed with tolvaptan following multiple doses of 300 mg/day for 5 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of tolvaptan after single doses of up to 480 mg and multiple doses up to 300 mg once daily have been examined. In hyponatremia subjects, single and multiple doses up to 60 mg have been studied. Absorption In healthy subjects, peak concentrations of tolvaptan are observed between 2 and 4 hours post-dose. Peak concentrations increase less than dose proportionally with doses greater than 240 mg. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan decreases with increasing doses. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan following an oral dose of 30 mg is 56% (range 42 to 80%). Co-administration of 90 mg tolvaptan with a high-fat meal (~1000 calories, of which 50% are from fat) doubles peak concentrations but has no effect on the AUC of tolvaptan; tolvaptan may be administered with or without food. Distribution Tolvaptan binds to both albumin and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein and the overall protein binding is >98%; binding is not affected by disease state. The volume of distribution of tolvaptan is about 3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetic properties of tolvaptan are stereospecific, with a steady-state ratio of the S-(-) to the R-(+) enantiomer of about 3. When administered as multiple once-daily 300 mg doses to healthy subjects or to patients with congestive heart failure or ADPKD, tolvaptan\u2019s accumulation factor is <1.2. There is marked inter-subject variation in peak and average exposure to tolvaptan with a percent coefficient of variation ranging between 30 and 60%. Metabolism and Elimination Tolvaptan is metabolized almost exclusively by CYP3A. Fourteen metabolites have been identified in plasma, urine and feces; all but one were also metabolized by CYP3A and none are pharmacodynamically active. After oral administration of radiolabeled tolvaptan, tolvaptan was a minor component in plasma, representing 3% of total plasma radioactivity; the oxobutyric acid metabolite was present at 52.5% of total plasma radioactivity with all other metabolites present at lower concentrations than tolvaptan. The oxobutyric acid metabolite shows a plasma half-life of ~180 h. About 40% of radioactivity was recovered in urine (<1% as unchanged tolvaptan) and 59% in feces (19% as unchanged tolvaptan). Following intravenous infusion, tolvaptan half-life is approximately 3 hours. Following single oral doses to healthy subjects, the estimated half-life of tolvaptan increases from 3 hours for a 15 mg dose to approximately 12 hours for 120 mg and higher doses due to more prolonged absorption of tolvaptan at higher doses; apparent clearance is approximately 4 mL/min/kg and does not appear to change with increasing dose. Specific Populations Hyponatremia In patients with hyponatremia of any origin the clearance of tolvaptan is reduced to about 2 mL/min/kg. Hepatic Impairment Moderate or severe hepatic impairment or congestive heart failure decrease the clearance and increase the volume of distribution of tolvaptan, but the respective changes are not clinically relevant. Exposure and response to tolvaptan in subjects with creatinine clearance ranging between 79 and 10 mL/min and patients with normal renal function are not different. Renal Impairment In a study in patients with creatinine clearances ranging from 10 to 124 mL/min administered a single dose of 60 mg tolvaptan, AUC and C max of plasma tolvaptan were less than doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) relative to the controls. The peak increase in serum sodium was 5 to 6 mEq/L, regardless of renal function, but the onset and offset of tolvaptan's effect on serum sodium were slower in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug Interaction Studies Impact of Other Drugs on Tolvaptan Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Ketoconazole: Tolvaptan\u2019s C max and AUC were, respectively, 3.5 times and 5.4 times as high following ketoconazole 200 mg given one day prior to and concomitantly with 30 mg tolvaptan [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors Fluconazole: Fluconazole 400 mg given one day prior and 200 mg given concomitantly produced an 80% and 200% increase in tolvaptan C max and AUC, respectively. Grapefruit Juice: Co-administration of grapefruit juice and tolvaptan results in an increase in C max and AUC of 90% and 60% for tolvaptan, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . CYP3A4 Inducers Rifampin: Rifampin 600 mg once daily for 7 days followed by a single 240 mg dose of tolvaptan decreased both tolvaptan C max and AUC about 85%. Other Drugs Co-administration of lovastatin, digoxin, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide with tolvaptan has no clinically relevant impact on the exposure to tolvaptan. Impact of Tolvaptan on Other Drugs CYP3A Substrates Tolvaptan is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. Co-administration of lovastatin and tolvaptan increases the exposure to lovastatin and its active metabolite lovastatin-\u03b2 hydroxyacid by factors of 1.4 and 1.3, respectively. This is not a clinically relevant change. P-gp Substrates Digoxin: Digoxin 0.25 mg was administered once daily for 12 days. Tolvaptan 60 mg, was co-administered once daily on Days 8 to 12. Digoxin C max and AUC were increased 30% and 20%, respectively. Transporter Substrates Tolvaptan is a substrate of P-gp and an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. The oxobutyric acid metabolite of tolvaptan is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OAT3. Co-administration of tolvaptan with rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) did not have a clinically significant effect on rosuvastatin exposure. Rosuvastatin C max and AUC t increased 54% and 69%, respectively. Administration of rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 substrate) or furosemide (OAT3 substrate) to healthy subjects with elevated oxobutyric acid metabolite plasma concentrations did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin or furosemide. Other Drugs Co-administration of tolvaptan does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, or amiodarone (or its active metabolite, desethylamiodarone) to a clinically significant degree."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolvaptan is a selective vasopressin V 2 -receptor antagonist with an affinity for the V 2 -receptor that is 1.8 times that of native arginine vasopressin (AVP). Tolvaptan affinity for the V 2 -receptor is 29 times greater than for the V 1a -receptor. When taken orally, 15 to 60 mg doses of tolvaptan antagonize the effect of vasopressin and cause an increase in urine water excretion that results in an increase in free water clearance (aquaresis), a decrease in urine osmolality, and a resulting increase in serum sodium concentrations. Urinary excretion of sodium and potassium and plasma potassium concentrations are not significantly changed. Tolvaptan metabolites have no or weak antagonist activity for human V 2 -receptors compared with tolvaptan."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In healthy subjects receiving a single dose of tolvaptan tablets 60 mg, the onset of the aquaretic and sodium increasing effects occurs within 2 to 4 hours post-dose. A peak effect of about a 6 mEq increase in serum sodium and about 9 mL/min increase in urine excretion rate is observed between 4 and 8 hours post-dose; thus, the pharmacological activity lags behind the plasma concentrations of tolvaptan. About 60% of the peak effect on serum sodium is sustained at 24 hours post-dose, but the urinary excretion rate is no longer elevated by this time. Doses above 60 mg tolvaptan do not increase aquaresis or serum sodium further. The effects of tolvaptan in the recommended dose range of 15 to 60 mg once daily appear to be limited to aquaresis and the resulting increase in sodium concentration. Plasma concentrations of native AVP may increase (avg. 2 to 9 pg/mL) with tolvaptan administration. Cardiac Electrophysiology No prolongation of the QT interval was observed with tolvaptan following multiple doses of 300 mg/day for 5 days."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of tolvaptan after single doses of up to 480 mg and multiple doses up to 300 mg once daily have been examined. In hyponatremia subjects, single and multiple doses up to 60 mg have been studied. Absorption In healthy subjects, peak concentrations of tolvaptan are observed between 2 and 4 hours post-dose. Peak concentrations increase less than dose proportionally with doses greater than 240 mg. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan decreases with increasing doses. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan following an oral dose of 30 mg is 56% (range 42 to 80%). Co-administration of 90 mg tolvaptan with a high-fat meal (~1000 calories, of which 50% are from fat) doubles peak concentrations but has no effect on the AUC of tolvaptan; tolvaptan may be administered with or without food.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hyponatremia In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies (SALT-1 and SALT-2), a total of 424 patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) resulting from a variety of underlying causes (heart failure, liver cirrhosis, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone [SIADH] and others) were treated for 30 days with tolvaptan or placebo, then followed for an additional 7 days after withdrawal. Symptomatic patients, patients likely to require saline therapy during the course of therapy, patients with acute and transient hyponatremia associated with head trauma or postoperative state and patients with hyponatremia due to primary polydipsia, uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency or uncontrolled hypothyroidism were excluded. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo (N = 220) or tolvaptan (N = 223) at an initial oral dose of 15 mg once daily. The mean serum sodium concentration at study entry was 129 mEq/L. Fluid restriction was to be avoided if possible during the first 24 hours of therapy to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, and during the first 24 hours of therapy 87% of patients had no fluid restriction. Thereafter, patients could resume or initiate fluid restriction (defined as daily fluid intake of \u22641.0 liter/day) as clinically indicated. The dose of tolvaptan could be increased at 24-hour intervals to 30 mg once daily, then to 60 mg once daily, until either the maximum dose of 60 mg or normonatremia (serum sodium >135 mEq/L) was reached. Serum sodium concentrations were determined at 8 hours after study drug initiation and daily up to 72 hours, within which time titration was typically completed. Treatment was maintained for 30 days with additional serum sodium assessments on Days 11, 18, 25 and 30. On the day of study discontinuation, all patients resumed previous therapies for hyponatremia and were reevaluated 7 days later. The primary endpoint for these studies was the average daily AUC for change in serum sodium from baseline to Day 4 and baseline to Day 30 in patients with a serum sodium less than 135 mEq/L. Compared to placebo, tolvaptan caused a statistically greater increase in serum sodium ( p <0.0001) during both periods in both studies (see Table 2). For patients with a serum sodium of <130 mEq/L or <125 mEq/L, the effects at Day 4 and Day 30 remained significant (see Table 2). This effect was also seen across all disease etiology subsets (e.g., CHF, cirrhosis, SIADH/other). Table 2.

In patients with hyponatremia (defined as <135 mEq/L), serum sodium concentration increased to a significantly greater degree in tolvaptan-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients as early as 8 hours after the first dose, and the change was maintained for 30 days. The percentage of patients requiring fluid restriction (defined as \u22641 L/day at any time during the treatment period) was also significantly less ( p =0.0017) in the tolvaptan-treated group (30/215, 14%) as compared with the placebo-treated group (51/206, 25%). Figure 1 shows the change from baseline in serum sodium by visit in patients with serum sodium <135 mEq/L.

By this time, their baseline mean serum sodium concentration had fallen to between their original baseline and post-placebo therapy level. Upon initiation of therapy, average serum sodium concentrations increased to approximately the same levels as observed for those previously treated with tolvaptan and were sustained for at least a year. Figure 3 shows results from 111 patients enrolled in the SALTWATER Study.

      "MEDICATION GUIDE Tolvaptan Tablets (tol-VAP-tan ) Read the Medication Guide that comes with tolvaptan tablets before you take them and each time you get a new prescription. There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Share this important information with members of your household. What is the most important information I should know about tolvaptan tablets? 1) Tolvaptan tablets may make the salt (sodium) level in your blood rise too fast. This can increase your risk of a serious condition called osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). ODS can lead to coma or death. ODS can also cause new symptoms such as: \u2022 trouble speaking \u2022 swallowing trouble or feeling like food or liquid gets stuck while swallowing \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 confusion \u2022 mood changes \u2022 trouble controlling body movement (involuntary movement) and weakness in muscles of the arms and legs \u2022 seizures You or a family member should tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms even if they begin later in treatment. Also tell your healthcare provider about any other new symptoms while taking tolvaptan tablets. You may be more at risk for ODS if you have: \u2022 liver disease \u2022 not eaten enough for a long period of time (malnourished) \u2022 very low sodium level in your blood \u2022 been drinking large amounts of alcohol for a long period of time (chronic alcoholism) To lessen your risk of ODS while taking tolvaptan tablets: \u2022 Treatment with tolvaptan tablets should be started and re-started only in a hospital, where the sodium levels in your blood can be checked closely. \u2022 Do not take tolvaptan tablets if you cannot tell if you are thirsty. \u2022 To prevent losing too much body water (dehydration), have water available to drink at all times while taking tolvaptan tablets. Unless your healthcare provider tells you otherwise, drink when you are thirsty. \u2022 If your healthcare provider tells you to keep taking tolvaptan tablets after you leave a hospital, it is important that you do not stop and re-start tolvaptan tablets on your own. You may need to go back to a hospital to re-start tolvaptan tablets. Talk to your healthcare provider right away if you stop taking tolvaptan tablets for any reason. \u2022 It is important to stay under the care of your healthcare provider while taking tolvaptan tablets and follow their instructions. 2) Tolvaptan tablets may cause liver problems, including life-threatening liver failure. Tolvaptan tablets should not be taken for more than 30 days. Tell your doctor right away if you develop or have worsening of any of these signs and symptoms of liver problems: \u2022 Loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting \u2022 Fever, feeling unwell, unusual tiredness \u2022 Itching \u2022 Yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice) \u2022 Unusual darkening of the urine \u2022 Right upper stomach area pain or discomfort 3) If you have autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), do not use tolvaptan tablets because you should receive the medicine (tolvaptan) through a program that ensures laboratory monitoring of your liver. What are tolvaptan tablets? Tolvaptan tablets are a prescription medicine used to help increase low sodium levels in the blood, in adults with conditions such as heart failure, and certain hormone imbalances.

Dosage may be increased at intervals \u226524 hr to 30 mg once daily, and to a maximum of 60 mg once daily as needed to raise serum sodium. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Patients should be in a hospital for initiation and re-initiation of therapy to evaluate the therapeutic response and because too rapid correction of hyponatremia can cause osmotic demyelination resulting in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma and death. The usual starting dose for tolvaptan tablets is 15 mg administered once daily without regard to meals. Increase the dose to 30 mg once daily, after at least 24 hours, to a maximum of 60 mg once daily, as needed to achieve the desired level of serum sodium. Do not administer tolvaptan tablets for more than 30 days to minimize the risk of liver injury [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. During initiation and titration, frequently monitor for changes in serum electrolytes and volume. Avoid fluid restriction during the first 24 hours of therapy. Patients receiving tolvaptan tablets should be advised that they can continue ingestion of fluid in response to thirst [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 2.2 Drug Withdrawal Following discontinuation from tolvaptan tablets, patients should be advised to resume fluid restriction and should be monitored for changes in serum sodium and volume status."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Liver injury: Limit treatment duration to 30 days. If hepatic injury is suspected, discontinue tolvaptan. Avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease ( 5.2 ) Dehydration and hypovolemia may require intervention ( 5.3 ) Avoid use with hypertonic saline ( 5.4 ) Avoid use with moderate to strong CYP3A inhibitors ( 5.5 ) Monitor serum potassium in patients with potassium >5 mEq/L or on drugs known to increase potassium ( 5.6 ) Urinary outflow obstruction: Urinary output must be secured ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Too Rapid Correction of Serum Sodium Can Cause Serious Neurologic Sequelae Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a risk associated with too rapid correction of hyponatremia (e.g.,>12 mEq/L/24 hours). Osmotic demyelination results in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma or death. In susceptible patients, including those with severe malnutrition, alcoholism or advanced liver disease, slower rates of correction may be advisable. In controlled clinical trials in which tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses starting at 15 mg once daily, 7% of tolvaptan-\u00adtreated subjects with a serum sodium <130 mEq/L had an increase in serum sodium greater than 8 mEq/L at approximately 8 hours and 2% had an increase greater than 12 mEq/L at 24 hours. Approximately 1% of placebo-treated subjects with a serum sodium <130 mEq/L had a rise greater than 8 mEq/L at 8 hours and no patient had a rise greater than 12 mEq/L/24 hours. Osmotic demyelination syndrome has been reported in association with tolvaptan therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Patients treated with tolvaptan should be monitored to assess serum sodium concentrations and neurologic status, especially during initiation and after titration. Subjects with SIADH or very low baseline serum sodium concentrations may be at greater risk for too-rapid correction of serum sodium. In patients receiving tolvaptan who develop too rapid a rise in serum sodium, discontinue or interrupt treatment with tolvaptan and consider administration of hypotonic fluid. Fluid restriction during the first 24 hours of therapy with tolvaptan may increase the likelihood of overly rapid correction of serum sodium and should generally be avoided. Co-administration of diuretics also increases the risk of too rapid correction of serum sodium and such patients should undergo close monitoring of serum sodium. 5.2 Liver Injury Tolvaptan can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury. In placebo-controlled studies and an open-label extension study of chronically administered tolvaptan in patients with ADPKD, cases of serious liver injury attributed to tolvaptan, generally occurring during the first 18 months of therapy, were observed. In postmarketing experience with tolvaptan in ADPKD, acute injury resulting in liver failure requiring liver transplantation has been reported. Tolvaptan should not be used to treat ADPKD outside of the FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for ADPKD patients [see Contraindications (4) ]. Patients with symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice should discontinue treatment with tolvaptan. Limit duration of therapy with tolvaptan to 30 days. Avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease, including cirrhosis, because the ability to recover from liver injury may be impaired [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.3 Dehydration and Hypovolemia Tolvaptan therapy induces copious aquaresis, which is normally partially offset by fluid intake. Dehydration and hypovolemia can occur, especially in potentially volume-depleted patients receiving diuretics or those who are fluid restricted. In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials in which 607 hyponatremic patients were treated with tolvaptan, the incidence of dehydration was 3.3% for tolvaptan and 1.5% for placebo-treated patients. In patients receiving tolvaptan who develop medically significant signs or symptoms of hypovolemia, interrupt or discontinue tolvaptan therapy and provide supportive care with careful management of vital signs, fluid balance and electrolytes. Fluid restriction during therapy with tolvaptan may increase the risk of dehydration and hypovolemia. Patients receiving tolvaptan should continue ingestion of fluid in response to thirst. 5.4 Co-administration with Hypertonic Saline Concomitant use with hypertonic saline is not recommended. 5.5 Drug Interactions Tolvaptan is a substrate of CYP3A. Moderate to strong CYP3A inhibitors can lead to a marked increase in tolvaptan concentrations [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Do not use tolvaptan with strong inhibitors of CYP3A [see Contraindications (4) ] and avoid concomitant use with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. 5.6 Hyperkalemia or Drugs that Increase Serum Potassium Treatment with tolvaptan is associated with an acute reduction of the extracellular fluid volume which could result in increased serum potassium. Serum potassium levels should be monitored after initiation of tolvaptan treatment in patients with a serum potassium >5 mEq/L as well as those who are receiving drugs known to increase serum potassium levels. 5.7 Acute Urinary Retention with Outflow Obstruction Patients with partial obstruction of urinary outflow, for example, patients with prostatic hypertrophy or impairment of micturition, have an increased risk of developing acute retention. Do not administer tolvaptan in patients with uncorrected urinary outflow obstruction."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22655% placebo) are thirst, dry mouth, asthenia, constipation, pollakiuria or polyuria, and hyperglycemia ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novadoz Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-855-668-2369 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse event information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials, 607 hyponatremic patients (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) were treated with tolvaptan. The mean age of these patients was 62 years; 70% of patients were male and 82% were Caucasian. One hundred eighty-nine (189) tolvaptan-treated patients had a serum sodium <130 mEq/L, and 52 patients had a serum sodium <125 mEq/L. Hyponatremia was attributed to cirrhosis in 17% of patients, heart failure in 68% and SIADH/other in 16%. Of these patients, 223 were treated with the recommended dose titration (15 mg titrated to 60 mg as needed to raise serum sodium). Overall, over 4,000 patients have been treated with oral doses of tolvaptan in open-label or placebo-controlled clinical trials. Approximately 650 of these patients had hyponatremia; approximately 219 of these hyponatremic patients were treated with tolvaptan for 6 months or more. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655% more than placebo) seen in two 30-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled hyponatremia trials in which tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses (15 mg to 60 mg once daily) were thirst, dry mouth, asthenia, constipation, pollakiuria or polyuria and hyperglycemia. In these trials, 10% (23/223) of tolvaptan-treated patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event, compared to 12% (26/220) of placebo-treated patients; no adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of trial medication occurred at an incidence of >1% in tolvaptan-treated patients. 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in tolvaptan-treated patients with hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) and at a rate at least 2% greater than placebo-treated patients in two 30-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In these studies, 223 patients were exposed to tolvaptan (starting dose 15 mg, titrated to 30 and 60 mg as needed to raise serum sodium). Adverse events resulting in death in these trials were 6% in tolvaptan-treated patients and 6% in placebo-treated patients. Table 1.

Gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis In patients with cirrhosis treated with tolvaptan in the hyponatremia trials, gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 6 out of 63 (10%) tolvaptan-treated patients and 1 out of 57 (2%) placebo treated patients. The following adverse reactions occurred in <2% of hyponatremic patients treated with tolvaptan and at a rate greater than placebo in double-blind placebo-controlled trials (N = 607 tolvaptan; N = 518 placebo) or in <2% of patients in an uncontrolled trial of patients with hyponatremia (N = 111) and are not mentioned elsewhere in the label.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Neurologic: Osmotic demyelination syndrome Investigations: Hypernatremia Removal of excess free body water increases serum osmolality and serum sodium concentrations. All patients treated with tolvaptan, especially those whose serum sodium levels become normal, should continue to be monitored to ensure serum sodium remains within normal limits. If hypernatremia is observed, management may include dose decreases or interruption of tolvaptan treatment, combined with modification of free-water intake or infusion. During clinical trials of hyponatremic patients, hypernatremia was reported as an adverse event in 0.7% of patients receiving tolvaptan vs. 0.6% of patients receiving placebo; analysis of laboratory values demonstrated an incidence of hypernatremia of 1.7% in patients receiving tolvaptan vs. 0.8% in patients receiving placebo.

Larger doses of the strong CYP3A inhibitor would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. Concomitant use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors A substantial increase in the exposure to tolvaptan would be expected when tolvaptan is co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid co-administration of tolvaptan with moderate CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . Patients should avoid grapefruit juice beverages while taking tolvaptan [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm (8.1) Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended (8.2) Pediatric Use: There are no studies (8.4) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data with tolvaptan use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Tolvaptan did not cause any developmental toxicity in rats or in rabbits at exposures approximately 2.8 and 0.8 times, respectively, the exposure in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 60 mg once daily. However, effects on embryo-fetal development occurred in both species at doses causing significant maternally toxic doses. In rats, reduced fetal weights and delayed fetal ossification occurred at 11 times the exposure in CHF patients, based on AUC. In rabbits, increased abortions, embryo-fetal death, fetal microphthalmia, open eyelids, cleft palate, brachymelia and skeletal malformations occurred at approximately 1.6 times the exposure in CHF patients (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tolvaptan during the period of organogenesis in Sprague-Dawley rats produced no evidence of teratogenesis at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. Delayed ossification was seen at 1000 mg/kg, which is approximately 11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg (AUC 24h 10271 ng*h/mL). The fetal effects are likely secondary to maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and low body weights). In a prenatal and postnatal study in rats, tolvaptan had no effect on physical development, reflex function, learning ability or reproductive performance at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg). In rabbits, teratogenicity (microphthalmia, embryo-fetal mortality, cleft palate, brachymelia and skeletal malformations) was observed in rabbits at 1000 mg/kg (approximately 1.6 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg dose). This dose also caused maternal toxicity (lower body weight gains and food consumption). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tolvaptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Tolvaptan is present in rat milk (see Data) . When a drug is present in animal milk, it is possible that the drug will be present in human milk, but relative levels may vary (see Data) . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypernatremia), hypotension, and volume depletion in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with tolvaptan. Data In lactating rats administered radiolabeled tolvaptan, lacteal radioactivity concentrations reached the highest level at 8 hours after administration and then decreased gradually with time with a half-life of 27.3 hours. The level of activity in milk ranged from 1.5- to 15.8-fold those in maternal blood over a period of 72 hours post-dose. Increased perinatal death and decreased body weight of the offspring were observed during the lactation period and after weaning at approximately 11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of tolvaptan in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of hyponatremic subjects treated with tolvaptan in clinical studies, 42% were 65 years old and over, while 19% were 75 years old and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Increasing age has no effect on tolvaptan plasma concentrations. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Moderate and severe hepatic impairment do not affect exposure to tolvaptan to a clinically relevant extent. Avoid use of tolvaptan in patients with underlying liver disease. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary based on renal function. There are no clinical trial data in patients with CrCl <10 mL/min, and, because drug effects on serum sodium levels are likely lost at very low levels of renal function, use in patients with a CrCl <10 mL/min is not recommended. No benefit can be expected in patients who are anuric [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolvaptan is a selective vasopressin V 2 -receptor antagonist with an affinity for the V 2 -receptor that is 1.8 times that of native arginine vasopressin (AVP). Tolvaptan affinity for the V 2 -receptor is 29 times greater than for the V 1a -receptor. When taken orally, 15 to 60 mg doses of tolvaptan antagonize the effect of vasopressin and cause an increase in urine water excretion that results in an increase in free water clearance (aquaresis), a decrease in urine osmolality, and a resulting increase in serum sodium concentrations. Urinary excretion of sodium and potassium and plasma potassium concentrations are not significantly changed. Tolvaptan metabolites have no or weak antagonist activity for human V 2 -receptors compared with tolvaptan. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In healthy subjects receiving a single dose of tolvaptan 60 mg, the onset of the aquaretic and sodium increasing effects occurs within 2 to 4 hours post-dose. A peak effect of about a 6 mEq increase in serum sodium and about 9 mL/min increase in urine excretion rate is observed between 4 and 8 hours post-dose; thus, the pharmacological activity lags behind the plasma concentrations of tolvaptan. About 60% of the peak effect on serum sodium is sustained at 24 hours post-dose, but the urinary excretion rate is no longer elevated by this time. Doses above 60 mg tolvaptan do not increase aquaresis or serum sodium further. The effects of tolvaptan in the recommended dose range of 15 to 60 mg once daily appear to be limited to aquaresis and the resulting increase in sodium concentration. Plasma concentrations of native AVP may increase (avg. 2 to 9 pg/mL) with tolvaptan administration. Cardiac Electrophysiology No prolongation of the QT interval was observed with tolvaptan following multiple doses of 300 mg/day for 5 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of tolvaptan after single doses of up to 480 mg and multiple doses up to 300 mg once daily have been examined. In hyponatremia subjects, single and multiple doses up to 60 mg have been studied. Absorption In healthy subjects, peak concentrations of tolvaptan are observed between 2 and 4 hours post-dose. Peak concentrations increase less than dose proportionally with doses greater than 240 mg. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan decreases with increasing doses. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan following an oral dose of 30 mg is 56% (range 42 to 80%). Co-administration of 90 mg tolvaptan with a high-fat meal (~1000 calories, of which 50% are from fat) doubles peak concentrations but has no effect on the AUC of tolvaptan; tolvaptan may be administered with or without food. Distribution Tolvaptan binds to both albumin and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein and the overall protein binding is >98%; binding is not affected by disease state. The volume of distribution of tolvaptan is about 3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetic properties of tolvaptan are stereospecific, with a steady-state ratio of the S-(-) to the R-(+) enantiomer of about 3. When administered as multiple once-daily 300 mg doses to healthy subjects or to patients with congestive heart failure or ADPKD, tolvaptan\u2019s accumulation factor is <1.2. There is marked inter-subject variation in peak and average exposure to tolvaptan with a percent coefficient of variation ranging between 30 and 60%. Metabolism and Elimination Tolvaptan is metabolized almost exclusively by CYP3A. Fourteen metabolites have been identified in plasma, urine and feces; all but one were also metabolized by CYP3A and none are pharmacodynamically active. After oral administration of radiolabeled tolvaptan, tolvaptan was a minor component in plasma, representing 3% of total plasma radioactivity; the oxobutyric acid metabolite was present at 52.5% of total plasma radioactivity with all other metabolites present at lower concentrations than tolvaptan. The oxobutyric acid metabolite shows a plasma half-life of ~180 h. About 40% of radioactivity was recovered in urine (<1% as unchanged tolvaptan) and 59% in feces (19% as unchanged tolvaptan). Following intravenous infusion, tolvaptan half-life is approximately 3 hours. Following single oral doses to healthy subjects, the estimated half-life of tolvaptan increases from 3 hours for a 15 mg dose to approximately 12 hours for 120 mg and higher doses due to more prolonged absorption of tolvaptan at higher doses; apparent clearance is approximately 4 mL/min/kg and does not appear to change with increasing dose. Specific Populations Hyponatremia In patients with hyponatremia of any origin the clearance of tolvaptan is reduced to about 2 mL/min/kg. Hepatic Impairment Moderate or severe hepatic impairment or congestive heart failure decrease the clearance and increase the volume of distribution of tolvaptan, but the respective changes are not clinically relevant. Exposure and response to tolvaptan in subjects with creatinine clearance ranging between 79 and 10 mL/min and patients with normal renal function are not different. Renal Impairment In a study in patients with creatinine clearances ranging from 10 to 124 mL/min administered a single dose of 60 mg tolvaptan, AUC and C max of plasma tolvaptan were less than doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) relative to the controls. The peak increase in serum sodium was 5 to 6 mEq/L, regardless of renal function, but the onset and offset of tolvaptan's effect on serum sodium were slower in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7 )]. Drug Interaction Studies Impact of Other Drugs on Tolvaptan Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Ketoconazole: Tolvaptan\u2019s C max and AUC were, respectively, 3.5 times and 5.4 times as high following ketoconazole 200 mg given one day prior to and concomitantly with 30 mg tolvaptan [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1 )]. Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors Fluconazole: Fluconazole 400 mg given one day prior and 200 mg given concomitantly produced an 80% and 200% increase in tolvaptan C max and AUC, respectively. Grapefruit Juice: Co-administration of grapefruit juice and tolvaptan results in an increase in C max and AUC of 90% and 60% for tolvaptan, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Rifampin: Rifampin 600 mg once daily for 7 days followed by a single 240 mg dose of tolvaptan decreased both tolvaptan C max and AUC about 85%. Other Drugs Co-administration of lovastatin, digoxin, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide with tolvaptan has no clinically relevant impact on the exposure to tolvaptan. Impact of Tolvaptan on Other Drugs CYP3A Substrates Tolvaptan is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. Co-administration of lovastatin and tolvaptan increases the exposure to lovastatin and its active metabolite lovastatin-\u03b2 hydroxyacid by factors of 1.4 and 1.3, respectively. This is not a clinically relevant change. P-gp Substrates Digoxin: Digoxin 0.25 mg was administered once daily for 12 days. Tolvaptan 60 mg, was co-administered once daily on Days 8 to 12. Digoxin C max and AUC were increased 30% and 20%, respectively. Transporter Substrates Tolvaptan is a substrate of P-gp and an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. The oxobutyric acid metabolite of tolvaptan is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OAT3. Co-administration of tolvaptan with rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) did not have a clinically significant effect on rosuvastatin exposure. Rosuvastatin C max and AUCt increased 54% and 69%, respectively. Administration of rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 substrate) or furosemide (OAT3 substrate) to healthy subjects with elevated oxobutyric acid metabolite plasma concentrations did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin or furosemide. Other Drugs Co-administration of tolvaptan does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, or amiodarone (or its active metabolite, desethylamiodarone) to a clinically significant degree."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolvaptan is a selective vasopressin V 2 -receptor antagonist with an affinity for the V 2 -receptor that is 1.8 times that of native arginine vasopressin (AVP). Tolvaptan affinity for the V 2 -receptor is 29 times greater than for the V 1a -receptor. When taken orally, 15 to 60 mg doses of tolvaptan antagonize the effect of vasopressin and cause an increase in urine water excretion that results in an increase in free water clearance (aquaresis), a decrease in urine osmolality, and a resulting increase in serum sodium concentrations. Urinary excretion of sodium and potassium and plasma potassium concentrations are not significantly changed. Tolvaptan metabolites have no or weak antagonist activity for human V 2 -receptors compared with tolvaptan."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In healthy subjects receiving a single dose of tolvaptan 60 mg, the onset of the aquaretic and sodium increasing effects occurs within 2 to 4 hours post-dose. A peak effect of about a 6 mEq increase in serum sodium and about 9 mL/min increase in urine excretion rate is observed between 4 and 8 hours post-dose; thus, the pharmacological activity lags behind the plasma concentrations of tolvaptan. About 60% of the peak effect on serum sodium is sustained at 24 hours post-dose, but the urinary excretion rate is no longer elevated by this time. Doses above 60 mg tolvaptan do not increase aquaresis or serum sodium further. The effects of tolvaptan in the recommended dose range of 15 to 60 mg once daily appear to be limited to aquaresis and the resulting increase in sodium concentration. Plasma concentrations of native AVP may increase (avg. 2 to 9 pg/mL) with tolvaptan administration. Cardiac Electrophysiology No prolongation of the QT interval was observed with tolvaptan following multiple doses of 300 mg/day for 5 days."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of tolvaptan after single doses of up to 480 mg and multiple doses up to 300 mg once daily have been examined. In hyponatremia subjects, single and multiple doses up to 60 mg have been studied. Absorption In healthy subjects, peak concentrations of tolvaptan are observed between 2 and 4 hours post-dose. Peak concentrations increase less than dose proportionally with doses greater than 240 mg. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan decreases with increasing doses. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan following an oral dose of 30 mg is 56% (range 42 to 80%). Co-administration of 90 mg tolvaptan with a high-fat meal (~1000 calories, of which 50% are from fat) doubles peak concentrations but has no effect on the AUC of tolvaptan; tolvaptan may be administered with or without food. Distribution Tolvaptan binds to both albumin and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein and the overall protein binding is >98%; binding is not affected by disease state. The volume of distribution of tolvaptan is about 3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetic properties of tolvaptan are stereospecific, with a steady-state ratio of the S-(-) to the R-(+) enantiomer of about 3. When administered as multiple once-daily 300 mg doses to healthy subjects or to patients with congestive heart failure or ADPKD, tolvaptan\u2019s accumulation factor is <1.2. There is marked inter-subject variation in peak and average exposure to tolvaptan with a percent coefficient of variation ranging between 30 and 60%. Metabolism and Elimination Tolvaptan is metabolized almost exclusively by CYP3A. Fourteen metabolites have been identified in plasma, urine and feces; all but one were also metabolized by CYP3A and none are pharmacodynamically active. After oral administration of radiolabeled tolvaptan, tolvaptan was a minor component in plasma, representing 3% of total plasma radioactivity; the oxobutyric acid metabolite was present at 52.5% of total plasma radioactivity with all other metabolites present at lower concentrations than tolvaptan. The oxobutyric acid metabolite shows a plasma half-life of ~180 h. About 40% of radioactivity was recovered in urine (<1% as unchanged tolvaptan) and 59% in feces (19% as unchanged tolvaptan). Following intravenous infusion, tolvaptan half-life is approximately 3 hours. Following single oral doses to healthy subjects, the estimated half-life of tolvaptan increases from 3 hours for a 15 mg dose to approximately 12 hours for 120 mg and higher doses due to more prolonged absorption of tolvaptan at higher doses; apparent clearance is approximately 4 mL/min/kg and does not appear to change with increasing dose. Specific Populations Hyponatremia In patients with hyponatremia of any origin the clearance of tolvaptan is reduced to about 2 mL/min/kg. Hepatic Impairment Moderate or severe hepatic impairment or congestive heart failure decrease the clearance and increase the volume of distribution of tolvaptan, but the respective changes are not clinically relevant. Exposure and response to tolvaptan in subjects with creatinine clearance ranging between 79 and 10 mL/min and patients with normal renal function are not different. Renal Impairment In a study in patients with creatinine clearances ranging from 10 to 124 mL/min administered a single dose of 60 mg tolvaptan, AUC and C max of plasma tolvaptan were less than doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) relative to the controls. The peak increase in serum sodium was 5 to 6 mEq/L, regardless of renal function, but the onset and offset of tolvaptan's effect on serum sodium were slower in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7 )]. Drug Interaction Studies Impact of Other Drugs on Tolvaptan Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Ketoconazole: Tolvaptan\u2019s C max and AUC were, respectively, 3.5 times and 5.4 times as high following ketoconazole 200 mg given one day prior to and concomitantly with 30 mg tolvaptan [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1 )]. Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors Fluconazole: Fluconazole 400 mg given one day prior and 200 mg given concomitantly produced an 80% and 200% increase in tolvaptan C max and AUC, respectively. Grapefruit Juice: Co-administration of grapefruit juice and tolvaptan results in an increase in C max and AUC of 90% and 60% for tolvaptan, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Rifampin: Rifampin 600 mg once daily for 7 days followed by a single 240 mg dose of tolvaptan decreased both tolvaptan C max and AUC about 85%. Other Drugs Co-administration of lovastatin, digoxin, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide with tolvaptan has no clinically relevant impact on the exposure to tolvaptan. Impact of Tolvaptan on Other Drugs CYP3A Substrates Tolvaptan is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. Co-administration of lovastatin and tolvaptan increases the exposure to lovastatin and its active metabolite lovastatin-\u03b2 hydroxyacid by factors of 1.4 and 1.3, respectively. This is not a clinically relevant change. P-gp Substrates Digoxin: Digoxin 0.25 mg was administered once daily for 12 days. Tolvaptan 60 mg, was co-administered once daily on Days 8 to 12. Digoxin C max and AUC were increased 30% and 20%, respectively. Transporter Substrates Tolvaptan is a substrate of P-gp and an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. The oxobutyric acid metabolite of tolvaptan is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OAT3. Co-administration of tolvaptan with rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) did not have a clinically significant effect on rosuvastatin exposure. Rosuvastatin C max and AUCt increased 54% and 69%, respectively. Administration of rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 substrate) or furosemide (OAT3 substrate) to healthy subjects with elevated oxobutyric acid metabolite plasma concentrations did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin or furosemide. Other Drugs Co-administration of tolvaptan does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, or amiodarone (or its active metabolite, desethylamiodarone) to a clinically significant degree."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hyponatremia In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies (SALT-1 and SALT-2), a total of 424 patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) resulting from a variety of underlying causes (heart failure, liver cirrhosis, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone [SIADH] and others) were treated for 30 days with tolvaptan or placebo, then followed for an additional 7 days after withdrawal. Symptomatic patients, patients likely to require saline therapy during the course of therapy, patients with acute and transient hyponatremia associated with head trauma or postoperative state and patients with hyponatremia due to primary polydipsia, uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency or uncontrolled hypothyroidism were excluded. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo (N = 220) or tolvaptan (N = 223) at an initial oral dose of 15 mg once daily. The mean serum sodium concentration at study entry was 129 mEq/L. Fluid restriction was to be avoided if possible during the first 24 hours of therapy to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, and during the first 24 hours of therapy 87% of patients had no fluid restriction. Thereafter, patients could resume or initiate fluid restriction (defined as daily fluid intake of \u22641.0 liter/day) as clinically indicated. The dose of tolvaptan could be increased at 24-hour intervals to 30 mg once daily, then to 60 mg once daily, until either the maximum dose of 60 mg or normonatremia (serum sodium >135 mEq/L) was reached. Serum sodium concentrations were determined at 8 hours after study drug initiation and daily up to 72 hours, within which time titration was typically completed. Treatment was maintained for 30 days with additional serum sodium assessments on Days 11, 18, 25 and 30. On the day of study discontinuation, all patients resumed previous therapies for hyponatremia and were reevaluated 7 days later. The primary endpoint for these studies was the average daily AUC for change in serum sodium from baseline to Day 4 and baseline to Day 30 in patients with a serum sodium less than 135 mEq/L. Compared to placebo, tolvaptan caused a statistically greater increase in serum sodium (p <0.0001) during both periods in both studies (see Table 2). For patients with a serum sodium of <130 mEq/L or <125 mEq/L, the effects at Day 4 and Day 30 remained significant (see Table 2). This effect was also seen across all disease etiology subsets (e.g., CHF, cirrhosis, SIADH/other). Table 2.

In patients with hyponatremia (defined as <135 mEq/L), serum sodium concentration increased to a significantly greater degree in tolvaptan-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients as early as 8 hours after the first dose, and the change was maintained for 30 days. The percentage of patients requiring fluid restriction (defined as \u22641 L/day at any time during the treatment period) was also significantly less (p =0.0017) in the tolvaptan-treated group (30/215, 14%) as compared with the placebo-treated group (51/206, 25%). Figure 1 shows the change from baseline in serum sodium by visit in patients with serum sodium <135 mEq/L. Within 7 days of tolvaptan discontinuation, serum sodium concentrations in tolvaptan-treated patients declined to levels similar to those of placebo-treated patients.

By this time, their baseline mean serum sodium concentration had fallen to between their original baseline and post-placebo therapy level. Upon initiation of therapy, average serum sodium concentrations increased to approximately the same levels as observed for those previously treated with tolvaptan and were sustained for at least a year. Figure 3 shows results from 111 patients enrolled in the SALTWATER Study.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypernatremia, dehydration and hypovolemia: May require intervention ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Serious Liver Injury Tolvaptan tablets can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury. Acute liver failure requiring liver transplantation has been reported in the post-marketing ADPKD experience. Discontinuation in response to laboratory abnormalities or signs or symptoms of liver injury (such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, right upper abdominal discomfort, vomiting, fever, rash, pruritus, icterus, dark urine or jaundice) can reduce the risk of severe hepatotoxicity. In a 3-year placebo-controlled trial and its open-label extension (in which patients' liver tests were monitored every 4 months), evidence of serious hepatocellular injury (elevations of hepatic transaminases of at least 3 times ULN combined with elevated bilirubin at least 2 times the ULN) occurred in 0.2% (3/1487) of tolvaptan treated patients compared to none of the placebo treated patients. To reduce the risk of significant or irreversible liver injury, assess ALT, AST and bilirubin prior to initiation of tolvaptan tablets, at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after initiation, then monthly for 18 months and every 3 months thereafter. At the onset of signs or symptoms consistent with hepatic injury or if ALT, AST, or bilirubin increase to >2 times ULN, immediately discontinue tolvaptan tablets, obtain repeat tests as soon as possible (within 48 to 72 hours), and continue testing as appropriate. If laboratory abnormalities stabilize or resolve, tolvaptan tablets may be reinitiated with increased frequency of monitoring as long as ALT and AST remain below 3 times ULN. Do not restart tolvaptan tablets in patients who experience signs or symptoms consistent with hepatic injury or whose ALT or AST ever exceeds 3 times ULN during treatment with tolvaptan, unless there is another explanation for liver injury and the injury has resolved. In patients with a stable, low baseline AST or ALT, an increase above 2 times baseline, even if less than 2 times upper limit of normal, may indicate early liver injury. Such elevations may warrant treatment suspension and prompt (48 to 72 hours) re-evaluation of liver test trends prior to reinitiating therapy with more frequent monitoring. 5.2 Tolvaptan for ADPKD Shared System REMS Tolvaptan tablets are available only through a restricted distribution program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Tolvaptan for ADPKD Shared System REMS, because of the risks of liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Notable requirements of the Tolvaptan for ADPKD Shared System REMS include the following: Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the REMS program. Prescribers must inform patients receiving tolvaptan tablets about the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with its use and how to recognize the signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity and the appropriate actions to take if it occurs. Patients must enroll in the REMS program and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Pharmacies must be certified by enrolling in the REMS program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive tolvaptan tablets. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TolvaptanADPKDSharedREMS.com or by telephone at 1-866-244-9446. 5.3 Hypernatremia, Dehydration and Hypovolemia Tolvaptan tablets increase free water clearance and, as a result, may cause dehydration, hypovolemia and hypernatremia. Therefore, ensure abnormalities in sodium concentrations are corrected prior to initiation of therapy. Instruct patients to drink water when thirsty, and throughout the day and night if awake. Monitor for weight loss, tachycardia and hypotension because they may signal dehydration. In the two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with ADPKD, hypernatremia (defined as any serum sodium concentration >150 mEq/L) was observed in 4% versus 0.6% and 1.4% versus 0% of tolvaptan- treated versus placebo-treated patients, respectively. The rate of dehydration and hypovolemia in the two studies was 2.1% versus 0.7% and 2.3% versus 0.4% for tolvaptan-treated versus placebo-treated patients, respectively. During tolvaptan tablets therapy, if serum sodium increases above normal range or the patient becomes hypovolemic or dehydrated and fluid intake cannot be increased, then suspend tolvaptan tablets until serum sodium, hydration status and volume status is within the normal range. 5.4 Co-Administration with Inhibitors of CYP 3A Concomitant use of tolvaptan tablets with drugs that are moderate or strong CYP 3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, and conivaptan) increases tolvaptan exposure [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Use with strong CYP 3A inhibitors is contraindicated; dose reduction of tolvaptan tablets are recommended for patients while taking moderate CYP 3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Contraindications ( 4 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Serious Liver Injury [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Hypernatremia, Dehydration and Hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Drug Interactions with Inhibitors of CYP 3A [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Most common observed adverse reactions with tolvaptan tablets (incidence >10% and at least twice that for placebo) were thirst, polyuria, nocturia, pollakiuria and polydipsia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tolvaptan tablets have been studied in over 3000 patients with ADPKD. Long-term, placebo-controlled safety information of tolvaptan tablets in ADPKD is principally derived from two trials where 1,413 subjects received tolvaptan and 1,098 received placebo for at least 12 months across both studies. TEMPO 3:4 -NCT00428948: A Phase 3, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Trial in Early, Rapidly-Progressing ADPKD The TEMPO 3:4 trial employed a two-arm, 2:1 randomization to tolvaptan or placebo, titrated to a maximally-tolerated total daily dose of 60 to 120 mg. A total of 961 subjects with rapidly progressing ADPKD were randomized to tolvaptan tablets. Of these, 742 (77%) subjects who were treated with tolvaptan tablets remained on treatment for at least 3 years. The average daily dose in these subjects was 96 mg daily. Adverse events that led to discontinuation were reported for 15.4% (148/961) of subjects in the tolvaptan tablets group and 5% (24/483) of subjects in the placebo group. Aquaretic effects were the most common reasons for discontinuation of tolvaptan tablets. These included pollakiuria, polyuria, or nocturia in 63 (6.6%) subjects treated with tolvaptan tablets compared to 1 subject (0.2%) treated with placebo. Table 2 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 3% of ADPKD subjects treated with tolvaptan tablets and at least 1.5% more than on placebo. Table 2: TEMPO 3:4, Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions in \u22653% of Tolvaptan Tablets Treated Subjects with Risk Difference \u2265 1.5%, Randomized Period Adverse Reaction Tolvaptan (N=961) Placebo (N=483) Number of Subjects Proportion (%) 100x (Number of subjects with an adverse event/N) Annualized Rate 100x (Number of subjects with an adverse event/Total subject years of drug exposure) Number of Subjects Proportion (%) Annualized Rate Increased urination Increased urination includes micturition urgency, nocturia, pollakiuria, polyuria 668 69.5 28.6 135 28 10.3 Thirst Thirst includes polydipsia and thirst 612 63.7 26.2 113 23.4 8.7 Dry mouth 154 16 6.6 60 12.4 4.6 Fatigue 131 13.6 5.6 47 9.7 3.6 Diarrhea 128 13.3 5.5 53 11 4.1 Dizziness 109 11.3 4.7 42 8.7 3.2 Dyspepsia 76 7.9 3.3 16 3.3 1.2 Decreased appetite 69 7.2 3 5 1 0.4 Abdominal distension 47 4.9 2 16 3.3 1.2 Dry skin 47 4.9 2 8 1.7 0.6 Rash 40 4.2 1.7 9 1.9 0.7 Hyperuricemia 37 3.9 1.6 9 1.9 0.7 Palpitations 34 3.5 1.5 6 1.2 0.5 REPRISE-NCT02160145: A Phase 3, Randomized-Withdrawal, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Trial in Late Stage 2 to Early Stage 4 ADPKD The REPRISE trial employed a 5-week single-blind titration and run-in period for tolvaptan tablets prior to the randomized double-blind period. During the tolvaptan tablets titration and run-in period, 126 (8.4%) of the 1496 subjects discontinued the study, 52 (3.5%) were due to aquaretic effects and 10 (0.7%) were due to liver test findings. Because of this run-in design, the adverse reaction rates observed during the randomized period are not described. Liver Injury: In the two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, ALT elevations >3 times ULN were observed at an increased frequency with tolvaptan tablets compared with placebo (4.9% [80/1637] versus 1.1% [13/1166], respectively) within the first 18 months after initiating treatment and increases usually resolved within 1 to 4 months after discontinuing the drug. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tolvaptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data with tolvaptan tablets use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. In embryo-fetal development studies, pregnant rats and rabbits received oral tolvaptan during organogenesis. At maternally non-toxic doses, tolvaptan did not cause any developmental toxicity in rats or in rabbits at exposures approximately 4- and 1-times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 90/30 mg. However, effects on embryo-fetal development occurred in both species at maternally toxic doses. In rats, reduced fetal weights and delayed fetal ossification occurred at 17-times the human exposure. In rabbits, increased abortions, embryo-fetal death, fetal microphthalmia, open eyelids, cleft palate, brachymelia and skeletal malformations occurred at approximately 3-times the human exposure (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data: Oral administration of tolvaptan during the period of organogenesis in Sprague-Dawley rats produced no evidence of teratogenesis at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. Lower body weights and delayed ossification were seen at 1000 mg/kg, which is approximately 17-times the exposure in humans at the 90/30 mg dose (AUC 24h 6570 h\u00b7ng/mL). The fetal effects are likely secondary to maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and low body weights). In a prenatal and postnatal study in rats, tolvaptan had no effect on physical development, reflex function, learning ability or reproductive performance at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day. In New Zealand White rabbits, placental transfer was demonstrated with C max values in the yolk sac fluid approximating 22.7% of the value in maternal rabbit serum. In embryo-fetal studies, teratogenicity (microphthalmia, embryo-fetal mortality, cleft palate, brachymelia and fused phalanx) was evident in rabbits at 1000 mg/kg (approximately 3 times the exposure at the 90/30 mg dose). Body weights and food consumption were lower in dams at all doses, equivalent to 0.6 to 3-times the human exposure at the 90/30 mg dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tolvaptan in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Tolvaptan is present in rat milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is possible that the drug will be present in human milk, but relative levels may vary (see Data) . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including liver toxicity, electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypernatremia), hypotension, and volume depletion in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with tolvaptan tablets. Data In lactating rats administration of radiolabeled tolvaptan, lacteal radioactivity concentrations reached the highest level at 8 hours after administration and then decreased gradually with time with a half-life of 27.3 hours. The level of activity in milk ranged from 1.5- to 15.8-fold those in blood over the period of 72 hours post-dose. In a prenatal and postnatal study in rats, maternal toxicity was noted at 100 mg/kg/day or higher (\u22654.4 times the human exposure at the 90/30 mg dose). Increased perinatal death and decreased body weight of the offspring were observed during the lactation period and after weaning at approximately 17.3 times the human exposure at the 90/30 mg dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of tolvaptan tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tolvaptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years old and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Because of the risk of serious liver injury, use is contraindicated in patients with a history, signs or symptoms of significant liver impairment or injury. This contraindication does not apply to uncomplicated polycystic liver disease which was present in 60% and 66% of patients in TEMPO 3:4 and REPRISE, respectively. No specific exclusion for hepatic impairment was implemented in TEMPO 3:4. However, REPRISE excluded patients with ADPKD who had hepatic impairment or liver function abnormalities other than that expected for ADPKD with typical cystic liver disease [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment Efficacy studies included patients with normal and reduced renal function [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] . TEMPO 3:4 required patients to have an estimated creatinine clearance \u2265 60 mL/min, while REPRISE included patients with eGFR CKD-Epi 25 to 65 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ."

There is no specific antidote for tolvaptan intoxication. The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose can be anticipated to be those of excessive pharmacologic effect: a rise in serum sodium concentration, polyuria, thirst, and dehydration/hypovolemia. No mortality was observed in rats or dogs following single oral doses of 2000 mg/kg (maximum feasible dose). A single oral dose of 2000 mg/kg was lethal in mice, and symptoms of toxicity in affected mice included decreased locomotor activity, staggering gait, tremor and hypothermia. In patients with suspected tolvaptan tablets overdosage, assessment of vital signs, electrolyte concentrations, ECG and fluid status is recommended. Continue replacement of water and electrolytes until aquaresis abates.

Decreased binding of vasopressin to the V 2 -receptor in the kidney lowers adenylate cyclase activity resulting in a decrease in intracellular adenosine 3\u2032, 5\u2032-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations. Decreased cAMP concentrations prevent aquaporin 2 containing vesicles from fusing with the plasma membrane, which in turn causes an increase in urine water excretion, an increase in free water clearance (aquaresis) and a decrease in urine osmolality. In human ADPKD cyst epithelial cells, tolvaptan inhibited AVP- stimulated in vitro cyst growth and chloride-dependent fluid secretion into cysts. In animal models, decreased cAMP concentrations were associated with decreases in the rate of growth of total kidney volume and the rate of formation and enlargement of kidney cysts. Tolvaptan metabolites have no or weak antagonist activity for human V 2 -receptors compared with tolvaptan. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In healthy subjects or patients with eGFRs as low as 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 receiving a single dose of tolvaptan, the onset of the aquaretic effects occurs within 1 to 2 hours post-dose. In healthy subjects, single doses of 60 mg and 90 mg produce a peak effect of about a 9 mL/min increase in urine excretion rate is observed between 4 and 8 hours post-dose. Higher doses of tolvaptan do not increase the peak effect in urine excretion rate but sustain the effect for a longer period of time. Urine excretion rate returns to baseline within 24 hours following the maximum recommended 90 mg dose of tolvaptan. Changes in free water clearance mirror the changes in urine excretion rate. Increased free water clearance causes an increase in serum sodium concentration unless fluid intake is increased to match urine output. Increases in urine excretion rate and free water clearance are positively correlated with baseline glomerular filtration rate with increases in both values observed in patients with creatinine clearance as low as 15 mL/min. With the recommended split-dose regimens, tolvaptan inhibits vasopressin from binding to the V 2 -receptor in the kidney for the entire day, as indicated by increased urine output and decreased urine osmolality. Following a 90/30 mg split-dose regimen in patients with eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , the change in mean daily urine volume was about 4 L for a mean total daily volume of about 7 L. In patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , the mean change in daily urine volume was about 2 L for a total daily urine volume of about 5 L. Plasma concentrations of native AVP may increase (avg. 2 to 9 pg/mL) with tolvaptan treatment and return to baseline levels when treatment is stopped. During tolvaptan treatment, small changes in renal function are expected and the changes are independent of baseline renal function. Glomerular filtration rate is decreased about 6% to 10% and uric acid clearance is decreased about 20% to 25%. Percent changes in renal plasma flow are highly correlated to percent changes in GFR. These changes are reversed upon discontinuation of tolvaptan. Cardiac Electrophysiology No prolongation of the QT interval was observed with tolvaptan following multiple doses of 300 mg/day for 5 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of tolvaptan after single doses of up to 480 mg and multiple doses up to 300 mg once daily have been studied. In ADPKD patients, single doses up to 120 mg and multiple split-doses up to 90/30 mg have been studied. Absorption In healthy subjects, peak concentrations of tolvaptan are observed between 2 and 4 hours post-dose. Peak concentrations increase less than dose proportionally with doses greater than 240 mg. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan decreases with increasing doses. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan following an oral dose of 30 mg is 56% (range 42 to 80%). Co-administration of 90 mg tolvaptan tablets with a high-fat meal (~1000 calories, of which 50% are from fat) doubles peak concentrations but has no effect on the AUC of tolvaptan; tolvaptan may be administered with or without food. Distribution Tolvaptan binds to both albumin and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein and the overall protein binding is >98%; binding is not affected by disease state. The volume of distribution of tolvaptan is about 3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetic properties of tolvaptan are stereospecific, with a steady-state ratio of the S-(-) to the R-(+) enantiomer of about 3. When administered as multiple once-daily 300 mg doses to healthy subjects or as split-dose regimens to patients with ADPKD, tolvaptan's accumulation factor is <1.2. There is marked inter-subject variation in peak and average exposure to tolvaptan with a percent coefficient of variation ranging between 30 and 60%. Metabolism and Elimination Tolvaptan is metabolized almost exclusively by CYP 3A. Fourteen metabolites have been identified in plasma, urine and feces; all but one were also metabolized by CYP 3A and none are pharmacodynamically active. After oral administration of radiolabeled tolvaptan, tolvaptan was a minor component in plasma representing 3% of total plasma radioactivity; the oxobutyric acid metabolite was present at 52.5% of total plasma radioactivity with all other metabolites present at lower concentrations than tolvaptan. The oxobutyric acid metabolite shows a plasma half-life of ~180 h. About 40% of radioactivity was recovered in urine (<1% as unchanged tolvaptan) and 59% in feces (19% as unchanged tolvaptan). Following intravenous infusion, tolvaptan half-life is approximately 3 hours. Following single oral doses to healthy subjects, the estimated half-life of tolvaptan increases from 3 hours for a 15 mg dose to approximately 12 hours for 120 mg and higher doses due to more prolonged absorption of tolvaptan at higher doses; apparent clearance is approximately 4 mL/min/kg and does not appear to change with increasing dose. Specific Populations: Age, Gender and Race Age, gender and race have no effect on tolvaptan pharmacokinetics. Hepatic Impairment In studies involving patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A-C), but without ADPKD; moderate (class A, B) or severe (class C) hepatic impairment decreases the clearance and increases the volume of distribution of tolvaptan. Renal Impairment In subjects with creatinine clearances ranging from 10 to 124 mL/min administered a single dose of 60 mg tolvaptan, the AUC and C max of plasma tolvaptan was increased 90% and 10%, respectively, for subjects with clearances of <30 mL/min compared to subjects with clearances >60 mL/min [see Use in Special Populations ( 8.7 ) ]. In ADPKD patients with estimated creatinine clearance >60 mL/min, pharmacokinetics were similar to healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Impact of Other Drugs on Tolvaptan: Strong CYP 3A Inhibitors Tolvaptan's C max and AUC were, respectively, 3.5 times and 5.4 times as high following ketoconazole 200 mg given one day prior to and concomitantly with 30 mg tolvaptan. Moderate CYP 3A4 Inhibitors Fluconazole: Fluconazole 400 mg given one day prior and 200 mg given concomitantly produced an 80% and 200% increase in tolvaptan C max and AUC, respectively. Grapefruit Juice: When 60 mg tolvaptan was taken with 240 mL regular strength grapefruit juice, tolvaptan C max and AUC increased 90% and 60%, respectively. CYP 3A Inducers Rifampin: Rifampin 600 mg once daily for 7 days followed by a single 240 mg dose of tolvaptan decreased both tolvaptan C max and AUC about 85%. Other Drugs Co-administration of lovastatin, digoxin, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide with tolvaptan has no clinically relevant impact on the exposure to tolvaptan. Impact of Tolvaptan on Other Drugs: CYP 3A Substrates Co-administration of lovastatin and tolvaptan increases the AUC of lovastatin and its active metabolite lovastatin-\u03b2 hydroxy acid by 40% and 30%, respectively. These are non-clinically significant increases in exposure. P-gp Substrates Digoxin: Digoxin 0.25 mg was administered once daily for 12 days. Tolvaptan 60 mg, was co-administered once daily on Days 8 to 12. Digoxin C max and AUC were increased 30% and 20%, respectively. Transporter Substrates Tolvaptan is a substrate of P-gp and an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. The oxobutyric acid metabolite of tolvaptan is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OAT3. Co-administration of tolvaptan with rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) did not have a clinically significant effect on rosuvastatin exposure. Rosuvastatin C max and AUC t increased 54% and 69%, respectively. Administration of rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 substrate) or furosemide (OAT3 substrate) to healthy subjects with elevated oxobutyric acid metabolite plasma concentrations did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin or furosemide. Other Drugs Co-administration of tolvaptan did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, or amiodarone (or its active metabolite, desethylamiodarone)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tolvaptan tablets were shown to slow the rate of decline in renal function in patients at risk of rapidly progressing ADPKD in two trials; TEMPO 3:4 in patients at earlier stages of disease and REPRISE in patients at later stages. The findings from these trials, when taken together, suggest that tolvaptan tablets slows the loss of renal function progressively through the course of the disease. TEMPO 3:4-NCT00428948: A Phase 3, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Trial in Early, Rapidly-Progressing ADPKD In TEMPO 3:4, 1445 adult patients (age >18 years) with early (estimated creatinine clearance [eCrCl] \u226560 mL/min), rapidly-progressing (total kidney volume [TKV] \u2265750 mL and age <51 years) ADPKD (diagnosed by modified Ravine criteria) were randomized 2:1 to treatment with tolvaptan or placebo. Patients were treated for up to 3 years; patients who discontinued medication prematurely were only required to attend clinic visits to assess renal function for up to 42 days after treatment withdrawal and to attend telephone visits at all scheduled visits for up to 36 months. Patients who completed treatment at the 3-year visit had treatment interrupted for 2 to 6 weeks to assess renal function post treatment. Patients received treatment twice a day (first dose on waking, second dose approximately 9 hours later). Patients were initiated on 45 mg/15 mg, and up-titrated weekly to 60 mg/30 mg and then to 90 mg/30 mg as tolerated. Patients were to maintain the highest tolerated dose for 3 years, but could interrupt, decrease and/or increase as clinical circumstances warranted within the range of titrated doses. All patients were encouraged to drink adequate water to avoid thirst or dehydration and before bedtime. The primary endpoint was the intergroup difference for rate of change of TKV normalized as a percentage. The key secondary composite endpoint (ADPKD progression) was time to multiple clinical progression events of: 1) worsening kidney function (defined as a persistent 25% reduction in reciprocal serum creatinine during treatment from end of titration to last on-drug visit); 2) medically significant kidney pain (defined as requiring prescribed leave, last-resort analgesics, narcotic and anti-nociceptive, radiologic or surgical interventions); 3) worsening hypertension (defined as a persistent increase in blood pressure category or an increased anti-hypertensive prescription); 4) worsening albuminuria (defined as a persistent increase in albumin/creatinine ratio category). At baseline, average estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 82 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (CKD- Epidemiology formula) and mean TKV was 1692 mL (height adjusted 972 mL/m). Approximately 35% had an eGFR of 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or greater, 48% had an eGFR between 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , 14% had an eGFR of 45 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and 3% had an eGFR of <45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . The subjects' mean age was 39 years, 48% were female, 84% were Caucasian, 13% were Asian, and 1.7% were Black or African-American. Approximately 80% had hypertension and approximately 71% were taking an agent that acts on the renin-angiotensin system. Of the 770 subjects who submitted to genetic analysis in TEMPO 3:4's open-label extension, 749 (97%) had an identifiable mutation in the PKD1 (656 or 88%), or PKD2 (93 or 12%) gene. The trial met its prespecified primary endpoint of 3-year change in TKV (p<0.0001). The difference in TKV between treatment groups mostly developed within the first year, the earliest assessment, with little further difference in years two and three. In years 4 and 5 during the TEMPO 3:4 extension trial, both groups received tolvaptan tablets and the difference between the groups in TKV was not maintained. Tolvaptan has little effect on kidney size beyond what accrues during the first year of treatment. The relative rate of ADPKD-related events was decreased by 13.5% in tolvaptan-treated patients, (44 vs. 50 events per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.97; p=0.0095). As shown in the table below, the result of the key secondary composite endpoint was driven by effects on worsening kidney function and kidney pain events. In contrast, there was no effect of tolvaptan on either progression of hypertension or albuminuria. Few subjects in either arm required a radiologic or surgical intervention for kidney pain. Most kidney pain events reflected use of a medication to treat pain such as use of paracetamol, tricyclic antidepressants, narcotics and other non-narcotic agents.

The estimated difference in the annual rate of change in those who contributed to the analysis was 1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year with a 95% confidence interval of (0.6, 1.4). Of the subjects enrolled in the trial, 5% of subjects in the tolvaptan arm and 2% in the placebo arm either had missing baseline data or discontinued from treatment prior to the end of the titration visit and hence were excluded from the analysis. In the extension trial, eGFR differences produced by the third year of the TEMPO 3:4 trial were maintained over the next 2 years of tolvaptan tablets treatment. The efficacy profile was generally consistent across subgroups of interest for this indication; few Black or African-American patients were enrolled in the trial. REPRISE-NCT02160145: A Phase 3, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Withdrawal Trial in Later-Stage ADPKD REPRISE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal trial in adult patients (age 18 to 65 years) with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an eGFR between 25 and 65 mL/min/1.73 m 2 if younger than age 56 years; or eGFR between 25 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , plus eGFR decline >2 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year if between age 56 to 65 years. Subjects were to be treated for 12 months; after completion of treatment, patients entered a 3-week follow-up period to assess renal function. The primary endpoint was the treatment difference in the change of eGFR from pre-treatment baseline to post-treatment follow-up, annualized by dividing by each subject's treatment duration. Prior to randomization, patients were required to complete sequential single-blind run-in periods during which they received placebo for 1 week, followed by tolvaptan titration for 2 weeks, and then treatment with tolvaptan at the highest tolerated dose achieved during titration for 3 weeks. During the titration period, tolvaptan was up- titrated every 3 to 4 days from a daily oral dose of 30 mg/15 mg to 45 mg/15 mg, 60 mg/30 mg and up to a maximum dose of 90 mg/30 mg. Only patients who could tolerate the two highest doses of tolvaptan (60 mg/30 mg or 90 mg/30 mg) for the subsequent 3 weeks were randomized 1:1 to treatment with tolvaptan or placebo. Patients were maintained on their highest tolerated dose for a period of 12 months but could interrupt, decrease and/or increase as clinical circumstances warranted within the range of titrated doses. All patients were encouraged to start drinking an adequate amount of water at screening and continuing through the end of the trial to avoid thirst or dehydration. A total of 1519 subjects were enrolled in the study. Of these, 1370 subjects successfully completed the pre- randomization period and were randomized and treated during the 12-month double-blind period. Because 57 subjects did not complete the off-treatment follow-up period, 1313 subjects were included in the primary efficacy analysis. For subjects randomized, the baseline, average estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 41 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (CKD-Epidemiology formula) and historical TKV, available in 318 (23%) of subjects, averaged 2026 mL. Approximately 5%, 75% and 20% had an eGFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or greater, between 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and between 25 and 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , respectively. The subjects' mean age was 47 years, 50% were female, 92% were Caucasian, 4% Black or African-American and 3% were Asian, 93% had hypertension, and 87% of subjects were taking antihypertensive agents affecting the angiotensin converting enzyme or receptor. Of the 115 (8%) of subjects who had prior genetic tests, only 54 (47%) knew their results with 48 (89%) of these having PKD1 and 6 (11%) having PKD2 mutations. In the randomized period, the change of eGFR from pretreatment baseline to post-treatment follow-up was -2.3 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year with tolvaptan as compared with -3.6 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year with placebo, corresponding to a treatment effect of 1.3 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year (p <0.0001). The key secondary endpoint (eGFR slope in mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year assessed using a linear mixed effect model of annualized eGFR (CKD- EPI)) showed a difference between treatment groups of 1 mL/min/m 2 /year that was also statistically significant (p < 0.0001). The efficacy profile was generally consistent across subgroups of interest for this indication; few Black or African-American patients were enrolled in the trial."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tolvaptan tablets should be initiated and re-initiated in a hospital ( 2.1 ) The recommended starting dose is 15 mg once daily. Dosage may be increased at intervals \u226524 hr to 30 mg once daily, and to a maximum of 60 mg once daily as needed to raise serum sodium. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Patients should be in a hospital for initiation and re-initiation of therapy to evaluate the therapeutic response and because too rapid correction of hyponatremia can cause osmotic demyelination resulting in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma and death. The usual starting dose for tolvaptan is 15 mg administered once daily without regard to meals. Increase the dose to 30 mg once daily, after at least 24 hours, to a maximum of 60 mg once daily, as needed to achieve the desired level of serum sodium. Do not administer tolvaptan for more than 30 days to minimize the risk of liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . During initiation and titration, frequently monitor for changes in serum electrolytes and volume. Avoid fluid restriction during the first 24 hours of therapy. Patients receiving tolvaptan should be advised that they can continue ingestion of fluid in response to thirst [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 2.2 Drug Withdrawal Following discontinuation from tolvaptan, patients should be advised to resume fluid restriction and should be monitored for changes in serum sodium and volume status."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Liver injury: Limit treatment duration to 30 days. If hepatic injury is suspected, discontinue tolvaptan tablets. Avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease ( 5.2 ) Dehydration and hypovolemia may require intervention ( 5.3 ) Avoid use with hypertonic saline ( 5.4 ) Avoid use with moderate to strong CYP 3A inhibitors ( 5.5 ) Monitor serum potassium in patients with potassium >5 mEq/L or on drugs known to increase potassium ( 5.6 ) Urinary outflow obstruction: Urinary output must be secured ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Too Rapid Correction of Serum Sodium Can Cause Serious Neurologic Sequelae Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a risk associated with too rapid correction of hyponatremia (e.g., >12 mEq/L/24 hours). Osmotic demyelination results in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma or death. In susceptible patients, including those with severe malnutrition, alcoholism or advanced liver disease, slower rates of correction may be advisable. In controlled clinical trials in which tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses starting at 15 mg once daily, 7% of tolvaptan-treated subjects with a serum sodium <130 mEq/L had an increase in serum sodium greater than 8 mEq/L at approximately 8 hours and 2% had an increase greater than 12 mEq/L at 24 hours. Approximately 1% of placebo-treated subjects with a serum sodium <130 mEq/L had a rise greater than 8 mEq/L at 8 hours and no patient had a rise greater than 12 mEq/L/24 hours. Osmotic demyelination syndrome has been reported in association with tolvaptan therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Patients treated with tolvaptan should be monitored to assess serum sodium concentrations and neurologic status, especially during initiation and after titration. Subjects with SIADH or very low baseline serum sodium concentrations may be at greater risk for too-rapid correction of serum sodium. In patients receiving tolvaptan who develop too rapid a rise in serum sodium, discontinue or interrupt treatment with tolvaptan and consider administration of hypotonic fluid. Fluid restriction during the first 24 hours of therapy with tolvaptan tablets may increase the likelihood of overly-rapid correction of serum sodium and should generally be avoided. Co-administration of diuretics also increases the risk of too rapid correction of serum sodium and such patients should undergo close monitoring of serum sodium. 5.2 Liver Injury Tolvaptan can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury. In placebo-controlled studies and an open-label extension study of chronically administered tolvaptan in patients with ADPKD, cases of serious liver injury attributed to tolvaptan, generally occurring during the first 18 months of therapy, were observed. In postmarketing experience with tolvaptan in ADPKD, acute injury resulting in liver failure requiring liver transplantation has been reported. Tolvaptan should not be used to treat ADPKD outside of the FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for ADPKD patients [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Patients with symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice should discontinue treatment with tolvaptan. Limit duration of therapy with tolvaptan to 30 days. Avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease, including cirrhosis, because the ability to recover from liver injury may be impaired [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.3 Dehydration and Hypovolemia Tolvaptan therapy induces copious aquaresis, which is normally partially offset by fluid intake. Dehydration and hypovolemia can occur, especially in potentially volume-depleted patients receiving diuretics or those who are fluid restricted. In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials in which 607 hyponatremic patients were treated with tolvaptan, the incidence of dehydration was 3.3% for tolvaptan and 1.5% for placebo-treated patients. In patients receiving tolvaptan who develop medically significant signs or symptoms of hypovolemia, interrupt or discontinue tolvaptan therapy and provide supportive care with careful management of vital signs, fluid balance and electrolytes. Fluid restriction during therapy with tolvaptan may increase the risk of dehydration and hypovolemia. Patients receiving tolvaptan should continue ingestion of fluid in response to thirst. 5.4 Co-administration with Hypertonic Saline Concomitant use with hypertonic saline is not recommended. 5.5 Drug Interactions Tolvaptan is a substrate of CYP3A. Moderate to strong CYP3A inhibitors can lead to a marked increase in tolvaptan concentrations [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Do not use tolvaptan tablets with strong inhibitors of CYP3A [see Contraindications ( 4 )] and avoid concomitant use with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. 5.6 Hyperkalemia or Drugs that Increase Serum Potassium Treatment with tolvaptan is associated with an acute reduction of the extracellular fluid volume which could result in increased serum potassium. Serum potassium levels should be monitored after initiation of tolvaptan treatment in patients with a serum potassium >5 mEq/L as well as those who are receiving drugs known to increase serum potassium levels. 5.7 Acute Urinary Retention with Outflow Obstruction Patients with partial obstruction of urinary outflow, for example, patients with prostatic hypertrophy or impairment of micturition, have an increased risk of developing acute retention. Do not administer tolvaptan in patients with uncorrected urinary outflow obstruction."

Do not use tolvaptan tablets with strong inhibitors of CYP3A [see Contraindications ( 4 )] and avoid concomitant use with moderate CYP3A inhibitors.",
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concomitant use with: Moderate CYP3A inhibitors (7.1) Strong CYP3A inducers (7.1) V2-receptor antagonists (7.3) Monitor serum potassium during concomitant therapy with ( 7.2 ) Angiotensin receptor blockers Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors Potassium sparing diuretics 7.1 CYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Tolvaptan AUC was 5.4 times as large and C max was 3.5 times as large after co-administration of tolvaptan and 200 mg ketoconazole [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Larger doses of the strong CYP3A inhibitor would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. Concomitant use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors A substantial increase in the exposure to tolvaptan would be expected when tolvaptan tablets are co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid co-administration of tolvaptan tablets with moderate CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Patients should avoid grapefruit juice beverages while taking tolvaptan tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Strong CYP3A Inducers Co-administration of tolvaptan tablets with strong CYP3A inducers reduces exposure to tolvaptan tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Avoid concomitant use of tolvaptan tablets with strong CYP3A inducers. 7.2 Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Potassium Sparing Diuretics Although specific interaction studies were not performed, in clinical studies tolvaptan was used concomitantly with beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and potassium sparing diuretics. Adverse reactions of hyperkalemia were approximately 1 to 2% higher when tolvaptan was administered with angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and potassium sparing diuretics compared to administration of these medications with placebo. Serum potassium levels should be monitored during concomitant drug therapy. 7.3 V 2 -Receptor Agonist As a V 2 -receptor antagonist, tolvaptan may interfere with the V 2 -agonist activity of desmopressin (dDAVP). Avoid concomitant use of tolvaptan tablets with a V 2 -agonist."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22655% placebo) are thirst, dry mouth, asthenia, constipation, pollakiuria or polyuria, and hyperglycemia ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 ( www.fda.gov/medwatch ). 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse event information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials, 607 hyponatremic patients (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) were treated with tolvaptan. The mean age of these patients was 62 years; 70% of patients were male and 82% were Caucasian. One hundred eighty-nine (189) tolvaptan-treated patients had a serum sodium <130 mEq/L, and 52 patients had a serum sodium <125 mEq/L. Hyponatremia was attributed to cirrhosis in 17% of patients, heart failure in 68% and SIADH/other in 16%. Of these patients, 223 were treated with the recommended dose titration (15 mg titrated to 60 mg as needed to raise serum sodium). Overall, over 4,000 patients have been treated with oral doses of tolvaptan in open-label or placebo-controlled clinical trials. Approximately 650 of these patients had hyponatremia; approximately 219 of these hyponatremic patients were treated with tolvaptan for 6 months or more. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655% more than placebo) seen in two 30\u2011day, double-blind, placebo-controlled hyponatremia trials in which tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses (15 mg to 60 mg once daily) were thirst, dry mouth, asthenia, constipation, pollakiuria or polyuria and hyperglycemia. In these trials, 10% (23/223) of tolvaptan-treated patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event, compared to 12% (26/220) of placebo-treated patients; no adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of trial medication occurred at an incidence of >1% in tolvaptan-treated patients. 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in tolvaptan-treated patients with hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) and at a rate at least 2% greater than placebo-treated patients in two 30\u2011day, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In these studies, 223 patients were exposed to tolvaptan (starting dose 15 mg, titrated to 30 and 60 mg as needed to raise serum sodium). Adverse events resulting in death in these trials were 6% in tolvaptan-treated-patients and 6% in placebo-treated patients. Table 1.

Gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis In patients with cirrhosis treated with tolvaptan in the hyponatremia trials, gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 6 out of 63 (10%) tolvaptan-treated patients and 1 out of 57 (2%) placebo treated patients. The following adverse reactions occurred in <2% of hyponatremic patients treated with tolvaptan and at a rate greater than placebo in double-blind placebo-controlled trials (N = 607 tolvaptan; N = 518 placebo) or in <2% of patients in an uncontrolled trial of patients with hyponatremia (N = 111) and are not mentioned elsewhere in the label.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Neurologic: Osmotic demyelination syndrome Investigations: Hypernatremia Removal of excess free body water increases serum osmolality and serum sodium concentrations. All patients treated with tolvaptan, especially those whose serum sodium levels become normal, should continue to be monitored to ensure serum sodium remains within normal limits. If hypernatremia is observed, management may include dose decreases or interruption of tolvaptan treatment, combined with modification of free-water intake or infusion. During clinical trials of hyponatremic patients, hypernatremia was reported as an adverse event in 0.7% of patients receiving tolvaptan vs. 0.6% of patients receiving placebo; analysis of laboratory values demonstrated an incidence of hypernatremia of 1.7% in patients receiving tolvaptan vs. 0.8% in patients receiving placebo.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: There are no studies ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data with tolvaptan tablet use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Tolvaptan did not cause any developmental toxicity in rats or in rabbits at exposures approximately 2.8 and 0.8 times, respectively, the exposure in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 60 mg once daily. However, effects on embryo-fetal development occurred in both species at doses causing significant maternally toxic doses. In rats, reduced fetal weights and delayed fetal ossification occurred at 11 times the exposure in CHF patients, based on AUC. In rabbits, increased abortions, embryo-fetal death, fetal microphthalmia, open eyelids, cleft palate, brachymelia and skeletal malformations occurred at approximately 1.6 times the exposure in CHF patients ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tolvaptan during the period of organogenesis in Sprague-Dawley rats produced no evidence of teratogenesis at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. Delayed ossification was seen at 1000 mg/kg, which is approximately 11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg (AUC 24h 10271 ng*h/mL). The fetal effects are likely secondary to maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and low body weights). In a prenatal and postnatal study in rats, tolvaptan had no effect on physical development, reflex function, learning ability or reproductive performance at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg). In rabbits, teratogenicity (microphthalmia, embryo-fetal mortality, cleft palate, brachymelia and skeletal malformations) was observed in rabbits at 1,000 mg/kg (approximately 1.6 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg dose). This dose also caused maternal toxicity (lower body weight gains and food consumption). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tolvaptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Tolvaptan is present in rat milk (see Data). When a drug is present in animal milk, it is possible that the drug will be present in human milk, but relative levels may vary ( see Data ). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypernatremia), hypotension, and volume depletion in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with tolvaptan tablets. Data In lactating rats administered radiolabeled tolvaptan, lacteal radioactivity concentrations reached the highest level at 8 hours after administration and then decreased gradually with time with a half-life of 27.3 hours. The level of activity in milk ranged from 1.5- to 15.8-fold those in maternal blood over a period of 72 hours post-dose. Increased perinatal death and decreased body weight of the offspring were observed during the lactation period and after weaning at approximately 11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of tolvaptan in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of hyponatremic subjects treated with tolvaptan in clinical studies, 42% were 65 years old and over, while 19% were 75 years old and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Increasing age has no effect on tolvaptan plasma concentrations. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Moderate and severe hepatic impairment do not affect exposure to tolvaptan to a clinically relevant extent. Avoid use of tolvaptan in patients with underlying liver disease. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary based on renal function. There are no clinical trial data in patients with CrCl <10 mL/min, and, because drug effects on serum sodium levels are likely lost at very low levels of renal function, use in patients with a CrCl <10 mL/min is not recommended. No benefit can be expected in patients who are anuric [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

There is no specific antidote for tolvaptan intoxication. The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose can be anticipated to be those of excessive pharmacologic effect: a rise in serum sodium concentration, polyuria, thirst, and dehydration/hypovolemia. No mortality was observed in rats or dogs following single oral doses of 2000 mg/kg (maximum feasible dose). A single oral dose of 2000 mg/kg was lethal in mice, and symptoms of toxicity in affected mice included decreased locomotor activity, staggering gait, tremor and hypothermia. In patients with suspected tolvaptan tablets overdosage, assessment of vital signs, electrolyte concentrations, ECG and fluid status are recommended. Continue replacement of water and electrolytes until aquaresis abates. Dialysis may not be effective in removing tolvaptan because of its high binding affinity for human plasma protein (>98%)."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolvaptan is a selective vasopressin V 2 -receptor antagonist with an affinity for the V 2 -receptor that is 1.8 times that of native arginine vasopressin (AVP). Tolvaptan affinity for the V 2 -receptor is 29 times greater than for the V 1a -receptor. When taken orally, 15 to 60 mg doses of tolvaptan antagonize the effect of vasopressin and cause an increase in urine water excretion that results in an increase in free water clearance (aquaresis), a decrease in urine osmolality, and a resulting increase in serum sodium concentrations. Urinary excretion of sodium and potassium and plasma potassium concentrations are not significantly changed. Tolvaptan metabolites have no or weak antagonist activity for human V 2 -receptors compared with tolvaptan. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In healthy subjects receiving a single dose of tolvaptan 60 mg, the onset of the aquaretic and sodium increasing effects occurs within 2 to 4 hours post-dose. A peak effect of about a 6 mEq increase in serum sodium and about 9 mL/min increase in urine excretion rate is observed between 4 and 8 hours post-dose; thus, the pharmacological activity lags behind the plasma concentrations of tolvaptan. About 60% of the peak effect on serum sodium is sustained at 24 hours post-dose, but the urinary excretion rate is no longer elevated by this time. Doses above 60 mg tolvaptan do not increase aquaresis or serum sodium further. The effects of tolvaptan in the recommended dose range of 15 to 60 mg once daily appear to be limited to aquaresis and the resulting increase in sodium concentration. Plasma concentrations of native AVP may increase (avg. 2 to 9 pg/mL) with tolvaptan administration. Cardiac Electrophysiology No prolongation of the QT interval was observed with tolvaptan following multiple doses of 300 mg/day for 5 days. In a parallel-arm, double-blind (for tolvaptan and placebo), placebo- and positive-controlled, multiple dose study of the effect of tolvaptan on the QTc interval, 172 healthy subjects were randomized to tolvaptan 30 mg, tolvaptan 300 mg, placebo, or moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily. At both the 30 mg and 300 mg doses, no significant effect of administering tolvaptan on the QTc interval was detected on Day 1 and Day 5. At the 300 mg dose, peak tolvaptan plasma concentrations were approximately 4\u2011fold higher than the peak concentrations following a 30 mg dose. Moxifloxacin increased the QT interval by 12 ms at 2 hours after dosing on Day 1 and 17 ms at 1 hour after dosing on Day 5, indicating that the study was adequately designed and conducted to detect tolvaptan's effect on the QT interval, had an effect been present. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of tolvaptan after single doses of up to 480 mg and multiple doses up to 300 mg once daily have been examined. In hyponatremia subjects, single and multiple doses up to 60 mg have been studied. Absorption In healthy subjects, peak concentrations of tolvaptan are observed between 2 and 4 hours post-dose. Peak concentrations increase less than dose proportionally with doses greater than 240 mg. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan decreases with increasing doses. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan following an oral dose of 30 mg is 56% (range 42 to 80%). Co-administration of 90 mg tolvaptan with a high-fat meal (~1000 calories, of which 50% are from fat) doubles peak concentrations but has no effect on the AUC of tolvaptan; tolvaptan may be administered with or without food. Distribution Tolvaptan binds to both albumin and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein and the overall protein binding is >98%; binding is not affected by disease state. The volume of distribution of tolvaptan is about 3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetic properties of tolvaptan are stereospecific, with a steady-state ratio of the S-(-) to the R-(+) enantiomer of about 3. When administered as multiple once-daily 300 mg doses to healthy subjects or to patients with congestive heart failure or ADPKD, tolvaptan\u2019s accumulation factor is <1.2. There is marked inter-subject variation in peak and average exposure to tolvaptan with a percent coefficient of variation ranging between 30 and 60%. Metabolism and Elimination Tolvaptan is metabolized almost exclusively by CYP3A. Fourteen metabolites have been identified in plasma, urine and feces; all but one were also metabolized by CYP3A and none are pharmacodynamically active. After oral administration of radiolabeled tolvaptan, tolvaptan was a minor component in plasma, representing 3% of total plasma radioactivity; the oxobutyric acid metabolite was present at 52.5% of total plasma radioactivity with all other metabolites present at lower concentrations than tolvaptan. The oxobutyric acid metabolite shows a plasma half-life of ~180 h. About 40% of radioactivity was recovered in urine (<1% as unchanged tolvaptan) and 59% in feces (19% as unchanged tolvaptan). Following intravenous infusion, tolvaptan half-life is approximately 3 hours. Following single oral doses to healthy subjects, the estimated half-life of tolvaptan increases from 3 hours for a 15 mg dose to approximately 12 hours for 120 mg and higher doses due to more prolonged absorption of tolvaptan at higher doses; apparent clearance is approximately 4 mL/min/kg and does not appear to change with increasing dose. Specific Populations Hyponatremia In patients with hyponatremia of any origin the clearance of tolvaptan is reduced to about 2 mL/min/kg. Hepatic Impairment Moderate or severe hepatic impairment or congestive heart failure decrease the clearance and increase the volume of distribution of tolvaptan, but the respective changes are not clinically relevant. Exposure and response to tolvaptan in subjects with creatinine clearance ranging between 79 and 10 mL/min and patients with normal renal function are not different. Renal Impairment In a study in patients with creatinine clearances ranging from 10 to 124 mL/min administered a single dose of 60 mg tolvaptan, AUC and C max of plasma tolvaptan were less than doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) relative to the controls. The peak increase in serum sodium was 5 to 6 mEq/L, regardless of renal function, but the onset and offset of tolvaptan's effect on serum sodium were slower in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug Interaction Studies Impact of Other Drugs on Tolvaptan Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Ketoconazole: Tolvaptan\u2019s C max and AUC were, respectively, 3.5 times and 5.4 times as high following ketoconazole 200 mg given one day prior to and concomitantly with 30 mg tolvaptan [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors Fluconazole: Fluconazole 400 mg given one day prior and 200 mg given concomitantly produced an 80% and 200% increase in tolvaptan C max and AUC, respectively. Grapefruit Juice: Co-administration of grapefruit juice and tolvaptan results in an increase in C max and AUC of 90% and 60% for tolvaptan, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. CYP3A4 Inducers Rifampin: Rifampin 600 mg once daily for 7 days followed by a single 240 mg dose of tolvaptan decreased both tolvaptan C max and AUC about 85%. Other Drugs Co-administration of lovastatin, digoxin, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide with tolvaptan tablets has no clinically relevant impact on the exposure to tolvaptan. Impact of Tolvaptan on Other Drugs CYP3A Substrates Tolvaptan tablets are a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. Co-administration of lovastatin and tolvaptan tablets increases the exposure to lovastatin and its active metabolite lovastatin-\u03b2 hydroxyacid by factors of 1.4 and 1.3, respectively. This is not a clinically relevant change. P-gp Substrates Digoxin: Digoxin 0.25 mg was administered once daily for 12 days. Tolvaptan 60 mg, was co-administered once daily on Days 8 to 12. Digoxin C max and AUC were increased 30% and 20%, respectively. Transporter Substrates Tolvaptan is a substrate of P-gp and an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. The oxobutyric acid metabolite of tolvaptan is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OAT3. Co-administration of tolvaptan with rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) did not have a clinically significant effect on rosuvastatin exposure. Rosuvastatin C max and AUC t increased 54% and 69%, respectively. Administration of rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 substrate) or furosemide (OAT3 substrate) to healthy subjects with elevated oxobutyric acid metabolite plasma concentrations did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin or furosemide. Other Drugs Co-administration of tolvaptan does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, or amiodarone (or its active metabolite, desethylamiodarone) to a clinically significant degree."

Plasma concentrations of native AVP may increase (avg. 2 to 9 pg/mL) with tolvaptan administration. Cardiac Electrophysiology No prolongation of the QT interval was observed with tolvaptan following multiple doses of 300 mg/day for 5 days. In a parallel-arm, double-blind (for tolvaptan and placebo), placebo- and positive-controlled, multiple dose study of the effect of tolvaptan on the QTc interval, 172 healthy subjects were randomized to tolvaptan 30 mg, tolvaptan 300 mg, placebo, or moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily.

The peak increase in serum sodium was 5 to 6 mEq/L, regardless of renal function, but the onset and offset of tolvaptan's effect on serum sodium were slower in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug Interaction Studies Impact of Other Drugs on Tolvaptan Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Ketoconazole: Tolvaptan\u2019s C max and AUC were, respectively, 3.5 times and 5.4 times as high following ketoconazole 200 mg given one day prior to and concomitantly with 30 mg tolvaptan [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors Fluconazole: Fluconazole 400 mg given one day prior and 200 mg given concomitantly produced an 80% and 200% increase in tolvaptan C max and AUC, respectively. Grapefruit Juice: Co-administration of grapefruit juice and tolvaptan results in an increase in C max and AUC of 90% and 60% for tolvaptan, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. CYP3A4 Inducers Rifampin: Rifampin 600 mg once daily for 7 days followed by a single 240 mg dose of tolvaptan decreased both tolvaptan C max and AUC about 85%. Other Drugs Co-administration of lovastatin, digoxin, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide with tolvaptan tablets has no clinically relevant impact on the exposure to tolvaptan. Impact of Tolvaptan on Other Drugs CYP3A Substrates Tolvaptan tablets are a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. Co-administration of lovastatin and tolvaptan tablets increases the exposure to lovastatin and its active metabolite lovastatin-\u03b2 hydroxyacid by factors of 1.4 and 1.3, respectively. This is not a clinically relevant change. P-gp Substrates Digoxin: Digoxin 0.25 mg was administered once daily for 12 days. Tolvaptan 60 mg, was co-administered once daily on Days 8 to 12. Digoxin C max and AUC were increased 30% and 20%, respectively. Transporter Substrates Tolvaptan is a substrate of P-gp and an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. The oxobutyric acid metabolite of tolvaptan is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OAT3. Co-administration of tolvaptan with rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) did not have a clinically significant effect on rosuvastatin exposure. Rosuvastatin C max and AUC t increased 54% and 69%, respectively. Administration of rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 substrate) or furosemide (OAT3 substrate) to healthy subjects with elevated oxobutyric acid metabolite plasma concentrations did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin or furosemide. Other Drugs Co-administration of tolvaptan does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, or amiodarone (or its active metabolite, desethylamiodarone) to a clinically significant degree."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis The carcinogenic potential of tolvaptan was assessed in 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats. Tolvaptan did not increase tumors in male or female rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.24 to 3.26 times the exposure in CHF patients based on AUC at the MRHD of 60 mg), in male mice at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (0.3 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD) and to female mice at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (0.4 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD). Mutagenesis Tolvaptan was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells and in vivo rat micronucleus assay and was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assays. Impairment of fertility In a fertility study in which male and female rats were administered tolvaptan orally at 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg/day, altered estrous cycles due to prolongation of diestrus were observed in dams given 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day (6.2 and 11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the 60 mg dose). Tolvaptan had no effect on copulation or fertility indices. There were also no effects on the incidences of early or late resorption, dead fetuses, pre- or post-implantation loss, external anomalies, or fetal body weights."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hyponatremia In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies (SALT-1 and SALT-2), a total of 424 patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) resulting from a variety of underlying causes (heart failure, liver cirrhosis, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone [SIADH] and others) were treated for 30 days with tolvaptan or placebo, then followed for an additional 7 days after withdrawal. Symptomatic patients, patients likely to require saline therapy during the course of therapy, patients with acute and transient hyponatremia associated with head trauma or postoperative state and patients with hyponatremia due to primary polydipsia, uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency or uncontrolled hypothyroidism were excluded. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo (N = 220) or tolvaptan (N = 223) at an initial oral dose of 15 mg once daily. The mean serum sodium concentration at study entry was 129 mEq/L. Fluid restriction was to be avoided if possible during the first 24 hours of therapy to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, and during the first 24 hours of therapy 87% of patients had no fluid restriction. Thereafter, patients could resume or initiate fluid restriction (defined as daily fluid intake of \u22641.0 liter/day) as clinically indicated. The dose of tolvaptan could be increased at 24 hour intervals to 30 mg once daily, then to 60 mg once daily, until either the maximum dose of 60 mg or normonatremia (serum sodium >135 mEq/L) was reached. Serum sodium concentrations were determined at 8 hours after study drug initiation and daily up to 72 hours, within which time titration was typically completed. Treatment was maintained for 30 days with additional serum sodium assessments on Days 11, 18, 25 and 30. On the day of study discontinuation, all patients resumed previous therapies for hyponatremia and were reevaluated 7 days later. The primary endpoint for these studies was the average daily AUC for change in serum sodium from baseline to Day 4 and baseline to Day 30 in patients with a serum sodium less than 135 mEq/L. Compared to placebo, tolvaptan caused a statistically greater increase in serum sodium ( p <0.0001) during both periods in both studies (see Table 2 ). For patients with a serum sodium of <130 mEq/L or <125 mEq/L, the effects at Day 4 and Day 30 remained significant (see Table 2 ). This effect was also seen across all disease etiology subsets (e.g., CHF, cirrhosis, SIADH/other). Table 2.

The percentage of patients requiring fluid restriction (defined as \u22641 L/day at any time during the treatment period) was also significantly less (p = 0.0017) in the tolvaptan-treated group (30/215, 14%) as compared with the placebo-treated group (51/206, 25%). Figure 1 shows the change from baseline in serum sodium by visit in patients with serum sodium <135 mEq/L. Within 7 days of tolvaptan discontinuation, serum sodium concentrations in tolvaptan-treated patients declined to levels similar to those of placebo-treated patients.

By this time, their baseline mean serum sodium concentration had fallen to between their original baseline and post-placebo therapy level. Upon initiation of therapy, average serum sodium concentrations increased to approximately the same levels as observed for those previously treated with tolvaptan and were sustained for at least a year. Figure 3 shows results from 111 patients enrolled in the SALTWATER Study.

      "MEDICATION GUIDE Tolvaptan (tol vap' tan) Tablets Read the Medication Guide that comes with Tolvaptan Tablets before you take it and each time you get a new prescription. There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Share this important information with members of your household. What is the most important information I should know about tolvaptan tablets ? 1) Tolvaptan tablets may make the salt (sodium) level in your blood rise too fast. This can increase your risk of a serious condition called osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). ODS can lead to coma or death. ODS can also cause new symptoms such as: trouble speaking swallowing trouble or feeling like food or liquid gets stuck while swallowing drowsiness confusion mood changes trouble controlling body movement (involuntary movement) and weakness in muscles of the arms and legs seizures You or a family member should tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms even if they begin later in treatment. Also tell your healthcare provider about any other new symptoms while taking tolvaptan tablets. You may be more at risk for ODS if you have: liver disease not eaten enough for a long period of time (malnourished) very low sodium level in your blood been drinking large amounts of alcohol for a long period of time (chronic alcoholism) To lessen your risk of ODS while taking tolvaptan tablets: Treatment with tolvaptan tablets should be started and re-started only in a hospital, where the sodium levels in your blood can be checked closely. Do not take tolvaptan tablets if you cannot tell if you are thirsty. To prevent losing too much body water (dehydration), have water available to drink at all times while taking tolvaptan tablets. Unless your healthcare provider tells you otherwise, drink when you are thirsty. If your healthcare provider tells you to keep taking tolvaptan tablets after you leave a hospital, it is important that you do not stop and re-start tolvaptan tablets on your own. You may need to go back to a hospital to re-start tolvaptan tablets. Talk to your healthcare provider right away if you stop taking tolvaptan tablets for any reason. It is important to stay under the care of your healthcare provider while taking tolvaptan tablets and follow their instructions. 2) Tolvaptan tablets may cause liver problems, including life-threatening liver failure. Tolvaptan tablets should not be taken for more than 30 days. Tell your doctor right away if you develop or have worsening of any of these signs and symptoms of liver problems: Loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting Fever, feeling unwell, unusual tiredness Itching Yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice) Unusual darkening of the urine Right upper stomach area pain or discomfort 3) If you have autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), do not use Tolvaptan tablets because you should receive the medicine (tolvaptan) through a program that ensures laboratory monitoring of your liver. What are tolvaptan tablets ? Tolvaptan tablets are a prescription medicine used to help increase low sodium levels in the blood, in adults with conditions such as heart failure, and certain hormone imbalances.

Dosage may be increased at intervals \u226524 hr to 30 mg once daily, and to a maximum of 60 mg once daily as needed to raise serum sodium. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Patients should be in a hospital for initiation and re-initiation of therapy to evaluate the therapeutic response and because too rapid correction of hyponatremia can cause osmotic demyelination resulting in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma and death. The usual starting dose for tolvaptan tablets is 15 mg administered once daily without regard to meals. Increase the dose to 30 mg once daily, after at least 24 hours, to a maximum of 60 mg once daily, as needed to achieve the desired level of serum sodium. Do not administer tolvaptan tablets for more than 30 days to minimize the risk of liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. During initiation and titration, frequently monitor for changes in serum electrolytes and volume. Avoid fluid restriction during the first 24 hours of therapy. Patients receiving tolvaptan tablets should be advised that they can continue ingestion of fluid in response to thirst [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 2.2 Drug Withdrawal Following discontinuation from tolvaptan tablets, patients should be advised to resume fluid restriction and should be monitored for changes in serum sodium and volume status."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Liver injury: Limit treatment duration to 30 days. If hepatic injury is suspected, discontinue tolvaptan. Avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease (5.2) Dehydration and hypovolemia may require intervention ( 5.3 ) Avoid use with hypertonic saline ( 5.4 ) Avoid use with moderate to strong CYP3A inhibitors (5.5) Monitor serum potassium in patients with potassium >5 mEq/L or on drugs known to increase potassium ( 5.6 ) Urinary outflow obstruction: Urinary output must be secured (5.7) 5.1 Too Rapid Correction of Serum Sodium Can Cause Serious Neurologic Sequelae Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a risk associated with too rapid correction of hyponatremia (e.g., >12 mEq/L/24 hours). Osmotic demyelination results in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma or death. In susceptible patients, including those with severe malnutrition, alcoholism or advanced liver disease, slower rates of correction may be advisable. In controlled clinical trials in which tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses starting at 15 mg once daily, 7% of tolvaptan-treated subjects with a serum sodium <130 mEq/L had an increase in serum sodium greater than 8 mEq/L at approximately 8 hours and 2% had an increase greater than 12 mEq/L at 24 hours. Approximately 1% of placebo-treated subjects with a serum sodium <130 mEq/L had a rise greater than 8 mEq/L at 8 hours and no patient had a rise greater than 12 mEq/L/24 hours. Osmotic demyelination syndrome has been reported in association with tolvaptan therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Patients treated with tolvaptan should be monitored to assess serum sodium concentrations and neurologic status, especially during initiation and after titration. Subjects with SIADH or very low baseline serum sodium concentrations may be at greater risk for too-rapid correction of serum sodium. In patients receiving tolvaptan who develop too rapid a rise in serum sodium, discontinue or interrupt treatment with tolvaptan and consider administration of hypotonic fluid. Fluid restriction during the first 24 hours of therapy with tolvaptan may increase the likelihood of overly rapid correction of serum sodium and should generally be avoided. Co-administration of diuretics also increases the risk of too rapid correction of serum sodium and such patients should undergo close monitoring of serum sodium. 5.3 Dehydration and Hypovolemia Tolvaptan therapy induces copious aquaresis, which is normally partially offset by fluid intake. Dehydration and hypovolemia can occur, especially in potentially volume-depleted patients receiving diuretics or those who are fluid restricted. In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials in which 607 hyponatremic patients were treated with tolvaptan, the incidence of dehydration was 3.3% for tolvaptan and 1.5% for placebo-treated patients. In patients receiving tolvaptan who develop medically significant signs or symptoms of hypovolemia, interrupt or discontinue tolvaptan therapy and provide supportive care with careful management of vital signs, fluid balance and electrolytes. Fluid restriction during therapy with tolvaptan may increase the risk of dehydration and hypovolemia. Patients receiving tolvaptan should continue ingestion of fluid in response to thirst 5.2 Liver Injury Tolvaptan can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury. In placebo-controlled studies and an open-label extension study of chronically administered tolvaptan in patients with ADPKD, cases of serious liver injury attributed to tolvaptan, generally occurring during the first 18 months of therapy, were observed. In postmarketing experience with tolvaptan in ADPKD, acute injury resulting in liver failure requiring liver transplantation has been reported. Tolvaptan should not be used to treat ADPKD outside of the FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for ADPKD patients [ see Contraindications (4)]. Patients with symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice should discontinue treatment with tolvaptan. Limit duration of therapy with tolvaptan to 30 days. Avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease, including cirrhosis, because the ability to recover from liver injury may be impaired [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.4 Co-administration with Hypertonic Saline Concomitant use with hypertonic saline is not recommended. 5.5 Drug Interactions Tolvaptan is a substrate of CYP 3A. Moderate to strong CYP 3A inhibitors can lead to a marked increase in tolvaptan concentrations [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Do not use tolvaptan with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A [see Contraindications (4)] and avoid concomitant use with moderate CYP 3A inhibitors. 5.6 Hyperkalemia or Drugs that Increase Serum Potassium Treatment with tolvaptan is associated with an acute reduction of the extracellular fluid volume which could result in increased serum potassium. Serum potassium levels should be monitored after initiation of tolvaptan treatment in patients with a serum potassium >5 mEq/L as well as those who are receiving drugs known to increase serum potassium levels. 5.7 Acute Urinary Retention with Outflow Obstruction Patients with partial obstruction of urinary outflow, for example, patients with prostatic hypertrophy or impairment of micturition, have an increased risk of developing acute retention. Do not administer tolvaptan in patients with uncorrected urinary outflow obstruction."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22655% placebo) are thirst, dry mouth, asthenia, constipation, pollakiuria or polyuria, and hyperglycemia ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-ASC-RX01 (877-272-7901) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 ( www.fda.gov/medwatch ). 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse event information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials, 607 hyponatremic patients (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) were treated with tolvaptan. The mean age of these patients was 62 years; 70% of patients were male and 82% were Caucasian. One hundred eighty-nine (189) tolvaptan-treated patients had a serum sodium <130 mEq/L, and 52 patients had a serum sodium <125 mEq/L. Hyponatremia was attributed to cirrhosis in 17% of patients, heart failure in 68% and SIADH/other in 16%. Of these patients, 223 were treated with the recommended dose titration (15 mg titrated to 60 mg as needed to raise serum sodium). Overall, over 4,000 patients have been treated with oral doses of tolvaptan in open-label or placebo-controlled clinical trials. Approximately 650 of these patients had hyponatremia; approximately 219 of these hyponatremic patients were treated with tolvaptan for 6 months or more. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655% more than placebo) seen in two 30-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled hyponatremia trials in which tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses (15 mg to 60 mg once daily) were thirst, dry mouth, asthenia, constipation, pollakiuria or polyuria and hyperglycemia. In these trials, 10% (23/223) of tolvaptan-treated patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event, compared to 12% (26/220) of placebo-treated patients; no adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of trial medication occurred at an incidence of >1% in tolvaptan-treated patients. 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in tolvaptan-treated patients with hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) and at a rate at least 2% greater than placebo-treated patients in two 30-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In these studies, 223 patients were exposed to tolvaptan (starting dose 15 mg, titrated to 30 and 60 mg as needed to raise serum sodium). Adverse events resulting in death in these trials were 6% in tolvaptan-treated patients and 6% in placebo-treated patients. Table 1.

Gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis In patients with cirrhosis treated with tolvaptan in the hyponatremia trials, gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 6 out of 63 (10%) tolvaptan-treated patients and 1 out of 57 (2%) placebo treated patients. The following adverse reactions occurred in <2% of hyponatremic patients treated with tolvaptan and at a rate greater than placebo in double-blind placebo-controlled trials (N = 607 tolvaptan; N = 518 placebo) or in <2% of patients in an uncontrolled trial of patients with hyponatremia (N = 111) and are not mentioned elsewhere in the label.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Neurologic: Osmotic demyelination syndrome Investigations: Hypernatremia Removal of excess free body water increases serum osmolality and serum sodium concentrations. All patients treated with tolvaptan, especially those whose serum sodium levels become normal, should continue to be monitored to ensure serum sodium remains within normal limits. If hypernatremia is observed, management may include dose decreases or interruption of tolvaptan treatment, combined with modification of free-water intake or infusion. During clinical trials of hyponatremic patients, hypernatremia was reported as an adverse event in 0.7% of patients receiving tolvaptan vs. 0.6% of patients receiving placebo; analysis of laboratory values demonstrated an incidence of hypernatremia of 1.7% in patients receiving tolvaptan vs. 0.8% in patients receiving placebo.

Concomitant use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors A substantial increase in the exposure to tolvaptan would be expected when tolvaptan is co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid co-administration of tolvaptan with moderate CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Patients should avoid grapefruit juice beverages while taking tolvaptan [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Strong CYP3A Inducers Co-administration of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inducers reduces exposure to tolvaptan [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended (8.2) Pediatric Use: There are no studies ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data with tolvaptan use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Tolvaptan did not cause any developmental toxicity in rats or in rabbits at exposures approximately 2.8 and 0.8 times, respectively, the exposure in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 60 mg once daily. However, effects on embryo-fetal development occurred in both species at doses causing significant maternally toxic doses. In rats, reduced fetal weights and delayed fetal ossification occurred at 11 times the exposure in CHF patients, based on AUC. In rabbits, increased abortions, embryo-fetal death, fetal microphthalmia, open eyelids, cleft palate, brachymelia and skeletal malformations occurred at approximately 1.6 times the exposure in CHF patients (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tolvaptan during the period of organogenesis in Sprague-Dawley rats produced no evidence of teratogenesis at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. Delayed ossification was seen at 1,000 mg/kg, which is approximately 11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg (AUC 24h 10271 ng*h/mL). The fetal effects are likely secondary to maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and low body weights). In a prenatal and postnatal study in rats, tolvaptan had no effect on physical development, reflex function, learning ability or reproductive performance at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg). In rabbits, teratogenicity (microphthalmia, embryo-fetal mortality, cleft palate, brachymelia and skeletal malformations) was observed in rabbits at 1,000 mg/kg (approximately 1.6 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg dose). This dose also caused maternal toxicity (lower body weight gains and food consumption). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tolvaptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Tolvaptan is present in rat milk (see Data). When a drug is present in animal milk, it is possible that the drug will be present in human milk, but relative levels may vary (see Data) . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypernatremia), hypotension, and volume depletion in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with tolvaptan. Data In lactating rats administered radiolabeled tolvaptan, lacteal radioactivity concentrations reached the highest level at 8 hours after administration and then decreased gradually with time with a half-life of 27.3 hours. The level of activity in milk ranged from 1.5-to 15.8-fold those in maternal blood over a period of 72 hours post-dose. Increased perinatal death and decreased body weight of the offspring were observed during the lactation period and after weaning at approximately 11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD of 60 mg. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of tolvaptan in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of hyponatremic subjects treated with tolvaptan in clinical studies, 42% were 65 years old and over, while 19% were 75 years old and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Increasing age has no effect on tolvaptan plasma concentrations. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Moderate and severe hepatic impairment do not affect exposure to tolvaptan to a clinically relevant extent. Avoid use of tolvaptan in patients with underlying liver disease. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary based on renal function. There are no clinical trial data in patients with CrCl <10 mL/min, and, because drug effects on serum sodium levels are likely lost at very low levels of renal function, use in patients with a CrCl <10 mL/min is not recommended. No benefit can be expected in patients who are anuric [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

There is no specific antidote for tolvaptan intoxication. The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose can be anticipated to be those of excessive pharmacologic effect: a rise in serum sodium concentration, polyuria, thirst, and dehydration/hypovolemia. No mortality was observed in rats or dogs following single oral doses of 2,000 mg/kg (maximum feasible dose). A single oral dose of 2,000 mg/kg was lethal in mice, and symptoms of toxicity in affected mice included decreased locomotor activity, staggering gait, tremor and hypothermia. In patients with suspected tolvaptan overdosage, assessment of vital signs, electrolyte concentrations, ECG and fluid status are recommended. Continue replacement of water and electrolytes until aquaresis abates. Dialysis may not be effective in removing tolvaptan because of its high binding affinity for human plasma protein (>98%)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tolvaptan is a selective vasopressin V 2 -receptor antagonist with an affinity for the V 2 -receptor that is 1.8 times that of native arginine vasopressin (AVP). Tolvaptan affinity for the V 2 -receptor is 29 times greater than for the V 1a -receptor. When taken orally, 15 to 60 mg doses of tolvaptan antagonize the effect of vasopressin and cause an increase in urine water excretion that results in an increase in free water clearance (aquaresis), a decrease in urine osmolality, and a resulting increase in serum sodium concentrations. Urinary excretion of sodium and potassium and plasma potassium concentrations are not significantly changed. Tolvaptan metabolites have no or weak antagonist activity for human V 2 -receptors compared with tolvaptan. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In healthy subjects receiving a single dose of tolvaptan 60 mg, the onset of the aquaretic and sodium increasing effects occurs within 2 to 4 hours post-dose. A peak effect of about a 6 mEq increase in serum sodium and about 9 mL/min increase in urine excretion rate is observed between 4 and 8 hours post-dose; thus, the pharmacological activity lags behind the plasma concentrations of tolvaptan. About 60% of the peak effect on serum sodium is sustained at 24 hours post-dose, but the urinary excretion rate is no longer elevated by this time. Doses above 60 mg tolvaptan do not increase aquaresis or serum sodium further. The effects of tolvaptan in the recommended dose range of 15 to 60 mg once daily appear to be limited to aquaresis and the resulting increase in sodium concentration. Plasma concentrations of native AVP may increase (avg. 2 to 9 pg/mL) with tolvaptan administration. Cardiac Electrophysiology No prolongation of the QT interval was observed with tolvaptan following multiple doses of 300 mg/day for 5 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of tolvaptan after single doses of up to 480 mg and multiple doses up to 300 mg once daily have been examined. In hyponatremia subjects, single and multiple doses up to 60 mg have been studied. Absorption In healthy subjects, peak concentrations of tolvaptan are observed between 2 and 4 hours post-dose. Peak concentrations increase less than dose proportionally with doses greater than 240 mg. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan decreases with increasing doses. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan following an oral dose of 30 mg is 56% (range 42 to 80%). Co-administration of 90 mg tolvaptan with a high-fat meal (~1,000 calories, of which 50% are from fat) doubles peak concentrations but has no effect on the AUC of tolvaptan; tolvaptan may be administered with or without food. Distribution Tolvaptan binds to both albumin and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein and the overall protein binding is >98%; binding is not affected by disease state. The volume of distribution of tolvaptan is about 3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetic properties of tolvaptan are stereospecific, with a steady-state ratio of the S-(-) to the R-(+) enantiomer of about 3. When administered as multiple once-daily 300 mg doses to healthy subjects or to patients with congestive heart failure or ADPKD, tolvaptan\u2019s accumulation factor is <1.2. There is marked inter-subject variation in peak and average exposure to tolvaptan with a percent coefficient of variation ranging between 30 and 60%. Metabolism and Elimination Tolvaptan is metabolized almost exclusively by CYP3A. Fourteen metabolites have been identified in plasma, urine and feces; all but one were also metabolized by CYP3A and none are pharmacodynamically active. After oral administration of radiolabeled tolvaptan, tolvaptan was a minor component in plasma, representing 3% of total plasma radioactivity; the oxobutyric acid metabolite was present at 52.5% of total plasma radioactivity with all other metabolites present at lower concentrations than tolvaptan. The oxobutyric acid metabolite shows a plasma half-life of ~180 h. About 40% of radioactivity was recovered in urine (<1% as unchanged tolvaptan) and 59% in feces (19% as unchanged tolvaptan). Following intravenous infusion, tolvaptan half-life is approximately 3 hours. Following single oral doses to healthy subjects, the estimated half-life of tolvaptan increases from 3 hours for a 15 mg dose to approximately 12 hours for 120 mg and higher doses due to more prolonged absorption of tolvaptan at higher doses; apparent clearance is approximately 4 mL/min/kg and does not appear to change with increasing dose. Specific Populations Hyponatremia In patients with hyponatremia of any origin the clearance of tolvaptan is reduced to about 2 mL/min/kg. Hepatic Impairment Moderate or severe hepatic impairment or congestive heart failure decrease the clearance and increase the volume of distribution of tolvaptan, but the respective changes are not clinically relevant. Exposure and response to tolvaptan in subjects with creatinine clearance ranging between 79 and 10 mL/min and patients with normal renal function are not different. Renal Impairment In a study in patients with creatinine clearances ranging from 10 to 124 mL/min administered a single dose of 60 mg tolvaptan, AUC and C max of plasma tolvaptan were less than doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) relative to the controls. The peak increase in serum sodium was 5 to 6 mEq/L, regardless of renal function, but the onset and offset of tolvaptan's effect on serum sodium were slower in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Drug Interaction Studies Impact of Other Drugs on Tolvaptan Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Ketoconazole: Tolvaptan\u2019s C max and AUC were, respectively, 3.5 times and 5.4 times as high following ketoconazole 200 mg given one day prior to and concomitantly with 30 mg tolvaptan [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors Fluconazole: Fluconazole 400 mg given one day prior and 200 mg given concomitantly produced an 80% and 200% increase in tolvaptan C max and AUC, respectively. Grapefruit Juice: Co-administration of grapefruit juice and tolvaptan results in an increase in C max and AUC of 90% and 60% for tolvaptan, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. CYP3A4 Inducers Rifampin: Rifampin 600 mg once daily for 7 days followed by a single 240 mg dose of tolvaptan decreased both tolvaptan C max and AUC about 85%. Other Drugs Co-administration of lovastatin, digoxin, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide with tolvaptan has no clinically relevant impact on the exposure to tolvaptan. Impact of Tolvaptan on Other Drugs CYP3A Substrates Tolvaptan is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. Co-administration of lovastatin and tolvaptan increases the exposure to lovastatin and its active metabolite lovastatin-\u03b2 hydroxyacid by factors of 1.4 and 1.3, respectively. This is not a clinically relevant change. P-gp Substrates Digoxin: Digoxin 0.25 mg was administered once daily for 12 days. Tolvaptan 60 mg, was co-administered once daily on Days 8 to 12. Digoxin C max and AUC were increased 30% and 20%, respectively. Transporter Substrates Tolvaptan is a substrate of P-gp and an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. The oxobutyric acid metabolite of tolvaptan is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OAT3. Co-administration of tolvaptan with rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) did not have a clinically significant effect on rosuvastatin exposure. Rosuvastatin Cmax and AUCt increased 54% and 69%, respectively. Administration of rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 substrate) or furosemide (OAT3 substrate) to healthy subjects with elevated oxobutyric acid metabolite plasma concentrations did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin or furosemide. Other Drugs Co-administration of tolvaptan does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, or amiodarone (or its active metabolite, desethylamiodarone) to a clinically significant degree."

Tolvaptan did not increase tumors in male or female rats at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (1.24 to 3.26 times the exposure in CHF patients based on AUC at the MRHD of 60 mg), in male mice at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (0.3 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD) and to female mice at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (0.4 times the exposure in CHF patients at the MRHD). Mutagenesis Tolvaptan was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells or the in vivo rat micronucleus assay and was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assays. Impairment of fertility In a fertility study in which male and female rats were administered tolvaptan orally at 100, 300 or 1,000 mg/kg/day, altered estrous cycles due to prolongation of diestrus were observed in dams given 300 and 1,000 mg/kg/day (6.2 and 11 times the exposure in CHF patients at the 60 mg dose). Tolvaptan had no effect on copulation or fertility indices. There were also no effects on the incidences of early or late resorption, dead fetuses, pre-or post-implantation loss, external anomalies, or fetal body weights."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hyponatremia In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies (SALT-1 and SALT-2), a total of 424 patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) resulting from a variety of underlying causes (heart failure, liver cirrhosis, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone [SIADH] and others) were treated for 30 days with tolvaptan or placebo, then followed for an additional 7 days after withdrawal. Symptomatic patients, patients likely to require saline therapy during the course of therapy, patients with acute and transient hyponatremia associated with head trauma or postoperative state and patients with hyponatremia due to primary polydipsia, uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency or uncontrolled hypothyroidism were excluded. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo (N = 220) or tolvaptan (N = 223) at an initial oral dose of 15 mg once daily. The mean serum sodium concentration at study entry was 129 mEq/L. Fluid restriction was to be avoided if possible during the first 24 hours of therapy to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, and during the first 24 hours of therapy 87% of patients had no fluid restriction. Thereafter, patients could resume or initiate fluid restriction (defined as daily fluid intake of \u22641.0 liter/day) as clinically indicated. The dose of tolvaptan could be increased at 24-hour intervals to 30 mg once daily, then to 60 mg once daily, until either the maximum dose of 60 mg or normonatremia (serum sodium >135 mEq/L) was reached. Serum sodium concentrations were determined at 8 hours after study drug initiation and daily up to 72 hours, within which time titration was typically completed. Treatment was maintained for 30 days with additional serum sodium assessments on Days 11, 18, 25 and 30. On the day of study discontinuation, all patients resumed previous therapies for hyponatremia and were reevaluated 7 days later. The primary endpoint for these studies was the average daily AUC for change in serum sodium from baseline to Day 4 and baseline to Day 30 in patients with a serum sodium less than 135 mEq/L. Compared to placebo, tolvaptan caused a statistically greater increase in serum sodium ( p <0.0001) during both periods in both studies (see Table 2). For patients with a serum sodium of <130 mEq/L or <125 mEq/L, the effects at Day 4 and Day 30 remained significant (see Table 2). This effect was also seen across all disease etiology subsets (e.g., CHF, cirrhosis, SIADH/other). Table 2.

In patients with hyponatremia (defined as <135 mEq/L), serum sodium concentration increased to a significantly greater degree in tolvaptan-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients as early as 8 hours after the first dose, and the change was maintained for 30 days. The percentage of patients requiring fluid restriction (defined as \u22641 L/day at any time during the treatment period) was also significantly less (p =0.0017) in the tolvaptan-treated group (30/215, 14%) as compared with the placebo-treated group (51/206, 25%). Figure 1 shows the change from baseline in serum sodium by visit in patients with serum sodium <135 mEq/L. Within 7 days of tolvaptan discontinuation, serum sodium concentrations in tolvaptan-treated patients declined to levels similar to those of placebo-treated patients. Figure 1: Pooled SALT Studies: Analysis of Mean Serum Sodium (\u00b1 SD, mEq/L) by Visit - Patients with Baseline Serum Sodium <135 mEq/L *p-value <0.0001 for all visits during tolvaptan treatment compared to placebo Figure 2: Pooled SALT Studies: Analysis of Mean Serum Sodium (\u00b1 SD, mEq/L) by Visit - Patients with Baseline Serum Sodium <130 mEq/L *p-value <0.0001 for all visits during tolvaptan treatment compared to placebo In the open-label study SALTWATER, 111 patients, 94 of them hyponatremic (serum sodium <135 mEq/L), previously on tolvaptan or placebo therapy, were given tolvaptan as a titrated regimen (15 to 60 mg once daily) after having returned to standard care for at least 7 days. By this time, their baseline mean serum sodium concentration had fallen to between their original baseline and post-placebo therapy level. Upon initiation of therapy, average serum sodium concentrations increased to approximately the same levels as observed for those previously treated with tolvaptan and were sustained for at least a year. Figure 3 shows results from 111 patients enrolled in the SALTWATER Study. Figure 3: SALTWATER: Analysis of Mean Serum Sodium (\u00b1 SD, mEq/L) by Visit *p-value <0.0001 for all visits during tolvaptan treatment compared to baseline 14.2 Heart Failure In a phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study (EVEREST), 4,133 patients with worsening heart failure were randomized to tolvaptan or placebo as an adjunct to standard of care. Long\u00ad-term tolvaptan treatment (mean duration of treatment of 0.75 years) had no demonstrated effect, either favorable or unfavorable, on all-cause mortality [HR (95% CI): 0.98 (0.9, 1.1)] or the combined endpoint of CV mortality or subsequent hospitalization for worsening HF [HR (95% CI): 1.0 (0.9, 1.1)]."
