    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.1 ) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient's need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient's risk factors for overdose. ( 2.2 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a dosing range of 2.5 mL to 10 mL, 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. ( 2 , 5 ) Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. ( 2 , 5 ) Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride in a physically-dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. ( 2.7 , 5.14 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between mg and mL, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed. When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume. Instruct patients and caregivers on how to accurately measure and take or administer the correct dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Strongly advise patients and caregivers to always use a graduated oral syringe or measuring cup, with metric units of measurements (i.e., mL), to correctly measure the prescribed amount of medication. Inform patients and caregivers that oral dosing devices may be obtained from their pharmacy and to never use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solutions and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (2.1 , 5) ]. Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a dosing range of 2.5 mL to 10 mL, 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . 2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4) ] . Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. 2.3 Initial Dosage Initiating Treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a dosing range of 2.5 mL to 10 mL, 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. In general, it is safest to start hydromorphone hydrochloride therapy by administering half of the usual starting dose every 3 to 6 hours for hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution; and every 4 to 6 hours for hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. The dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride can be gradually adjusted until adequate pain relief and acceptable side effects have been achieved [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Conversion from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to Extended-Release Hydromorphone Hydrochloride The relative bioavailability of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets compared to extended-release hydromorphone is unknown, so conversion to extended-release hydromorphone may lead to increased risk of excessive sedation and respiratory depression. 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.5 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.6 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.14) ] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. A supplemental dose of 5 to 15% of the total daily usage may be administered every two hours on an as-needed basis. 2.7 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid dependent patient taking hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] ."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation. ( 5.7 ) Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Regularly evaluate patients, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.8 ) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.9 ) Severe Hypotension: Regularly evaluate patients during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.10 ) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor patients for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. Avoid dosing errors that may result from confusion between mg and mL and confusion with other hydromorphone oral solutions of different concentrations, when prescribing, dispensing, and administering hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. Instruct patients and caregivers on how to measure and take or administer the correct dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and to use extreme caution when measuring the dose. Strongly advise patients and caregivers to obtain and always use a graduated device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and to never use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure a dose because these are not accurate measuring devices. 5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, and reassess all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and the proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10) ] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered. Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.4) , Overdosage (10) ]. 5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate then on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Overdosage (10) ]. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.6 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG . Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com . The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint . 5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3) ]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . 5.8 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution- or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and when hydromorphone hydrochloride is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4) , Drug Interactions (7) ] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.9 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.10 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, hydromorphone hydrochloride may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.12 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.13 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets therapy. 5.14 Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]. Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and know how they will react to the medication. 5.16 Sulfites Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sulfite-containing medications."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Interactions with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Severe Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] Most common adverse reactions are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rhodes Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-827-0616 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Serious adverse reactions associated with hydromorphone hydrochloride include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Less Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations Eye disorders: vision blurred, diplopia, miosis, visual impairment Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, ileus, diarrhea, abdominal pain General disorders and administration site conditions: weakness, feeling abnormal , chills Hepatobiliary disorders: biliary colic Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle rigidity Nervous system disorders: headache, tremor, paraesthesia, nystagmus, increased intracranial pressure, syncope, taste alteration , involuntary muscle contractions, presyncope Psychiatric disorders: agitation, mood altered, nervousness, anxiety , depression, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia, abnormal dreams Renal and urinary disorders : urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: bronchospasm, laryngospasm Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria, rash, hyperhidrosis Vascular disorders: flushing, hypotension, hypertension 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of hydromorphone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Confusional state, convulsions, drowsiness, dyskinesia, dyspnea, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, hepatic enzymes increased, hyperalgesia, hypersensitivity reaction, lethargy, myoclonus, oropharyngeal swelling, peripheral edema, and somnolence. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Hypoglycemia: Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor (e.g., diabetes)."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with hydromorphone hydrochloride. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with HYDROMORPHONE HYDROCHLORIDE Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4) ] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: Phenelzine, tranylcypromine, and linezolid. Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: Butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, and buprenorphine. Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4) ]. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) : Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with hydromorphone hydrochloride because they may reduce analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. There are no available data with hydromorphone hydrochloride in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data ]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of hydromorphone hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and regularly evaluated during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be regularly evaluated during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. There are no available data with hydromorphone hydrochloride in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data ]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of hydromorphone hydrochloride abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use hydromorphone hydrochloride in combination with other abused drugs. \"Drug-seeking\" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \"loss\" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \"Doctor shopping\" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone hydrochloride, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of hydromorphone hydrochloride with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are approved for oral use only. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.6) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.3 , 2.6) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of hydromorphone hydrochloride is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-24 ) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the hydromorphone hydrochloride 8 mg tablet and an equivalent dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution has been demonstrated. After oral administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1 hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T \u00bd (hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) 8 mg Oral Liquid 5.7 (31%) 0.73 (71%) 24.6 (29%) 2.8 (20%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered C max by 25%, prolonged T max by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8 to 19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.6) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.3 , 2.6) ] ."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of hydromorphone hydrochloride is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-24 ) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the hydromorphone hydrochloride 8 mg tablet and an equivalent dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution has been demonstrated. After oral administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1 hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T \u00bd (hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) 8 mg Oral Liquid 5.7 (31%) 0.73 (71%) 24.6 (29%) 2.8 (20%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered C max by 25%, prolonged T max by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8 to 19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] , reserve hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products): \u2022 Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated, \u2022 Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories contain hydromorphone, an opioid agonist, and are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use ( 1 ) Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses, reserve hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products): \u2022 Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated, \u2022 Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia"

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. \u2022 Individualize dosing based on the severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient\u2019s need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose. ( 2.2 , 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.4 ) \u2022 Usual adult dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories is 1 suppository every 6 to 8 hours. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in a physically-dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are available in one strength: 3 mg. \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . \u2022 Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . \u2022 Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories and adjust the dosage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.4 )]. Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. 2.3 Dosing Initiating Treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Suppositories Initiate treatment with 1 hydromorphone hydrochloride suppository every 6 to 8 hours. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Suppositories There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. Conversion from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Suppositories to Extended-Release Hydromorphone Hydrochloride The relative bioavailability of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories compared to extended-release hydromorphone hydrochloride is unknown, so conversion to extended-release tablets must be accompanied by close observation for signs of excessive sedation and respiratory depression. 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.5 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.6 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. For chronic pain, doses should be administered around-the-clock. A supplemental dose of 5 to 15% of the total daily usage may be administered every two hours on an as-needed basis. 2.7 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Suppositories Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid dependent patient taking hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Adrenal Insufficiency : If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Severe Hypotension : Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )] . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, and monitor all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are essential [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] . Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . 5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. 5.5 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease : Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories and when hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.6 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.7 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. In patients with circulatory shock hydromorphone hydrochloride may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in patients with circulatory shock. 5.8 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.10 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories therapy. 5.11 Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] . Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.12 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories and know how they will react to the medication. 5.13 Sulfites Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sulfite-containing medications."

Serious adverse reactions associated with hydromorphone hydrochloride include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Less Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations Eye disorders: vision blurred, diplopia, miosis, visual impairment Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, ileus, diarrhea, abdominal pain General disorders and administration site conditions: weakness, feeling abnormal, chills Hepatobiliary disorders: biliary colic Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle rigidity Nervous system disorders: headache, tremor, paraesthesia, nystagmus, increased intracranial pressure, syncope, taste alteration, involuntary muscle contractions, presyncope Psychiatric disorders: agitation, mood altered, nervousness, anxiety, depression, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia, abnormal dreams Renal and urinary disorders: urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: bronchospasm, laryngospasm Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria, rash, hyperhidrosis Vascular disorders: flushing, hypotension, hypertension 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of hydromorphone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Confusional state, convulsions, drowsiness, dyskinesia, dyspnea, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, hepatic enzymes increased, hyperalgesia, hypersensitivity reaction, lethargy, myoclonus, oropharyngeal swelling, peripheral edema, and somnolence. Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] ."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with hydromorphone hydrochloride. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.4 )] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of skeletal muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.4 )]. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. \u2022 Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) \u2022 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) \u2022 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories because they may reduce analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . There are no available data with hydromorphone hydrochloride in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data] . Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or non-medical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high-pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of hydromorphone hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . There are no available data with hydromorphone hydrochloride in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data] . Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or non-medical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high-pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories contain hydromorphone, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, morphine, oxymorphone and tapentadol. Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. Hydromorphone hydrochloride, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are for rectal use only. Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence is a physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after a period of regular exposure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.6 )] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.6 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of hydromorphone hydrochloride is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-24 ) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). After oral administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1 hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T\u00bd (hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) 8 mg Oral Liquid 5.7 (31%) 0.73 (71%) 24.6 (29%) 2.8 (20%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered C max by 25%, prolonged T max by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8 to 19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC \u221e ) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone ( C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.6 )] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.6 )] ."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of hydromorphone hydrochloride is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-24 ) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). After oral administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1 hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T\u00bd (hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) 8 mg Oral Liquid 5.7 (31%) 0.73 (71%) 24.6 (29%) 2.8 (20%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered C max by 25%, prolonged T max by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8 to 19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC \u221e ) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone ( C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.1 ) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient's need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient's risk factors for overdose. ( 2.2 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a dosing range of 2.5 mL to 10 mL, 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. ( 2 , 5 ) Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. ( 2 , 5 ) Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride in a physically-dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. ( 2.7 , 5.14 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between mg and mL, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed. When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume. Instruct patients and caregivers on how to accurately measure and take or administer the correct dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Strongly advise patients and caregivers to always use a graduated oral syringe or measuring cup, with metric units of measurements (i.e., mL), to correctly measure the prescribed amount of medication. Inform patients and caregivers that oral dosing devices may be obtained from their pharmacy and to never use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solutions and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (2.1 , 5) ]. Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a dosing range of 2.5 mL to 10 mL, 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . 2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4) ] . Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. 2.3 Initial Dosage Initiating Treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a dosing range of 2.5 mL to 10 mL, 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. In general, it is safest to start hydromorphone hydrochloride therapy by administering half of the usual starting dose every 3 to 6 hours for hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution; and every 4 to 6 hours for hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. The dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride can be gradually adjusted until adequate pain relief and acceptable side effects have been achieved [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Conversion from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to Extended-Release Hydromorphone Hydrochloride The relative bioavailability of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets compared to extended-release hydromorphone is unknown, so conversion to extended-release hydromorphone may lead to increased risk of excessive sedation and respiratory depression. 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.5 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.6 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.14) ] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. A supplemental dose of 5 to 15% of the total daily usage may be administered every two hours on an as-needed basis. 2.7 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid dependent patient taking hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation. ( 5.7 ) Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Regularly evaluate patients, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.8 ) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.9 ) Severe Hypotension: Regularly evaluate patients during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.10 ) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor patients for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. Avoid dosing errors that may result from confusion between mg and mL and confusion with other hydromorphone oral solutions of different concentrations, when prescribing, dispensing, and administering hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. Instruct patients and caregivers on how to measure and take or administer the correct dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and to use extreme caution when measuring the dose. Strongly advise patients and caregivers to obtain and always use a graduated device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and to never use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure a dose because these are not accurate measuring devices. 5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, and reassess all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and the proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10) ] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered. Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.4) , Overdosage (10) ]. 5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate then on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Overdosage (10) ]. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.6 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG . Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com . The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint . 5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3) ]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . 5.8 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution- or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and when hydromorphone hydrochloride is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4) , Drug Interactions (7) ] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.9 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.10 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, hydromorphone hydrochloride may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.12 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.13 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets therapy. 5.14 Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]. Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and know how they will react to the medication. 5.16 Sulfites Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sulfite-containing medications."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rhodes Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-827-0616 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Serious adverse reactions associated with hydromorphone hydrochloride include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Less Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations Eye disorders: vision blurred, diplopia, miosis, visual impairment Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, ileus, diarrhea, abdominal pain General disorders and administration site conditions: weakness, feeling abnormal , chills Hepatobiliary disorders: biliary colic Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle rigidity Nervous system disorders: headache, tremor, paraesthesia, nystagmus, increased intracranial pressure, syncope, taste alteration , involuntary muscle contractions, presyncope Psychiatric disorders: agitation, mood altered, nervousness, anxiety , depression, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia, abnormal dreams Renal and urinary disorders : urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: bronchospasm, laryngospasm Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria, rash, hyperhidrosis Vascular disorders: flushing, hypotension, hypertension 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of hydromorphone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Confusional state, convulsions, drowsiness, dyskinesia, dyspnea, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, hepatic enzymes increased, hyperalgesia, hypersensitivity reaction, lethargy, myoclonus, oropharyngeal swelling, peripheral edema, and somnolence. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ].

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with hydromorphone hydrochloride. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with HYDROMORPHONE HYDROCHLORIDE Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4) ] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: Phenelzine, tranylcypromine, and linezolid. Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: Butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, and buprenorphine. Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4) ]. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) : Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with hydromorphone hydrochloride because they may reduce analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. There are no available data with hydromorphone hydrochloride in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data ]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of hydromorphone hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and regularly evaluated during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be regularly evaluated during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of hydromorphone hydrochloride abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use hydromorphone hydrochloride in combination with other abused drugs. \"Drug-seeking\" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \"loss\" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \"Doctor shopping\" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone hydrochloride, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of hydromorphone hydrochloride with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are approved for oral use only. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.6) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.3 , 2.6) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of hydromorphone hydrochloride is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-24 ) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the hydromorphone hydrochloride 8 mg tablet and an equivalent dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution has been demonstrated. After oral administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1 hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T \u00bd (hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) 8 mg Oral Liquid 5.7 (31%) 0.73 (71%) 24.6 (29%) 2.8 (20%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered C max by 25%, prolonged T max by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8 to 19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.6) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.3 , 2.6) ] ."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of hydromorphone hydrochloride is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-24 ) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the hydromorphone hydrochloride 8 mg tablet and an equivalent dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution has been demonstrated.

Assess each patient\u2019s risk prior to prescribing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a REMS for these products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to complete a REMS-compliant education program, counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products, emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacist, and consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety. Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets or following a dose increase [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Accidental Ingestion Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of hydromorphone [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Reserve concomitant prescribing of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

      "1 INDICATIONS & USAGE Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )], reserve Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]: Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated, Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain hydromorphone, an opioid agonist, and are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use ( 1 ) Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, reserve Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products: \u2022 Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, \u2022 Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia"
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Individualize dosing based on the severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 ) Usual adult starting dose for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours. ( 2.2) Hepatic Impairment: Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of hepatic impairment. ( 2.3 ) Renal Impairment: Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of renal impairment. ( 2.4 ) Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a physically-dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide ( 2.6) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. 2.2 Initial Dosage Initiating Treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Initiate treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. In general, it is safest to start Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets therapy by administering half of the usual starting dose every 4 to 6 hours for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. The dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets can be gradually adjusted until adequate pain relief and acceptable side effects have been achieved [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Conversion from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to Extended-Release Hydromorphone Hydrochloride The relative bioavailability of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets compared to extended-release hydromorphone hydrochloride is unknown, so conversion to extended-release tablets must be accompanied by close observation for signs of excessive sedation and respiratory depression. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. For chronic pain, doses should be administered around-the-clock. A supplemental dose of 5 to 15% of the total daily usage may be administered every two hours on an as-needed basis. 2.6 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablet Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid dependent patient taking Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.7 ) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.8 ) Severe Hypotension: Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.9 ) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. Given the inexactitude of the household spoon measure and the possibility of using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon, which could lead to over dosage, the enclosed measuring device should be used or a calibrated measuring device obtained from the pharmacist. Healthcare providers should recommend a calibrated device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and instruct caregivers to use extreme caution in measuring the dosage. 5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, and monitor all patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.3 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG. Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com. The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint. 5.4 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Overestimating the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . 5.6 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. 5.7 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets - treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.9 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.12 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets therapy. 5.13Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )]. Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.14 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and know how they will react to the medication. 5.15 Sulfites Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sulfite-containing medications.."

Serious adverse reactions associated with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Less Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations Eye disorders: vision blurred, diplopia, miosis, visual impairment Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, ileus, diarrhea, abdominal pain General disorders and administration site conditions: weakness, feeling abnormal , chills Hepatobiliary disorders: biliary colic Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle rigidity Nervous system disorders: headache, tremor, paraesthesia, nystagmus, increased intracranial pressure, syncope, taste alteration , involuntary muscle contractions, presyncope Psychiatric disorders: agitation, mood altered, nervousness, anxiety , depression, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia, abnormal dreams Renal and urinary disorders : urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: bronchospasm, laryngospasm Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria, rash, hyperhidrosis Vascular disorders: flushing, hypotension, hypertension 6.2 Post marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of hydromorphone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Confusional state, convulsions, drowsiness, dyskinesia, dyspnea, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, hepatic enzymes increased, hyperalgesia, hypersensitivity reaction, lethargy, myoclonus, oropharyngeal swelling, peripheral edema, and somnolence. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] ."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone),monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine, Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. (7) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. (7) Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets because they may reduce analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. There are no available data with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in Cmax and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. There are no available data with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain hydromorphone, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, morphine, oxymorphone and tapentadol. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are for oral use only. Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence is a physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after a period of regular exposure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )]. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent opioid agonist. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.5 )] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.5 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (Cmax and AUC0-24) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets 8 mg TABLET and an equivalent dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets has been demonstrated. After oral administration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1 hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T \u00bd(hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered Cmax by 25%, prolonged Tmax by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8-19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (Cmax and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in Cmax and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 - 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent opioid agonist. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.5 )] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.5 )]."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (Cmax and AUC0-24) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets 8 mg TABLET and an equivalent dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets has been demonstrated. After oral administration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1 hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T \u00bd(hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered Cmax by 25%, prolonged Tmax by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8-19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (Cmax and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in Cmax and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 - 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.1 ) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) Initial Dosage: Intramuscular or Subcutaneous Use : The usual starting dose is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary. ( 2.2 ) Intravenous Use : The usual starting dose is 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. The injection should be given slowly , over at least 2 to 3 minutes. ( 2.2 ) Hepatic Impairment: Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of hepatic impairment. ( 2.3 ) Renal Impairment: Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of renal impairment. ( 2.4 ) Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in a physically-dependent patient. ( 2.6 , 5.12 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. A slight yellowish discoloration may develop in hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. No loss of potency has been demonstrated. Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is physically compatible and chemically stable for at least 24 hours at 25\u00b0C, protected from light in most common large-volume parenteral solutions. Discard any unused portion in an appropriate manner. 2.2 Initial Dosage Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection as the First Opioid Analgesic: Subcutaneous or Intramuscular Administration: The usual starting dose is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary for pain, and the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Depending on the clinical situation, the initial starting dose may be lowered in patients who are opioid na\u00efve. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. Intravenous Administration: The initial starting dose is 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. Intravenous administration should be given slowly, over at least 2 to 3 minutes, depending on the dose. The initial dose should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated and may be lowered to 0.2 mg. Conversion From Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection: There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride injection dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride injection dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. If the decision is made to convert to hydromorphone hydrochloride injection from another opioid analgesic using publicly available data, convert the current total daily amount(s) of opioid(s) received to an equivalent total daily dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection and reduce by one-half due to the possibility of incomplete cross tolerance. Divide the new total amount by the number of doses permitted based on dosing interval (e.g., 8 doses for every- three-hour dosing). Titrate the dose according to the patient's response. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Start patients with hepatic impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride injection starting dose depending on the extent of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride injection starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. Individually titrate hydromorphone hydrochloride injection to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride injection to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.12) ] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride injection dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.6 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection When a patient who has been taking hydromorphone hydrochloride injection regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride injection, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in a physically-dependent patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic, or opioid rotation. ( 5.5 ) Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.6 ) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.7 ) Severe Hypotension: Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.8 ) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors , Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection contains hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride injection exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride injection and monitor all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride injection for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride injection but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage (10) ] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is essential [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride injection dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.5 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3) ]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ]. 5.6 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating hydromorphone hydrochloride injection and when hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 ), Drug Interactions (7) ]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.7 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.8 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. In patients with circulatory shock, hydromorphone hydrochloride injection may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in patients with circulatory shock. 5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), hydromorphone hydrochloride injection may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.10 Risk of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride injection may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.11 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride injection may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydromorphone hydrochloride injection therapy. 5.12 Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in these patients [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]. 5.13 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection and know how they will react to the medication. 5.15 Increased Risk of Hypotension and Respiratory Depression with Rapid Intravenous Administration Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection may be given intravenously, but the injection should be given very slowly. Rapid intravenous injection of opioid analgesics increases the possibility of side effects such as hypotension and respiratory depression [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]."

Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serious adverse reactions associated with hydromorphone hydrochloride injection include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. TABLE 1 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System Depressants (CNS) Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. [see Warni ngs and Precautions (5.3) ] Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Monitor patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection and/or precipitate withdrawal syndrome. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) : Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with hydromorphone hydrochloride injection because they may reduce analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . There are no available data with hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes. There are adverse outcomes reported with fetal exposure to opioid analgesics (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased body weight were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [ see Data ]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride injection, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for hydromorphone hydrochloride injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from hydromorphone hydrochloride injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride injection through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in pediatric patients has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by renal impairment. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection contains hydromorphone, which is a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection contains hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in combination with other abused drugs. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection should not be abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . If hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur, typically characterized by restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis, rather than miosis, may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent airway and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride injection, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct effect on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope, manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists . The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8 to 19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume of distribution [mean (%CV)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone following an oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets) are affected by renal impairment. Mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC0-\u221e) is increased by 2-fold in patients with moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) renal impairment and increased by 4-fold in patients with severe (CLcr< 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr> 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have a higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct effect on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope, manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists . The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, an opioid agonist, and are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, misuse, overdose, and death, which can occur at any dosage or duration and persist over the course of therapy, reserve opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain. ( 1 , 5.2 ) Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, misuse, overdose, and death, which can occur at any dosage or duration and persist over the course of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] , reserve opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.1 ) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) Discuss opioid overdose reversal agents and options for acquiring them with the patient and/or caregiver, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride, especially if the patient has additional risk factors for overdose, or close contacts at risk for exposure and overdose. ( 2.2 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a dosing range of 2.5 mL to 10 mL, 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. ( 2 , 5 ) Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. ( 2 , 5 ) Periodically reassess patients receiving hydromorphone to evaluate the continued need for opioid analgesics to maintain pain control, for the signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse. ( 2.6 ) Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride in a physically-dependent patient because rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. ( 2.7 , 5.14 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between mg and mL, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed. When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume. Instruct patients and caregivers on how to accurately measure and take or administer the correct dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Strongly advise patients and caregivers to always use a graduated oral syringe or measuring cup, with metric units of measurements (i.e., mL), to correctly measure the prescribed amount of medication. Inform patients and caregivers that oral dosing devices may be obtained from their pharmacy and to never use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (2.1 , 5) ]. Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a dosing range of 2.5 mL to 10 mL, 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2) Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . 2.2 Patient Access to an Opioid Overdose Reversal Agent for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Inform patients and caregivers about opioid overdose reversal agents (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene). Discuss the importance of having access to an opioid overdose reversal agent, especially if the patient has risk factors for overdose (e.g., concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose) or if there are household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the management of pain in any patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4) ] . Discuss the options for obtaining an opioid overdose reversal agent (e.g., prescription, over-the-counter, or as part of a community-based program) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There are important differences among the opioid overdose reversal agents, such as route of administration, product strength, approved patient age range, and pharmacokinetics. Be familiar with these differences, as outlined in the approved labeling for those products, prior to recommending or prescribing such an agent. 2.3 Initial Dosage Initiating Treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a dosing range of 2.5 mL to 10 mL, 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. In general, it is safest to start hydromorphone hydrochloride therapy by administering half of the usual starting dose every 3 to 6 hours for hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution; and every 4 to 6 hours for hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. The dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride can be gradually adjusted until adequate pain relief and acceptable side effects have been achieved [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Conversion from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to Extended-Release Hydromorphone Hydrochloride The relative bioavailability of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets compared to extended-release hydromorphone is unknown, so conversion to extended-release hydromorphone may lead to increased risk of excessive sedation and respiratory depression. 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.5 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.6 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.14) ] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. A supplemental dose of 5 to 15% of the total daily usage may be administered every two hours on an as-needed basis. 2.7 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid dependent patient taking hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation. ( 5.7 ) Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Regularly evaluate patients, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.8 ) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.9 ) Severe Hypotension: Regularly evaluate patients during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.10 ) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor patients for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. Avoid dosing errors that may result from confusion between mg and mL and confusion with other hydromorphone oral solutions of different concentrations, when prescribing, dispensing, and administering hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. Instruct patients and caregivers on how to measure and take or administer the correct dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and to use extreme caution when measuring the dose. Strongly advise patients and caregivers to obtain and always use a graduated device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and to never use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure a dose because these are not accurate measuring devices. 5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. The risk of opioid-related overdose or overdose-related death is increased with higher opioid doses, and this risk persists over the course of therapy. In postmarketing studies, addiction, abuse, misuse, and fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose were observed in patients with long-term opioid use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, and reassess all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider recommending or prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and the proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid overdose reversal agents (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10) ] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Patient Access to an Opioid Overdose Reversal Agent for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Inform patients and caregivers about opioid overdose reversal agents (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene). Discuss the importance of having access to an opioid overdose reversal agent, especially if the patient has risk factors for overdose (e.g., concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose) or if there are household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the management of pain in any patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.4) ] . Discuss the options for obtaining an opioid overdose reversal agent (e.g., prescription, over-the-counter, or as part of a community-based program). There are important differences among the opioid overdose reversal agents, such as route of administration, product strength, approved patient age range, and pharmacokinetics. Be familiar with these differences, as outlined in the approved labeling for those products, prior to recommending or prescribing such an agent. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression, and how to use an opioid overdose reversal agent for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose. Emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if an opioid overdose reversal agent is administered [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.4) , Overdosage (10) ]. 5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids [gabapentin or pregabalin], and other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate then on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider recommending or prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Overdosage (10) ]. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.6 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG . Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com . The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint . 5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3) ]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . 5.8 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution- or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and when hydromorphone hydrochloride is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4) , Drug Interactions (7) ] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.9 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.10 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, hydromorphone hydrochloride may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.12 Risks of Gastrointestinal Complications Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Cases of opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED) have been reported in patients taking opioids. The risk of OIED may increase as the dose and/or duration of opioids increases. Regularly evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of OIED (e.g., dysphagia, regurgitation, non-cardiac chest pain) and, if necessary, adjust opioid therapy as clinically appropriate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 5.13 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets therapy. 5.14 Withdrawal Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]. Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and know how they will react to the medication. 5.16 Sulfites Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sulfite-containing medications."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Interactions with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Severe Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] Most common adverse reactions are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rhodes Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-827-0616 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Serious adverse reactions associated with hydromorphone hydrochloride include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Less Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations Eye disorders: vision blurred, diplopia, miosis, visual impairment Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, ileus, diarrhea, abdominal pain General disorders and administration site conditions: weakness, feeling abnormal , chills Hepatobiliary disorders: biliary colic Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle rigidity Nervous system disorders: headache, tremor, paraesthesia, nystagmus, increased intracranial pressure, syncope, taste alteration , involuntary muscle contractions, presyncope Psychiatric disorders: agitation, mood altered, nervousness, anxiety , depression, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia, abnormal dreams Renal and urinary disorders : urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: bronchospasm, laryngospasm Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria, rash, hyperhidrosis Vascular disorders: flushing, hypotension, hypertension 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of hydromorphone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Confusional state, convulsions, drowsiness, dyskinesia, dyspnea, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, hepatic enzymes increased, hyperalgesia, hypersensitivity reaction, lethargy, myoclonus, oropharyngeal swelling, peripheral edema, and somnolence. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Hypoglycemia: Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor (e.g., diabetes). Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED) : Cases of OIED have been reported in patients taking opioids and may occur more frequently in patients taking higher doses of opioids, and/or in patients taking opioids longer term [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Adverse Reactions from Observational Studies A prospective, observational cohort study estimated the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse in patients initiating long-term use of Schedule II opioid analgesics between 2017 and 2021. Study participants included in one or more analyses had been enrolled in selected insurance plans or health systems for at least one year, were free of at least one outcome at baseline, completed a minimum number of follow-up assessments, and either: 1) filled multiple extended-release/long-acting opioid analgesic prescriptions during a 90-day period (n=978); or 2) filled any Schedule II opioid analgesic prescriptions covering at least 70 of 90 days (n=1,244). Those included also had no dispensing of the qualifying opioids in the previous 6 months. Over 12 months: approximately 1% to 6% of participants across the two cohorts newly met criteria for addiction, as assessed with two validated interview-based measures of moderate-to-severe opioid use disorder based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria, and approximately 9% and 22% of participants across the two cohorts newly met criteria for prescription opioid abuse and misuse [defined in Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)] , respectively, as measured with a validated self-reported instrument. A retrospective, observational cohort study estimated the risk of opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death in patients with new long-term use of Schedule II opioid analgesics from 2006 through 2016 (n=220,249). Included patients had been enrolled in either one of two commercial insurance programs, one managed care program, or one Medicaid program for at least 9 months. New long-term use was defined as having Schedule II opioid analgesic prescriptions covering at least 70 days' supply over the 3 months prior to study entry and none during the preceding 6 months. Patients were excluded if they had an opioid-involved overdose in the 9 months prior to study entry. Overdose was measured using a validated medical code-based algorithm with linkage to the National Death Index database. The 5-year cumulative incidence estimates for opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death ranged from approximately 1.5% to 4% across study sites, counting only the first event during follow-up. Approximately 17% of first opioid overdoses observed over the entire study period (5 to 11 years, depending on the study site) were fatal. Higher baseline opioid dose was the strongest and most consistent predictor of opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death. Study exclusion criteria may have selected patients at lower risk of overdose, and substantial loss to follow-up (approximately 80%) also may have biased estimates. The risk estimates from the studies described above may not be generalizable to all patients receiving opioid analgesics, such as those with exposures shorter or longer than the duration evaluated in the studies."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with hydromorphone hydrochloride. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with HYDROMORPHONE HYDROCHLORIDE Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider recommending or prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4) ] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids (gabapentin or pregabalin), other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: Phenelzine, tranylcypromine, and linezolid. Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: Butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, and buprenorphine. Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of skeletal muscle relaxants and opioids, consider recommending or prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4) ]. Examples: cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) : Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with hydromorphone hydrochloride because they may reduce analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. There are no available data with hydromorphone hydrochloride in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data ]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid overdose reversal agent, such as naloxone or nalmefene, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws, and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of hydromorphone hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and regularly evaluated during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be regularly evaluated during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. There are no available data with hydromorphone hydrochloride in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data ]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid overdose reversal agent, such as naloxone or nalmefene, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws, and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of hydromorphone hydrochloride abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use hydromorphone hydrochloride in combination with other abused drugs. \"Drug-seeking\" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \"loss\" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \"Doctor shopping\" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone hydrochloride, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of hydromorphone hydrochloride with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are approved for oral use only. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Toxic leukoencephalopathy has been reported after opioid overdose and can present hours, days, or weeks after apparent recovery from the initial intoxication. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid overdose reversal agent such as naloxone or nalmefene. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid overdose reversal agent is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional reversal agent as directed by the product's prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the opioid overdose reversal agent will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the reversal agent administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the reversal agent should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the reversal agent."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, transient elevations in serum amylase, and opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED). Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.6) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.3 , 2.6) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of hydromorphone hydrochloride is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-24 ) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the hydromorphone hydrochloride 8 mg tablet and an equivalent dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution has been demonstrated. After oral administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1 hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T \u00bd (hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) 8 mg Oral Liquid 5.7 (31%) 0.73 (71%) 24.6 (29%) 2.8 (20%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered C max by 25%, prolonged T max by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8 to 19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.6) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.3 , 2.6) ] ."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of hydromorphone hydrochloride is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-24 ) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the hydromorphone hydrochloride 8 mg tablet and an equivalent dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution has been demonstrated. After oral administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1 hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T \u00bd (hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) 8 mg Oral Liquid 5.7 (31%) 0.73 (71%) 24.6 (29%) 2.8 (20%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered C max by 25%, prolonged T max by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8 to 19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is indicated for use in opioid-tolerant patients who require higher doses of opioids for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternate treatments are inadequate. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking for one week or longer, around-the-clock medicine consisting of at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, or at least 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, or at least 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, or at least 8 g oral hydromorphone per day, or at least 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or at least 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. Patients must remain on around-the-clock opioids while administering Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is an opioid agonist indicated for use in opioid-tolerant patients who require higher doses of opioids for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternate treatments are inadequate. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking, for one week or longer, around-the-clock medicine consisting of at least 60 mg of oral morphine per day, at least 25 mcg/hr of transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone per day, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per day, at least 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, at least 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid daily for a week or longer. Patients must remain on around-the-clock opioids when administering Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Limitations of Use: ( 1 ) Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration ( 5.2 ), reserve Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products): \u2022 Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, \u2022 Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate. Limitations of Use: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] , reserve Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products): \u2022 Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, \u2022 Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) \u2022 Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) \u2022 Initial Dosage: o Intramuscular or Subcutaneous Use: The usual starting dose is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary. ( 2.2 ) o Intravenous Use: The usual starting dose is 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. The injection should be given slowly, over at least 2 to 3 minutes. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is for opioid-tolerant patients only and should be used only if the amount of hydromorphone required can be delivered accurately with this formulation. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Impairment: Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of hepatic impairment. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of renal impairment. ( 2.4 ) \u2022 Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in a physically-dependent patient. ( 2.6 , 5.13 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. \u2022 Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. \u2022 There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . \u2022 Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . \u2022 Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. A slight yellowish discoloration may develop in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] vials. No loss of potency has been demonstrated. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is physically compatible and chemically stable for at least 24 hours at 25\u00b0C, protected from light in most common large-volume parenteral solutions. \u2022 Discard any unused portion in an appropriate manner. 500 mg/50 mL Vial To use this single-dose presentation, withdraw the contents using aseptic technique for preparation of a single, large-volume parenteral solution. Discard any unused portion in an appropriate manner. 2.2 Initial Dosage Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] as the First Opioid Analgesic: Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is for use in opioid tolerant patients only. Do not use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant or sedating effects of opioids. Subcutaneous or Intramuscular Administration: The usual starting dose is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary for pain, and the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Depending on the clinical situation, the initial starting dose may be lowered in patients who are opioid na\u00efve. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Intravenous Administration: The initial starting dose is 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. Intravenous administration should be given slowly , over at least 2 to 3 minutes, depending on the dose. The initial dose should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated and may be lowered to 0.2 mg. Conversion From Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]: There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. If the decision is made to convert to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] from another opioid analgesic using publicly available data, convert the current total daily amount(s) of opioid(s) received to an equivalent total daily dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] and reduce by one-half due to the possibility of incomplete cross tolerance. Divide the new total amount by the number of doses permitted based on dosing interval (e.g., 8 doses for every-three-hour dosing). Titrate the dose according to the patient's response. Use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] ONLY for patients who require the higher concentration and lower total volume of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Because of its high concentration, the delivery of precise doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may be difficult if low doses of hydromorphone are required. Therefore, use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] only if the amount of hydromorphone required can be delivered accurately with this formulation. Base the starting dose for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] on the prior dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or on the prior dose of an alternate opioid. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients With Hepatic Impairment Start patients with hepatic impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection starting dose depending on the extent of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients With Renal Impairment Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Individually titrate Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.13) ] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.6 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] When a patient who has been taking Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] regularly and may be physically-dependent no longer requires therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in a physically-dependent patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia : Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic, or opioid rotation. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients With Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Severe Hypotension: Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Risks of Use in Patients With Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Risk of Medication Errors Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is a 10 mg/mL concentrated solution of hydromorphone, and is intended for use in opioid-tolerant patients only. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg oral morphine/day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl/hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone/day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone/day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone/day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. Do not confuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] with standard parenteral formulations of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, as overdose and death could result. 5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ] . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], and monitor all patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10) ] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Overestimating the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is for use in opioid-tolerant patients only. Administration of this formulation may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.6 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3) ] . Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] . 5.7 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients With Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients With Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] and when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4), Drug Interactions (7) ] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.9 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. In patients with circulatory shock, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in patients with circulatory shock. 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients With Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients With Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.12 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients With Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] therapy. 5.13 Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . When discontinuing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in these patients [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] . 5.14 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] and know how they will react to the medication. 5.15 Increased Risk of Hypotension and Respiratory Depression With Rapid Intravenous Administration Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may be given intravenously, but the injection should be given very slowly. Rapid intravenous injection of opioid analgesics increases the possibility of side effects such as hypotension and respiratory depression [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] ."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Table 1. Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System Depressants (CNS) Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Intervention : Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Monitor patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact : MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] and/or precipitate withdrawal syndrome. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. \u2022 Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) \u2022 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) \u2022 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] because they may reduce analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . There are no available data with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes. There are adverse outcomes reported with fetal exposure to opioid analgesics (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased body weight were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data ] . Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in pediatric patients has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by renal impairment. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . There are no available data with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes. There are adverse outcomes reported with fetal exposure to opioid analgesics (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased body weight were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data ] . Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively).

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] contains hydromorphone, which is a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] contains hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in combination with other abused drugs. \"Drug-seeking\" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \"loss\" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \"Doctor shopping\" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] should not be abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . If Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur, typically characterized by restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically-dependent on opioids will also be physically-dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis, rather than miosis, may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent airway and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information. In an individual physically-dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically-dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct effect on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope, manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8\u201319% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume of distribution [mean (%CV)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone following an oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets) are affected by renal impairment. Mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0\u2013\u221e ) is increased by 2-fold in patients with moderate (CLcr = 40 \u2212 60 mL/min) renal impairment and increased by 4-fold in patients with severe (CLcr< 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr> 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have a higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0\u201324 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope, manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) ] ."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8\u201319% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume of distribution [mean (%CV)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone following an oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets) are affected by renal impairment. Mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0\u2013\u221e ) is increased by 2-fold in patients with moderate (CLcr = 40 \u2212 60 mL/min) renal impairment and increased by 4-fold in patients with severe (CLcr< 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr> 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have a higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0\u201324 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.1 ) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient\u2019s need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose. ( 2.2 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. ( 2 , 5 ) Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a physically-dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. ( 2.7 , 5.14 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions ( 2.1 , 5 )]. Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. 2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 )] . Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. 2.3 Initial Dosage Initiating Treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. In general, it is safest to start hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets therapy by administering half of the usual starting dose every 4 to 6 hours for hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. The dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets can be gradually adjusted until adequate pain relief and acceptable side effects have been achieved [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Conversion from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to Extended-Release Hydromorphone Hydrochloride The relative bioavailability of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets compared to extended-release hydromorphone is unknown, so conversion to extended-release hydromorphone may lead to increased risk of excessive sedation and respiratory depression. 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.5 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.6 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.14 )] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. A supplemental dose of 5 to 15% of the total daily usage may be administered every two hours on an as-needed basis. 2.7 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid dependent patient taking hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation. ( 5.7 ) Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Regularly evaluate patients, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.8 ) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.9 ) Severe Hypotension: Regularly evaluate patients during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.10 ) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor patients for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death Due to Medication Errors Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. 5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )] . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, and reassess all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and the proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] . Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered. Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.4 ), Overdosage ( 10 )] . 5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate then on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Overdosage ( 10 )] . Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.6 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG . Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com . The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint . 5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence ( 9.3 )]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . 5.8 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease : Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablet-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Regularly evaluate such patients, particularly when initiating and titrating hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and when hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.9 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.10 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.12 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.13 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets therapy. 5.14 Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] . Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and know how they will react to the medication. 5.16 Sulfites Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sulfite-containing medications."

Serious adverse reactions associated with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Less Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations Eye disorders: vision blurred, diplopia, miosis, visual impairment Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, ileus, diarrhea, abdominal pain General disorders and administration site conditions: weakness, feeling abnormal, chills Hepatobiliary disorders: biliary colic Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle rigidity Nervous system disorders: headache, tremor, paraesthesia, nystagmus, increased intracranial pressure, syncope, taste alteration, involuntary muscle contractions, presyncope Psychiatric disorders: agitation, mood altered, nervousness, anxiety, depression, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia, abnormal dreams Renal and urinary disorders: urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: bronchospasm, laryngospasm Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria, rash, hyperhidrosis Vascular disorders: flushing, hypotension, hypertension 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of hydromorphone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Confusional state, convulsions, drowsiness, dyskinesia, dyspnea, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, hepatic enzymes increased, hyperalgesia, hypersensitivity reaction, lethargy, myoclonus, oropharyngeal swelling, peripheral edema, and somnolence. Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Hyperalgesia and Allodynia : Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Hypoglycemia : Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor (e.g., diabetes)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 )] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: Phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid. Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: Butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine. Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.4 )]. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. If serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) : Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets because they may reduce analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . There are no available data with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data] . Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or non-medical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high-pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and regularly evaluated during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be regularly evaluated during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in combination with other abused drugs. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are approved for oral use only. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] ."

Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration-Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.6 )] . Concentration-Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.3 , 2.6 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-24 ) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). After oral administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within &frac12; to 1 hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T &frac12; (hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered C max by 25%, prolonged T max by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8 to 19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC \u221e ) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression, including information that the risk is greatest when starting hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets or when the dosage is increased, and that it can occur even at recommended dosages. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Accidental Ingestion Inform patients that accidental ingestion, especially by children, may result in respiratory depression or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Interactions with Benzodiazepines and Other CNS Depressants Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, and not to use these concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss with the patient and caregiver the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose. Explain to patients and caregivers that naloxone\u2019s effects are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers: How to treat with naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose To tell family and friends about their naloxone and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency To read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their naloxone. Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do. Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Inform patients and caregivers not to increase opioid dosage without first consulting a clinician. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of hyperalgesia, including worsening pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Serotonin Syndrome Inform patients that hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition called serotonin syndrome resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], reserve Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]: Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated, Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain hydromorphone, an opioid agonist, and are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses, reserve Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]: Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated, Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia"
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Individualize dosing based on the severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. (2.1) Usual adult starting dose for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours. (2.2) Hepatic Impairment : Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of hepatic impairment. (2.3) Renal Impairment : Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of renal impairment. (2.4) Do not stop Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets abruptly in a physically-dependent patient. (2.5) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 2.2 Initial Dosage Initiating Treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Initiate treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. In general, it is safest to start Hydromorphone Hydrochloride therapy by administering half of the usual starting dose every 4-6 hours for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. The dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride can be gradually adjusted until adequate pain relief and acceptable side effects have been achieved [See Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Conversion from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to Extended-Release Hydromorphone Hydrochloride The relative bioavailability of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets compared to extended-release Hydromorphone Hydrochloride is unknown, so conversion to extended-release tablets must be accompanied by close observation for signs of excessive sedation and respiratory depression. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. For chronic pain, doses should be administered around-the-clock. A supplemental dose of 5-15% of the total daily usage may be administered every two hours on an as-needed basis. 2.6 Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets When a patient who has been taking Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs and symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a physically dependent patient. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Diseaseor in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. (5.6) Adrenal Insufficiency :If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. (5.7) Severe Hypotension : Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with circulatory shock. (5.8) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. (5.9) 5.1 Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. Given the inexactitude of the household spoon measure and the possibility of using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon, which could lead to overdosage, the enclosed measuring device should be used or a calibrated measuring device obtained from the pharmacist. Health care providers should recommend a calibrated device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and instruct caregivers to use extreme caution in measuring the dosage. 5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, and monitor all patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.5 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)]. If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17)] 5.6 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease : Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablet- treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.7 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.8 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.11 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets therapy. 5.12 Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7)]. When discontinuing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in these patients. [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. 5.13 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and know how they will react to the medication. 5.14 Sulfites Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sulfite-containing medications."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.X)]. Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine, Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs : Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. if serotonin syndrome is suspected. (7) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) : Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. (7) MixedAgonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics : Avoid use with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride because they may reduce analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. (8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. There are no available data with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day Hydromorphone Hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one- half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain hydromorphone, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, morphine, oxymorphone and tapentadol. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are for oral use only. Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets should not be abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. If Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur. Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome: restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5)]. Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.5)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride (Hydromorphone Hydrochloride) is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-24 ) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride 8 mg TABLET and an equivalent dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution has been demonstrated. After oral administration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1-hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T \u00bd (hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) 8 mg Oral Liquid 5.7 (31%) 0.73 (71%) 24.6 (29%) 2.8 (20%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered C max by 25%, prolonged T max by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8-19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half- life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6- hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC \u221e ) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in Cmax and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 - 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in Cmax may not be clinically relevant."

Limitations of Use : Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 ) ] , reserve hydromorphone hydrochloride injection for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]: Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternate treatments are inadequate. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use : Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, reserve hydromorphone hydrochloride injection for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]: Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.1 ) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) I nitia l Dosage: - Intramuscular or Subcutaneous Use : The usual starting dose is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary. ( 2.2 ) - Intravenous Use : The usual starting dose is 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. The injection should be given slowly , over at least 2 to 3 minutes. ( 2.2 ) Hepatic Impairment : Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of hepatic impairment. ( 2.3 ) Renal Impairment: Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of renal impairment. ( 2.4 ) Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in a physically dependent patient. ( 2.6 , 5.12 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5) ]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] . Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. A slight yellowish discoloration may develop in hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. No loss of potency has been demonstrated. Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is physically compatible and chemically stable for at least 24 hours at 25\u00b0C, protected from light in most common large-volume parenteral solutions. Discard any unused portion in an appropriate manner. 2.2 Initial Dosage Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection as the First Opioid Analgesic : Subcutaneous or Intramuscular Administration: The usual starting dose is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary for pain. Depending on the clinical situation, the initial starting dose may be lowered in patients who are opioid na\u00efve. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Intravenous Administration: The initial starting dose is 0.2 to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. Intravenous administration should be given slowly , over at least 2 to 3 minutes, depending on the dose. The initial dose should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated and may be lowered to 0.2 mg. C on v ersion From Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection : There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride injection dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride injection dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. If the decision is made to convert to hydromorphone hydrochloride injection from another opioid analgesic using publicly available data, convert the current total daily amount(s) of opioid(s) received to an equivalent total daily dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection and reduce by one-half due to the possibility of incomplete cross tolerance. Divide the new total amount by the number of doses permitted based on dosing interval (e.g., 8 doses for every-three-hour dosing). Titrate the dose according to the patient's response. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Start patients with hepatic impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride injection starting dose depending on the extent of impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ] . 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride injection starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Titrate the dose based on individual patient\u2019s response to their final dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. Individually titrate Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride injection to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1. (5.12)) ] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride injection dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.6 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection When a patient who has been taking hydromorphone hydrochloride injection regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride injection, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in a physically-dependent patient [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.12) , DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9.3) ]."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic, or opioid rotation. ( 5.5 ) Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.6 ) Adrenal Insufficiency : If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.7 ) Severe Hypotension : Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.8 ) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.9 ) 5.1. Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection contains hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride injection exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9) ]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride injection, and monitor all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride injection for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride injection, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity. Contact local state professional licensing board or state- controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see OVERDOSAGE (10) ] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is essential [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2) ]. Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride injection dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep- related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7) ] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1) ,] . 5.5 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3) ]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ]. 5.6 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease : Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) ] . Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) ]. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating hydromorphone hydrochloride injection and when hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) ]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.7 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.8 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7) ] . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. In patients with circulatory shock, hydromorphone hydrochloride injection may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in patients with circulatory shock. 5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), hydromorphone hydrochloride injection may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride injection may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.11 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride injection may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydromorphone hydrochloride injection therapy. 5.12 Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7) ]. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride injection, in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.6) ]. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in these patients [see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9.3) ]. 5.13 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone hydrochloride may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection and know how they will react to the medication. 5.15 Increased Risk of Hypotension and Respiratory Depression with Rapid Intravenous Administration Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection may be given intravenously, but the injection should be given very slowly. Rapid intravenous injection of opioid analgesics increases the possibility of side effects such as hypotension and respiratory depression [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2) ]."

Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serious adverse reactions associated with hydromorphone hydrochloride injection include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Less Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations Eye disorders: vision blurred, diplopia, miosis, visual impairment Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, ileus, diarrhea, abdominal pain General disorders and administration site conditions: weakness, feeling abnormal , chills, injection site urticaria, fatigue, injection site reactions, peripheral edema Hepatobiliary disorders: biliary colic Immune system disorders: anaphylactic reactions, hypersensitivity reactions Investigations: hepatic enzymes increased Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle rigidity Nervous system disorders: headache, tremor, paraesthesia, nystagmus, increased intracranial pressure, syncope, taste alteration , involuntary muscle contractions, presyncope, convulsion, drowsiness, dyskinesia, hyperalgesia, lethargy, myoclonus, somnolence Psychiatric disorders: agitation, mood altered, nervousness, anxiety , depression, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia, abnormal dreams Renal and urinary disorders: urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects Reproductive system and breast disorders: erectile dysfunction Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: bronchospasm, laryngospasm, dyspnea, oropharyngeal swelling Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: injection site pain, urticaria, rash, hyperhidrosis Vascular disorders: flushing, hypotension, hypertension Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with hydromorphone hydrochloride injection. TABLE 1 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection B enzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System Depressants (CNS) C linical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3) ] . In tervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3) ] . E xamples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs C linical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. In tervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. E xamples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). M o noamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) C linical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) ] . If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. In tervention: The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. E xamples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid M ixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics C linical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection and/or precipitate withdrawal syndrome. In tervention: Avoid concomitant use. E xamples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine M uscle Relaxants C linical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. In tervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Diuretics C linical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. In tervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs C linical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. In tervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs : Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) M o n o a m in e Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) : Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics : Avoid use with hydromorphone hydrochloride injection because they may reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ]. There are no available data with hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes. There are adverse outcomes reported with fetal exposure to opioid analgesics (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased body weight were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [ see Data ]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ]. Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride injection, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for hydromorphone hydrochloride injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from hydromorphone hydrochloride injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride injection through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6) , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) , NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection in pediatric patients has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6) ]. Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by renal impairment. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]."

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection contains hydromorphone, which is a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection contains hydromorphone, a substance with a high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction. [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) ]. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse or those who use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in combination with other abused drugs. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of hydromorphone hydrochloride injection with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection should not be abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.6) ] . If hydromorphone hydrochloride injection is abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur, typically characterized by restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone hydrochloride injection can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis, rather than miosis, may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) ] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent airway and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride injection, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct effect on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled in studies conducted to date [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids . The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1 , 2.2) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1, 2.2) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8-19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume of distribution [mean (%CV)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC \u221e ) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone following an oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets) are affected by renal impairment. Mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-\u221e ) is increased by 2-fold in patients with moderate (CLcr = 40 - 60 mL/min) renal impairment and increased by 4-fold in patients with severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7) ]. Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have a higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are indicated in opioid-tolerant patients for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an opioid analgesic and that cannot be adequately treated with alternative options, including immediate-release opioids. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Limitations of Use \u2022 Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, misuse, overdose, and death, which can occur at any dosage or duration and persist over the course of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] , reserve opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain. \u2022 Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are an opioid agonist indicated in opioid-tolerant patients for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an opioid analgesic and that cannot be adequately treated with alternative options, including immediate-release opioids. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) \u2022 Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) \u2022 For once daily administration IN OPIOID-TOLERANT PATIENTS. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Instruct patients to swallow hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets intact, and not to cut, break, chew, crush, or dissolve the tablets (risk of potentially fatal overdose). ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Discuss opioid overdose reversal agents and options for acquiring them with the patient and/or caregiver, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially if the patient has additional risk factors for overdose, or close contacts at risk for exposure and overdose. ( 2.2 , 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 ) \u2022 Dose may be increased using increments of 4 to 8 mg every 3 to 4 days as needed to achieve adequate analgesia. ( 2.4 ) \u2022 Periodically reassess patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to evaluate the continued need for opioid analgesics to maintain pain control, for the signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse. ( 2.4 ) \u2022 Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a physically-dependent patient because rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. ( 2.5 , 5.13 ) \u2022 Moderate Hepatic Impairment : Initiate treatment with 25% of the dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal hepatic function. Monitor closely for respiratory and central nervous system depression. ( 2.6 ) \u2022 Moderate and Severe Renal Impairment : Initiate treatment in patients with moderate renal impairment with 50% and patients with severe renal impairment with 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal renal function. Monitor closely for respiratory and central nervous system depression. ( 2.7 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions \u2022 To avoid medication errors, prescribers and pharmacists must be aware that hydromorphone is available as both immediate-release 8 mg tablets and extended-release 8 mg tablets. \u2022 Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. \u2022 Due to the risk of respiratory depression, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only indicated for use in patients who are already opioid-tolerant. Discontinue or taper all other extended-release opioids when beginning hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only for use in opioid-tolerant patients, do not begin any patient on hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets as the first opioid. \u2022 Patients who are opioid-tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg of oral morphine per day, at least 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone per day, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per day, at least 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, at least 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. \u2022 Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . \u2022 Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . \u2022 Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are administered orally once daily IN OPIOID-TOLERANT PATIENTS. \u2022 Instruct patients to swallow hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets whole [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . Crushing, chewing, or dissolving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of hydromorphone and can lead to overdose or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 2.2 Patient Access to an Opioid Overdose Reversal Agent for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Inform patients and caregivers about opioid overdose reversal agents (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene). Discuss the importance of having access to an opioid overdose reversal agent, especially if the patient has risk factors for overdose (e.g., concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose) or if there are household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the management of pain in any patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 )]. Discuss the options for obtaining an opioid overdose reversal agent (e.g., prescription, over-the-counter, or as part of a community-based program) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . There are important differences among the opioid overdose reversal agents, such as route of administration, product strength, approved patient age range, and pharmacokinetics. Be familiar with these differences, as outlined in the approved labeling for those products, prior to recommending or prescribing such an agent. 2.3 Initial Dosage It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour oral hydromorphone dosage and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral hydromorphone dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Frequently reevaluate patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and for signs of oversedation/toxicity after converting patients to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Conversion from Other Oral Opioid Analgesics to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets When hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy is initiated, discontinue all opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate. In a hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets clinical trial with an open-label titration period, patients were converted from their prior opioid to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets using the Table 1 as a guide for the initial hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose. The recommended starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is 50% of the calculated estimate of daily hydromorphone requirement. Calculate the estimated daily hydromorphone requirement using Table 1 . Consider the following when using the information in Table 1 : \u2022 This is not a table of equianalgesic doses. \u2022 The conversion factors in this table are only for the conversion from one of the listed oral opioid analgesics to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \u2022 The table cannot be used to convert from hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to another opioid. Doing so will result in an overestimation of the dose of the new opioid and may result in fatal overdose. Table 1. Conversion Factors to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Prior Oral Opioid Approximate Oral Conversion Factor Hydromorphone 1 Codeine 0.06 Hydrocodone 0.4 Methadone 0.6 Morphine 0.2 Oxycodone 0.4 Oxymorphone 0.6 To calculate the estimated hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose using Table 1 : \u2022 For patients on a single opioid, sum the current total daily dose of the opioid and then multiply the total daily dose by the conversion factor to calculate the approximate oral hydromorphone daily dose. \u2022 For patients on a regimen of more than one opioid, calculate the approximate oral hydromorphone dose for each opioid and sum the totals to obtain the approximate total hydromorphone daily dose. \u2022 For patients on a regimen of fixed-ratio opioid/non-opioid analgesic products, use only the opioid component of these products in the conversion. Always round the dose down, if necessary, to the appropriate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets strength(s) available. Example conversion from a single opioid to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets: Step 1: Sum the total daily dose of the opioid \u2022 30 mg of oxycodone 2 times daily = 60 mg total daily dose of oxycodone Step 2: Calculate the approximate equivalent dose of oral hydromorphone based on the total daily dose of the current opioid using Table 1 \u2022 60 mg total daily dose of oxycodone x Conversion Factor of 0.4 = 24 mg of oral hydromorphone daily Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to be given every 24 hours, which is 50% of the calculated oral hydromorphone dose. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablet strengths available. \u2022 50% of 24 mg results in an initial dose of 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily \u2022 Adjust individually for each patient Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Conversion from Methadone to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma. Conversion from Fentanyl Transdermal System to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Eighteen hours following the removal of the fentanyl transdermal system, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets treatment can be initiated. To calculate the 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose, use a conversion factor of 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal system to 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Then reduce the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose by 50%. For example: Step 1: Identify the dose of transdermal fentanyl. \u2022 75 mg of transdermal fentanyl Step 2: Use the conversion factor of 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal system to 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \u2022 75 mg of transdermal fentanyl: 36 mg total daily dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to be given every 24 hours, which is 50% of the converted dose. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablet strengths available. \u2022 50% of 36 mg results in an initial dose of 18 mg, which would be rounded down to 16 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily \u2022 Adjust individually for each patient 2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.13 )] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During use of opioid therapy for an extended period of time, periodically reassess the continued need for use of opioid analgesics. Plasma levels of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are sustained for 18 to 24 hours. Dosage adjustments of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be made in increments of 4 to 8 mg every 3 to 4 days as needed to achieve adequate analgesia. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dose increase of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.5 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] . 2.6 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Moderate Hepatic Impairment Start patients with moderate hepatic impairment on 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal hepatic function. Closely monitor patients with moderate hepatic impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. Use of alternate analgesics is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 2.7 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Start patients with moderate renal impairment on 50% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal renal function. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only intended for once daily administration, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing interval in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] ."

( 5.7 ) \u2022 Adrenal Insufficiency : If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Severe Hypotension : Regularly evaluate during dose initiation and titration. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contains hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )] . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. The risk of opioid-related overdose or overdose-related death is increased with higher opioid doses, and this risk persists over the course of therapy. In postmarketing studies, addiction, abuse, misuse, and fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose were observed in patients with long-term opioid use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, and reassess all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider recommending or prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Abuse or misuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of hydromorphone and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modified-release opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid overdose reversal agents, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Patient Access to an Opioid Overdose Reversal Agent for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Inform patients and caregivers about opioid overdose reversal agents (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene). Discuss the importance of having access to an opioid overdose reversal agent, especially if the patient has risk factors for overdose (e.g., concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose) or if there are household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the management of pain in any patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.3 )] . Discuss the options for obtaining an opioid overdose reversal agent (e.g., prescription, over-the-counter, or as part of a community-based program). There are important differences among the opioid overdose reversal agents, such as route of administration, product strength, approved patient age range, and pharmacokinetics. Be familiar with these differences, as outlined in the approved labeling for those products, prior to recommending or prescribing such an agent. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression, and how to use an opioid overdose reversal agent for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose. Emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if an opioid overdose reversal agent is administered [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.3 ), Overdosage ( 10 )] . 5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids [gabapentin or pregabalin], and other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider recommending or prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Overdosage ( 10 )] . Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . 5.5 Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: \u2022 Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. \u2022 Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG . \u2022 Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. \u2022 Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com . The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint . 5.6 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence ( 9.3 )] . Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ); Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] . 5.7 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease : Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.9 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.11 Risks of Gastrointestinal Complications Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with other GI obstruction. Because the shell of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablet is insoluble, it may remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and be eliminated in the feces. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic, for example: esophageal motility disorders, small bowel inflammatory disease, \u201cshort gut\u201d syndrome due to adhesions or decreased transit time, past history of peritonitis, cystic fibrosis, chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, or Meckel\u2019s diverticulum). There have been reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures or risk of strictures, such as previous GI surgery, in association with the ingestion of drugs in nondeformable extended-release formulations. It is possible that hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be visible on abdominal x-rays under certain circumstances, especially when digital enhancing techniques are utilized. The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Cases of opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED) have been reported in patients taking opioids. The risk of OIED may increase as the dose and/or duration of opioids increases. Regularly evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of OIED (e.g., dysphagia, regurgitation, non-cardiac chest pain) and, if necessary, adjust opioid therapy as clinically appropriate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . 5.12 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. 5.13 Withdrawal Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] . Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.14 Sulfites Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . 5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may impair the mental and/or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and know how they will react to the medication [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] ."

Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets was administered to a total of 2,524 patients in 15 controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies. Of these, 423 patients were exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for greater than 6 months and 141 exposed for greater than one year. The most common adverse reactions leading to study discontinuation were nausea, vomiting, constipation, somnolence, and dizziness. The most common treatment-related serious adverse reactions from controlled and uncontrolled chronic pain studies were drug withdrawal syndrome, overdose, confusional state, and constipation. The overall incidence of adverse reactions in patients greater than 65 years of age was higher, with a greater than 5% difference in rates for constipation and nausea when compared with younger patients. The overall incidence of adverse reactions in female patients was higher, with a greater than 5% difference in rates for nausea, vomiting, constipation and somnolence when compared with male patients. A 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study was conducted in opioid tolerant patients with moderate to severe low back pain [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . A total of 447 patients were enrolled into the open-label titration phase with 268 patients randomized into the double-blind treatment phase. The adverse reactions that were reported in at least 2% of the patients are contained in Table 2 . Table 2.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylactic reaction has been reported with ingredients contained in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )]. Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Hyperalgesia and Allodynia : Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Hypoglycemia: Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor (e.g., diabetes). Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED) : Cases of OIED have been reported in patients taking opioids, and may occur more frequently in patients taking higher doses of opioids, and/or in patients taking opioids longer term [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . Adverse Reactions from Observational Studies A prospective, observational cohort study estimated the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse in patients initiating long-term use of Schedule II opioid analgesics between 2017 and 2021. Study participants included in one or more analyses had been enrolled in selected insurance plans or health systems for at least one year, were free of at least one outcome at baseline, completed a minimum number of follow-up assessments, and either: 1) filled multiple extended-release/long-acting opioid analgesic prescriptions during a 90-day period (n=978); or 2) filled any Schedule II opioid analgesic prescriptions covering at least 70 of 90 days (n=1,244). Those included also had no dispensing of the qualifying opioids in the previous 6 months. Over 12 months: \u2022 approximately 1% to 6% of participants across the two cohorts newly met criteria for addiction, as assessed with two validated interview-based measures of moderate-to-severe opioid use disorder based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria, and \u2022 approximately 9% and 22% of participants across the two cohorts newly met criteria for prescription opioid abuse and misuse [defined in Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.2 )] , respectively, as measured with a validated self-reported instrument. A retrospective, observational cohort study estimated the risk of opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death in patients with new long-term use of Schedule II opioid analgesics from 2006 through 2016 (n=220,249). Included patients had been enrolled in either one of two commercial insurance programs, one managed care program, or one Medicaid program for at least 9 months. New long-term use was defined as having Schedule II opioid analgesic prescriptions covering at least 70 days\u2019 supply over the 3 months prior to study entry and none during the preceding 6 months. Patients were excluded if they had an opioid-involved overdose in the 9 months prior to study entry. Overdose was measured using a validated medical code-based algorithm with linkage to the National Death Index database. The 5-year cumulative incidence estimates for opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death ranged from approximately 1.5% to 4% across study sites, counting only the first event during follow-up. Approximately 17% of first opioid overdoses observed over the entire study period (5-11 years, depending on the study site) were fatal. Higher baseline opioid dose was the strongest and most consistent predictor of opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death. Study exclusion criteria may have selected patients at lower risk of overdose, and substantial loss to follow-up (approximately 80%) also may have biased estimates. The risk estimates from the studies described above may not be generalizable to all patients receiving opioid analgesics, such as those with exposures shorter or longer than the duration evaluated in the studies."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4 includes clinically significant drug interactions with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Table 4. Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider recommending or prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 )]. Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids (gabapentin or pregabalin), other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Intervention: The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )]. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Intervention: Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of muscle relaxants and opioids, consider recommending or prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 )] . Examples: cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. \u2022 Serotonergic Drugs : Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) \u2022 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) : Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) \u2022 Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics : Avoid use with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets because they may reduce analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) \u2022 Lactation : Not recommended. ( 8.2 ) \u2022 Severe Hepatic Impairment : Use not recommended. ( 8.6 ) \u2022 Severe Renal Impairment : Consider an alternate analgesic. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, developmental delays, and altered behavioral responses were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 2.1 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 4.8 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 2.3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 2.1 or 17 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data] . Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid overdose reversal agent, such as naloxone or nalmefene, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when use of shorter-acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1.75, 3.5, or 7 mg/kg/day (0.5, 1.1, or 2.1 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 20 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (4.3, 8.5, or 17 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the highest dose group (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (4.8 to 65.4 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (3.5 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.1, 2.3, or 4.6 times the human daily dose of 32 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 2.3 times the human dose of 32 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to Lactation Day 21 via oral gavage doses of 1.75, 3.5, or 7 mg/kg/day (0.5, 1.1, or 2.1 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Reduced pup weights were noted at 1.1 and 2.1 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day and increased pup deaths, delayed ear opening, reduced auditory startle reflex, and reduced open-field activity were also noted at 2.1 times the HDD. Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in all groups) and decreased maternal care in the high dose group. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Low concentrations of hydromorphone have been detected in human milk in clinical trials. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfeeding infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped. Nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets since hydromorphone is excreted in the milk. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients 17 years of age and younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment In a study that used a single 4 mg oral dose of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets, four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-\u221e ) were observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Group B). Start patients with moderate hepatic impairment on 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be used in patients with normal hepatic function. Regularly evaluate patients with moderate hepatic impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients have not been studied. As further increases in C max and AUC 0-\u221e of hydromorphone in this group are expected, use of alternate analgesics is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Administration of a single 4 mg dose of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets resulted in two-fold and four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48h ) in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) impairment, respectively. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with moderate renal impairment on 50% and patients with severe renal impairment on 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal renal function. Regularly evaluate patients with renal impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only intended for once daily administration, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing interval in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] ."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, developmental delays, and altered behavioral responses were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 2.1 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 4.8 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 2.3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 2.1 or 17 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data] . Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid overdose reversal agent, such as naloxone or nalmefene, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when use of shorter-acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1.75, 3.5, or 7 mg/kg/day (0.5, 1.1, or 2.1 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 20 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (4.3, 8.5, or 17 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the highest dose group (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (4.8 to 65.4 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (3.5 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.1, 2.3, or 4.6 times the human daily dose of 32 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 2.3 times the human dose of 32 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to Lactation Day 21 via oral gavage doses of 1.75, 3.5, or 7 mg/kg/day (0.5, 1.1, or 2.1 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Reduced pup weights were noted at 1.1 and 2.1 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day and increased pup deaths, delayed ear opening, reduced auditory startle reflex, and reduced open-field activity were also noted at 2.1 times the HDD. Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in all groups) and decreased maternal care in the high dose group."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contains hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contains hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in combination with other abused drugs. \"Drug-seeking\" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets enhances drug release and increases the risk of overdose and death. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is approved for oral use only. Inappropriate intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, increased risk of endocarditis, and valvular heart injury, and embolism. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] . Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Toxic leukoencephalopathy has been reported after opioid overdose and can present hours, days, or weeks after apparent recovery from the initial intoxication. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the re-establishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid overdose reversal agent such as naloxone or nalmefene. Because the duration of reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets will continue to release hydromorphone and add to the hydromorphone load for up to 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion, necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to an opioid overdose reversal agent is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional reversal agent as directed by the product's prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the opioid overdose reversal agent will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the reversal agent administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the reversal agent should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the reversal agent."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone, a semi-synthetic morphine derivative, is a hydrogenated ketone of morphine. Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics CNS Depressant/Alcohol Interaction Additive pharmacodynamic effects may be expected when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, legal or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression. Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces dose-related respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis, rather than miosis, may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, transient elevations in serum amylase, and opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED). Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Release of histamine may be induced by hydromorphone and can contribute to opioid-induced hypotension. Manifestations of histamine release or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration-Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), ( 2.4 )] . Concentration-Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), ( 2.3 ), ( 2.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are an extended-release formulation of hydromorphone that produces a gradual increase in hydromorphone concentrations. Following a single-dose administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, plasma concentrations gradually increase over 6 to 8 hours, and thereafter concentrations are sustained for approximately 18 to 24 hours post-dose. The median T max values ranged from 12 to 16 hours. The mean half-life was approximately 11 hours, ranging from 8 to 15 hours in most individual subjects. Linear pharmacokinetics has been demonstrated for hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets over the dose range 8 to 64 mg, with a dose-proportional increase in C max and overall exposure (AUC 0-\u221e ) ( see Table 5 ). Steady-state plasma concentrations are approximately twice those observed following the first dose, and steady state is reached after 3 to 4 days of once-daily dosing of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. At steady state, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets given once daily maintained hydromorphone plasma concentrations within the same concentration range as the immediate-release tablet given 4 times daily at the same total daily dose and diminished the fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations seen with the immediate-release tablet ( see Figure 1 ). The bioavailability of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily and immediate-release hydromorphone four times daily in adults is comparable, as presented in Table 5 .

Therefore, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be administered without regard to meals. When a 16 mg dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets was administered to healthy volunteers immediately following a high-fat meal, the median time to C max (T max ) was minimally affected by the high-fat meal occurring at 16 hours compared to 18 hours while fasting. Distribution Following intravenous administration of hydromorphone to healthy volunteers, the mean volume of distribution was 2.9 (\u00b11.3) L/kg, suggesting extensive tissue distribution. The mean extent of binding of hydromorphone to human plasma proteins was determined to be 27% in an in vitro study. Elimination Metabolism After oral administration of an immediate-release formulation, hydromorphone undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and is metabolized primarily in the liver by glucuronidation to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide, which follows a similar time course to hydromorphone in plasma. Exposure to the glucuronide metabolite is 35 to 40 times higher than exposure to the parent drug. In vitro data suggest that hydromorphone in clinically relevant concentrations has minimal potential to inhibit the activity of human hepatic CYP450 enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, and 4A11. Excretion Approximately 75% of the administered dose is excreted in urine. Most of the administered hydromorphone dose is excreted as metabolites. Approximately 7% and 1% of the dose are excreted as unchanged hydromorphone in urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Patients Population PK analysis performed on plasma concentration data from 407 osteoarthritis (OA) patients using hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets showed an average 11% increase in hydromorphone AUC in the elderly group (65 to 75 years of age) when compared to the younger age group (less than or equal to 65 years of age). Sex Females appeared to have approximately 10% higher mean systemic exposure in terms of C max and AUC values. Hepatic Impairment In a study that used a single 4 mg oral dose of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets, four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-\u221e ) were observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Group B). Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC 0-\u221e of hydromorphone in this group is expected. Start patients with moderate hepatic impairment on 25% of the usual dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and closely monitor for respiratory and central nervous system depression during dose titration. Consider alternate analgesic therapy for patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal Impairment Renal impairment affected the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone and its metabolites following administration of a single 4 mg dose of immediate-release tablets. The effects of renal impairment on hydromorphone pharmacokinetics were two-fold and four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48h ) in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) impairment, respectively. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to subjects with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with moderate renal impairment on 50% of the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose for patients with normal renal function and closely monitor for respiratory and central nervous system depression during dose titration. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only intended for once-daily administration, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing interval in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Drug Interaction Studies Alcohol Interaction An in vivo study examined the effect of alcohol (40%, 20%, 4% and 0%) on the bioavailability of a single dose of 16 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in healthy, fasted or fed volunteers. The results showed that the hydromorphone mean AUC 0-\u221e was 5% higher and 4% lower (not statistically significant) in the fasted and fed groups respectively after co-administration of 240 mL of 40% alcohol. The AUC 0-\u221e was similarly unaffected in subjects following the co-administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and alcohol (240 mL of 20% or 4% alcohol). The change in geometric mean C max with concomitant administration of alcohol and hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets ranged from an increase of 10% to 31% across all conditions studied. The change in mean C max was greater in the fasted group of subjects. Following concomitant administration of 240 mL of 40% alcohol while fasting, the mean C max increased by 37% and up to 151% in an individual subject. Following the concomitant administration of 240 mL of 20% alcohol while fasting, the mean C max increased by 35% and up to 139% in an individual subject. Following the concomitant administration of 240 mL of 4% alcohol while fasting, the mean C max increased by 19% on average and as much as 73% for an individual subject. The range of median T max for the fed and fasted treatments with 4%, 20% and 40% alcohol was 12 to 16 hours compared to 16 hours for the 0% alcohol treatments. Figure 1."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone, a semi-synthetic morphine derivative, is a hydrogenated ketone of morphine. Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics CNS Depressant/Alcohol Interaction Additive pharmacodynamic effects may be expected when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, legal or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression. Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces dose-related respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis, rather than miosis, may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, transient elevations in serum amylase, and opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED). Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Release of histamine may be induced by hydromorphone and can contribute to opioid-induced hypotension. Manifestations of histamine release or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration-Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), ( 2.4 )] . Concentration-Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), ( 2.3 ), ( 2.4 )] ."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are an extended-release formulation of hydromorphone that produces a gradual increase in hydromorphone concentrations. Following a single-dose administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, plasma concentrations gradually increase over 6 to 8 hours, and thereafter concentrations are sustained for approximately 18 to 24 hours post-dose. The median T max values ranged from 12 to 16 hours. The mean half-life was approximately 11 hours, ranging from 8 to 15 hours in most individual subjects. Linear pharmacokinetics has been demonstrated for hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets over the dose range 8 to 64 mg, with a dose-proportional increase in C max and overall exposure (AUC 0-\u221e ) ( see Table 5 ). Steady-state plasma concentrations are approximately twice those observed following the first dose, and steady state is reached after 3 to 4 days of once-daily dosing of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. At steady state, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets given once daily maintained hydromorphone plasma concentrations within the same concentration range as the immediate-release tablet given 4 times daily at the same total daily dose and diminished the fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations seen with the immediate-release tablet ( see Figure 1 ). The bioavailability of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily and immediate-release hydromorphone four times daily in adults is comparable, as presented in Table 5 . Figure 1. Mean Steady-State Plasma Concentration Profile Table 5.

Therefore, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be administered without regard to meals. When a 16 mg dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets was administered to healthy volunteers immediately following a high-fat meal, the median time to C max (T max ) was minimally affected by the high-fat meal occurring at 16 hours compared to 18 hours while fasting. Distribution Following intravenous administration of hydromorphone to healthy volunteers, the mean volume of distribution was 2.9 (\u00b11.3) L/kg, suggesting extensive tissue distribution.

Approximately 7% and 1% of the dose are excreted as unchanged hydromorphone in urine and feces, respectively.

Sex Females appeared to have approximately 10% higher mean systemic exposure in terms of C max and AUC values. Hepatic Impairment In a study that used a single 4 mg oral dose of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets, four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-\u221e ) were observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Group B). Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC 0-\u221e of hydromorphone in this group is expected. Start patients with moderate hepatic impairment on 25% of the usual dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and closely monitor for respiratory and central nervous system depression during dose titration. Consider alternate analgesic therapy for patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal Impairment Renal impairment affected the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone and its metabolites following administration of a single 4 mg dose of immediate-release tablets. The effects of renal impairment on hydromorphone pharmacokinetics were two-fold and four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48h ) in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) impairment, respectively. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to subjects with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with moderate renal impairment on 50% of the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose for patients with normal renal function and closely monitor for respiratory and central nervous system depression during dose titration. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only intended for once-daily administration, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing interval in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Drug Interaction Studies Alcohol Interaction An in vivo study examined the effect of alcohol (40%, 20%, 4% and 0%) on the bioavailability of a single dose of 16 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in healthy, fasted or fed volunteers. The results showed that the hydromorphone mean AUC 0-\u221e was 5% higher and 4% lower (not statistically significant) in the fasted and fed groups respectively after co-administration of 240 mL of 40% alcohol. The AUC 0-\u221e was similarly unaffected in subjects following the co-administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and alcohol (240 mL of 20% or 4% alcohol). The change in geometric mean C max with concomitant administration of alcohol and hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets ranged from an increase of 10% to 31% across all conditions studied. The change in mean C max was greater in the fasted group of subjects. Following concomitant administration of 240 mL of 40% alcohol while fasting, the mean C max increased by 37% and up to 151% in an individual subject. Following the concomitant administration of 240 mL of 20% alcohol while fasting, the mean C max increased by 35% and up to 139% in an individual subject. Following the concomitant administration of 240 mL of 4% alcohol while fasting, the mean C max increased by 19% on average and as much as 73% for an individual subject. The range of median T max for the fed and fasted treatments with 4%, 20% and 40% alcohol was 12 to 16 hours compared to 16 hours for the 0% alcohol treatments. Figure 1."

Hydromorphone HCl was administered to Han-Wistar rats (2, 5, and 15 mg/kg/day for males, and 8, 25 and 75 mg/kg/day for females) for 2 years by oral gavage. In female rats, incidences of hibernoma (tumor of brown fat) were increased at 10.5 times the maximum recommended daily exposure based on AUC at the mid dose (2 tumor, 25 mg/kg/day) and 53.7 times the maximum recommended human daily exposure based on AUC at the maximum dose (4 tumors, 75 mg/kg/day). The clinical relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in male rats. The systemic drug exposure (AUC, ng\u2022h/mL) at the 15 mg/kg/day in male rats was 7.6 times greater than the human exposure at a single dose of 32 mg/day of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential in Crl:CD1\u00ae (ICR) mice administered hydromorphone HCl at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day for 2 years by oral gavage. The systemic drug exposure (AUC, ng\u2022h/mL) at the 15 mg/kg/day in mice was 1.1 (in males) and 1.2 (in females) times greater than the human exposure at a single dose of 32 mg/day of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Mutagenesis Hydromorphone was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay). Hydromorphone was not clastogenic in either the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Impairment of Fertility Reduced implantation sites and viable fetuses were noted at 2.1 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day in a study in which female rats were treated orally with 1.75, 3.5, or 7 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (0.7, 1.4, or 2.8 times a human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD) based on body surface area) beginning 14 days prior to mating through Gestation Day 7 and male rats were treated with the same hydromorphone hydrochloride doses beginning 28 days prior to and throughout mating."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets was investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study in opioid tolerant patients with moderate-to-severe low back pain. Patients were considered opioid tolerant if they were currently on opioid therapy that was \u2265 60 mg/day of oral morphine equivalent for at least 2 months prior to screening. Patients entered an open-label conversion and titration phase with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, were converted to a starting dose that was approximately 75% of their total daily morphine equivalent dose, and were dosed once daily until adequate pain control was achieved while exhibiting tolerable side effects. Supplemental immediate-release hydromorphone tablets were allowed throughout the study. Patients who achieved a stable dose entered a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized treatment phase. Mean daily dose at randomization was 37.8 mg/day (range of 12 mg/day to 64 mg/day). Fifty-eight (58) percent of patients were successfully titrated to a stable dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets during the open-label conversion and titration phase. During the double-blind treatment phase, patients randomized to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets continued with the stable dose achieved in the conversion and titration phase of the study. Patients randomized to placebo received, in a blinded manner, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and matching placebo in doses tapering from the stable dose achieved in conversion and titration. During the taper down period, patients were allowed immediate-release hydromorphone tablets as supplemental analgesia to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms in placebo patients. After the taper period, the number of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets was limited to two tablets per day. Forty-nine (49) percent of patients treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 33% of patients treated with placebo completed the 12-week treatment period. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets provided superior analgesia compared to placebo. There was a significant difference between the mean changes from Baseline to Week 12 or Final Visit in average weekly pain intensity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores obtained from patient diaries between the two groups. The proportion of patients with various degrees of improvement from screening to Week 12 or Final Visit is shown in Figure 2 . For this analysis, patients who discontinued treatment for any reason prior to Week 12 were assigned a value of zero improvement. Figure 2.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are indicated in opioid-tolerant patients for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an opioid analgesic and that cannot be adequately treated with alternative options, including immediate-release opioids. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, misuse, overdose, and death, which can occur at any dosage or duration and persist over the course of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )], reserve opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are an opioid agonist indicated in opioid-tolerant patients for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an opioid analgesic and that cannot be adequately treated with alternative options, including immediate-release opioids. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid ( 1 ). Limitations of Use: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, misuse, overdose, and death, which can occur at any dosage or duration and persist over the course of therapy, reserve opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 5.1 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments ( 2.1 , 5.2 ). For once daily administration IN OPIOID-TOLERANT PATIENTS. ( 2.1 ) Instruct patients to swallow hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets intact, and not to cut, break, chew, crush, or dissolve the tablets (risk of potentially fatal overdose). ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) Discuss opioid overdose reversal agents and options for acquiring them with the patient and/or caregiver, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially if the patient has additional risk factors for overdose, or close contacts at risk for exposure and overdose. ( 2.2 , 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 ) Dose may be increased using increments of 4 to 8 mg every 3 to 4 days as needed to achieve adequate analgesia. ( 2.4 ) Periodically reassess patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to evaluate the continued need for opioid analgesics to maintain pain control for the signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse. ( 2.4 ) Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a physically-dependent patient because rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. ( 2.5 , 5.13 ) Moderate Hepatic Impairment: Initiate treatment with 25% of the dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal hepatic function. Monitor closely for respiratory and central nervous system depression. ( 2.6 ) Moderate and Severe Renal Impairment: Initiate treatment in patients with moderate renal impairment with 50% and patients with severe renal impairment with 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal renal function. Monitor closely for respiratory and central nervous system depression. ( 2.7 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information To avoid medication errors, prescribers and pharmacists must be aware that hydromorphone is available as both immediate-release 8 mg tablets and extended-release 8 mg tablets. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Due to the risk of respiratory depression, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only indicated for use in patients who are already opioid-tolerant. Discontinue or taper all other extended-release opioids when beginning hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only for use in opioid-tolerant patients, do not begin any patient on hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets as the first opioid. Patients who are opioid-tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg of oral morphine per day, at least 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone per day, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per day, at least 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, at least 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are administered orally once daily IN OPIOID-TOLERANT PATIENTS. Instruct patients to swallow hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets whole [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . Crushing, chewing, or dissolving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of hydromorphone and can lead to overdose or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 2.2 Patient Access to an Opioid Overdose Reversal Agent for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Inform patients and caregivers about opioid overdose reversal agents (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene). Discuss the importance of having access to an opioid overdose reversal agent, especially if the patient has risk factors for overdose (e.g., concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose) or if there are household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the management of pain in any patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 ) . Discuss the options for obtaining an opioid overdose reversal agent (e.g., prescription, over-the-counter, or as part of a community-based program) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . There are important differences among the opioid overdose reversal agents, such as route of administration, product strength, approved patient age range, and pharmacokinetics. Be familiar with these differences, as outlined in the approved labeling for those products, prior to recommending or prescribing such an agent. 2.3 Initial Dosage It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour oral hydromorphone dosage and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral hydromorphone dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Frequently reevaluate patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and for signs of oversedation/toxicity after converting patients to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Conversion from Other Oral Opioid Analgesics to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets When hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy is initiated, discontinue all opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate. In a hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets clinical trial with an open-label titration period, patients were converted from their prior opioid to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets using the Table 1 as a guide for the initial hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose. The recommended starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is 50% of the calculated estimate of daily hydromorphone requirement. Calculate the estimated daily hydromorphone requirement using Table 1 . Consider the following when using the information in Table 1 : This is not a table of equianalgesic doses. The conversion factors in this table are only for the conversion from one of the listed oral opioid analgesics to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. The table cannot be used to convert from hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to another opioid. Doing so will result in an overestimation of the dose of the new opioid and may result in fatal overdose. Table 1. Conversion Factors to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets To calculate the estimated hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose using Table 1 : For patients on a single opioid, sum the current total daily dose of the opioid and then multiply the total daily dose by the conversion factor to calculate the approximate oral hydromorphone daily dose. For patients on a regimen of more than one opioid, calculate the approximate oral hydromorphone dose for each opioid and sum the totals to obtain the approximate total hydromorphone daily dose. For patients on a regimen of fixed-ratio opioid/non-opioid analgesic products, use only the opioid component of these products in the conversion. Always round the dose down, if necessary, to the appropriate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets strength(s) available. Example conversion from a single opioid to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets: Step 1: Sum the total daily dose of the opioid 30 mg of oxycodone 2 times daily = 60 mg total daily dose of oxycodone Step 2: Calculate the approximate equivalent dose of oral hydromorphone based on the total daily dose of the current opioid using Table 1 60 mg total daily dose of oxycodone x Conversion Factor of 0.4 = 24 mg of oral hydromorphone daily Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to be given every 24 hours, which is 50% of the calculated oral hydromorphone dose. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets strengths available. 50% of 24 mg results in an initial dose of 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily Adjust individually for each patient Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Conversion from Methadone to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma. Conversion from Fentanyl Transdermal System to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Eighteen hours following the removal of the fentanyl transdermal system, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets treatment can be initiated. To calculate the 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose, use a conversion factor of 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal system to 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Then reduce the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose by 50%. For example: Step 1: Identify the dose of transdermal fentanyl. 75 mg of transdermal fentanyl Step 2: Use the conversion factor of 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal system to 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 75 mg of transdermal fentanyl: 36 mg total daily dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to be given every 24 hours, which is 50% of the converted dose. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets strengths available. 50% of 36 mg results in an initial dose of 18 mg, which would be rounded down to 16 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily Adjust individually for each patient Table 1 2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.13 )] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During use of opioid therapy for an extended period of time, periodically reassess the continued need for opioid analgesics. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. Plasma levels of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are sustained for 18 to 24 hours. Dosage adjustments of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be made in increments of 4 to 8 mg every 3 to 4 days as needed to achieve adequate analgesia. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dose increase of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, the subsequent doses may be reduced. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.5 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )]. 2.6 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Moderate Hepatic Impairment Start patients with moderate hepatic impairment on 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal hepatic function. Closely monitor patients with moderate hepatic impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. Use of alternate analgesics is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 2.7 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Start patients with moderate renal impairment on 50% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal renal function. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only intended for once daily administration, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing interval in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation. ( 5.6 ) Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or Elderly Cachectic Debilitated Patients: Regularly evaluate closely, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.7 ) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.8 ) Severe Hypotension: Regularly evaluate during dose initiation and titration. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.9 ) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain, Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )] . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. The risk of opioid-related overdose or overdose-related death is increased with higher opioid doses, and this risk persists over the course of therapy. In postmarketing studies, addiction, abuse, misuse, and fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose were observed in patients with long-term opioid use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, and reassess all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider recommending or prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Abuse or misuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of hydromorphone and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Opioids are sought for non-medical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modified-release opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid overdose reversal agents, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Patient Access to an Opioid Overdose Reversal Agent for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Inform patients and caregivers about opioid overdose reversal agents (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene). Discuss the importance of having access to an opioid overdose reversal agent, especially if the patient has risk factors for overdose (e.g., concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose) or if there are household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the management of pain in any patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.3 )] . Discuss the options for obtaining an opioid overdose reversal agent (e.g., prescription, over-the-counter, or as part of a community-based program). There are important differences among the opioid overdose reversal agents, such as route of administration, product strength, approved patient age range, and pharmacokinetics. Be familiar with these differences, as outlined in the approved labeling for those products, prior to recommending or prescribing such an agent. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression, and how to use an opioid overdose reversal agent for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose. Emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if an opioid overdose reversal agent is administered [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.3 ), Overdosage ( 10 )]. 5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids [gabapentin or pregabalin], and other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider recommending or prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. 5.5 Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG. Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com. The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint. 5.6 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence ( 9.3 )] . Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safety switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ); Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] . 5.7 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.9 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure . Regularly evaluate such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.11 Risk of Gastrointestinal Complications Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with other GI obstruction. Because the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are nondeformable and does not appreciably change in shape in the GI tract, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic, for example: esophageal motility disorders, small bowel inflammatory disease, \u201cshort gut\u201d syndrome due to adhesions or decreased transit time, past history of peritonitis, cystic fibrosis, chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, or Meckel\u2019s diverticulum). There have been reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures or risk of strictures, such as previous GI surgery, in association with the ingestion of drugs in nondeformable extended-release formulations. It is possible that hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be visible on abdominal x-rays under certain circumstances, especially when digital enhancing techniques are utilized. The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Cases of opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED) have been reported in patients taking opioids. The risk of OIED may increase as the dose and/or duration of opioids increases. Regularly evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of OIED (e.g., dysphagia, regurgitation, non-cardiac chest pain), and if necessary, adjust opioid therapy as clinically appropriate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. 5.12 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. 5.13 Withdrawal Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] . Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.14 Sulfites Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . 5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may impair the mental and/or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and know how they will react to the medication [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Interactions with Benzodiazepine or Other CNS Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Severe Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia [See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) are: constipation, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, headache, and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Trigen Laboratories, LLC at 1-800-444-5164 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered to a total of 2,524 patients in 15 controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies. Of these, 423 patients were exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for greater than 6 months and 141 exposed for greater than one year. The most common adverse reactions leading to study discontinuation were nausea, vomiting, constipation, somnolence, and dizziness. The most common treatment-related serious adverse reactions from controlled and uncontrolled chronic pain studies were drug withdrawal syndrome, overdose, confusional state, and constipation. The overall incidence of adverse reactions in patients greater than 65 years of age was higher, with a greater than 5% difference in rates for constipation and nausea when compared with younger patients. The overall incidence of adverse reactions in female patients was higher, with a greater than 5% difference in rates for nausea, vomiting, constipation and somnolence when compared with male patients. A 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study was conducted in opioid tolerant patients with moderate to severe low back pain [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . A total of 447 patients were enrolled into the open-label titration phase with 268 patients randomized into the double-blind treatment phase. The adverse reactions that were reported in at least 2% of the patients are contained in Table 2 . Table 2. Number (%) of Patients with Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 2% of Patients with Moderate to Severe Low Back Pain During the Open-Label Titration Phase or Double-Blind Treatment Phase by Preferred Term The adverse reactions that were reported in at least 2% of the total treated patients (N=2,474) in the 14 chronic clinical trials are contained in Table 3 . Table 3.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Anaphylaxis: Anaphylactic reaction has been reported with ingredients contained in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Hypoglycemia: Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor (e.g., diabetes). Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED) : Cases of OIED have been reported in patients taking opioids, and may occur more frequently in patients taking higher doses of opioids, and/or in patients taking opioids longer term [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . Adverse Reactions from Observational Studies A prospective, observational cohort study estimated the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse in patients initiating long-term use of Schedule II opioid analgesics between 2017 and 2021. Study participants included in one or more analyses had been enrolled in selected insurance plans or health systems for at least one year, were free of at least one outcome at baseline, completed a minimum number of follow-up assessments, and either: 1) filled multiple extended-release/long-acting opioid analgesic prescriptions during a 90 day period (n=978); or 2) filled any Schedule II opioid analgesic prescriptions covering at least 70 of 90 days (n=1,244). Those included also had no dispensing of the qualifying opioids in the previous 6 months. Over 12 months: Approximately 1% to 6% of participants across the two cohorts newly met criteria for addiction, as assessed with two validated interview-based measures of moderate-to-severe opioid use disorder based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria, and Approximately 9% and 22% of participants across the two cohorts newly met criteria for prescription opioid abuse and misuse [defined in Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.2 )] , respectively, as measured with a validated self-reported instrument. A retrospective, observational cohort study estimated the risk of opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death in patients with new long-term use of Schedule II opioid analgesics from 2006 through 2016 (n=220,249). Included patients had been enrolled in either one of two commercial insurance programs, one managed care program, or one Medicaid program for at least 9 months. New Long-term use was defined as having Schedule II opioid analgesic prescriptions covering at least 70 days\u2019 supply over the 3 months prior to study entry and none during the preceding 6 months. Patients were excluded if they had an opioid-involved overdose in the 9 months prior to study entry. Overdose was measured using a validated medical code-based algorithm with linkage to the National Death Index database. The 5-year cumulative incidence estimates for opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death ranged from approximately 1.5% to 4% across study sites, counting only the first event during follow-up. Approximately 17% of first opioid overdoses observed over the entire study period (5-11 years, depending on the study site) were fatal. Higher baseline opioid dose was the strongest and most consistent predictor of opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death. Study exclusion criteria may have selected patients at lower risk of overdose, and substantial loss to follow-up (approximately 80%) also may have biased estimates. The risk estimates from the studies described above may not be generalizable to all patients receiving opioid analgesics, such as those with exposures shorter or longer than the duration evaluated in the studies."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4 includes clinically significant drug interactions with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Table 4. Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider recommending or prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent. Evaluate for signs of opioid withdrawal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 )] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids [gabapentin or pregabalin], other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Evaluate for signs of opioid withdrawal. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Intervention: The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Evaluate for signs of opioid withdrawal. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )]. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Intervention: Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of skeletal muscle relaxants and opioids, consider recommending or prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent. Evaluate for signs of opioid withdrawal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 )]. Examples: cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets because they may reduce analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Not recommended. ( 8.2 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Use not recommended. ( 8.6 ) Severe Renal Impairment: Consider an alternate analgesic. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, developmental delays, and altered behavioral responses were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 2.1 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 4.8 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 2.3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 2.1 or 17 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid overdose reversal agent, such as naloxone or nalmefene, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when use of shorter-acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1.75, 3.5, or 7 mg/kg/day (0.5, 1.1, or 2.1 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 20 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (4.3, 8.5, or 17 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the highest dose group (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (4.8 to 65.4 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (3.5 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.1, 2.3, or 4.6 times the human daily dose of 32 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 2.3 times the human dose of 32 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to Lactation Day 21 via oral gavage doses of 1.75, 3.5, or 7 mg/kg/day (0.5, 1.1, or 2.1 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Reduced pup weights were noted at 1.1 and 2.1 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day and increased pup deaths, delayed ear opening, reduced auditory startle reflex, and reduced open-field activity were also noted at 2.1 times the HDD. Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in all groups) and decreased maternal care in the high dose group. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Low concentrations of hydromorphone have been detected in human milk in clinical trials. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfeeding infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped. Nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets since hydromorphone is excreted in the milk. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients 17 years of age and younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment In a study that used a single 4 mg oral dose of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets, four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-\u221e ) were observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Group B). Start patients with moderate hepatic impairment on 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be used in patients with normal hepatic function. Closely monitor patients with moderate hepatic impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients have not been studied. As further increases in C max and AUC 0-\u221e of hydromorphone in this group are expected, use of alternate analgesics is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Administration of a single 4 mg dose of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets resulted in two-fold and four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48h ) in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) impairment, respectively. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with moderate renal impairment on 50% and patients with severe renal impairment on 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal renal function. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only intended for once daily administration, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing interval in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] ."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contain hydromorphone, a substance with a high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent re-evaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in combination with other abused drugs. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with alcohol and/or other central nervous system depressants. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets enhances drug release and increases the risk of overdose and death. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are approved for oral use only. Inappropriate intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, increased risk of endocarditis, and valvular heart injury, and embolism. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )]. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]."

Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent re-evaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in combination with other abused drugs. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with alcohol and/or other central nervous system depressants. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets enhances drug release and increases the risk of overdose and death. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are approved for oral use only. Inappropriate intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, increased risk of endocarditis, and valvular heart injury, and embolism. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV."

    "dependence": [
      "9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )]. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdosage with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Toxic leukoencephalopathy has been reported after opioid overdose and can present hours, days, or weeks after apparent recovery from the initial intoxication. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the re-establishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life support measures. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid overdose reversal agent such as naloxone or nalmefene. Because the duration of reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets will continue to release hydromorphone and add to the hydromorphone load for up to 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion, necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to an opioid overdose reversal agent is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional reversal agent as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the opioid overdose reversal agent will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the reversal agent administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the reversal agent."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone, a semi-synthetic morphine derivative, is a hydrogenated ketone of morphine. Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics CNS Depressant/Alcohol Interaction Additive pharmacodynamic effects may be expected when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, legal or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression. Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces dose-related respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis, rather than miosis, may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, transient elevations in serum amylase, and opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED). Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Release of histamine may be induced by hydromorphone and can contribute to opioid-induced hypotension. Manifestations of histamine release or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration-Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), ( 2.4 )] . Concentration-Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), ( 2.3 ), ( 2.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are an extended-release formulation of hydromorphone that produces a gradual increase in hydromorphone concentrations. Following a single-dose administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, plasma concentrations gradually increase over 6 to 8 hours, and thereafter concentrations are sustained for approximately 18 to 24 hours post-dose. The median T max values ranged from 12 to 16 hours. The mean half-life was approximately 11 hours, ranging from 8 to 15 hours in most individual subjects. Linear pharmacokinetics has been demonstrated for hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets over the dose range 8 to 64 mg, with a dose-proportional increase in C max and overall exposure (AUC 0-\u221e ) ( see Table 5 ). Steady-state plasma concentrations are approximately twice those observed following the first dose, and steady state is reached after 3 to 4 days of once-daily dosing of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. At steady state, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets given once daily maintained hydromorphone plasma concentrations within the same concentration range as the immediate-release tablet given 4 times daily at the same total daily dose and diminished the fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations seen with the immediate-release tablet ( see Figure 1 ). The bioavailability of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily and immediate-release hydromorphone four times daily in adults is comparable, as presented in Table 5 . Table 5. Mean (\u00b1SD) Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Pharmacokinetic Parameters NA = not applicable *Median (range) reported for T max \u2020 Steady-state results on Day 5 (0-24 hours) \u2021 C min 2.15 (0.87) ng/mL \u00a7 C min 1.47 (0.42) ng/mL Food Effect The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not affected by food as indicated by bioequivalence when administered under fed and fasting conditions. Therefore, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be administered without regard to meals. When a 16 mg dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered to healthy volunteers immediately following a high-fat meal, the median time to C max (T max ) was minimally affected by the high-fat meal occurring at 16 hours compared to 18 hours while fasting. Distribution Following intravenous administration of hydromorphone to healthy volunteers, the mean volume of distribution was 2.9 (\u00b11.3) L/kg, suggesting extensive tissue distribution. The mean extent of binding of hydromorphone to human plasma proteins was determined to be 27% in an in vitro study. Elimination Metabolism After oral administration of an immediate-release formulation, hydromorphone undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and is metabolized primarily in the liver by glucuronidation to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide, which follows a similar time course to hydromorphone in plasma. Exposure to the glucuronide metabolite is 35 to 40 times higher than exposure to the parent drug. In vitro data suggest that hydromorphone in clinically relevant concentrations has minimal potential to inhibit the activity of human hepatic CYP450 enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, and 4A11. Excretion Approximately 75% of the administered dose is excreted in urine. Most of the administered hydromorphone dose is excreted as metabolites. Approximately 7% and 1% of the dose are excreted as unchanged hydromorphone in urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Patients Population PK analysis performed on plasma concentration data from 407 osteoarthritis (OA) patients using hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets showed an average 11% increase in hydromorphone AUC in the elderly group (65 to 75 years of age) when compared to the younger age group (less than or equal to 65 years of age). Sex Females appeared to have approximately 10% higher mean systemic exposure in terms of C max and AUC values. Hepatic Impairment In a study that used a single 4 mg oral dose of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets, four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0- \u221e) were observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Group B). Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC 0- \u221e of hydromorphone in this group is expected. Start patients with moderate hepatic impairment on 25% of the usual dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and closely monitor for respiratory and central nervous system depression during dose titration. Consider alternate analgesic therapy for patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal Impairment Renal impairment affected the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone and its metabolites following administration of a single 4 mg dose of immediate-release tablets. The effects of renal impairment on hydromorphone pharmacokinetics were two-fold and four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48h ) in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) impairment, respectively. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to subjects with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with moderate renal impairment on 50% of the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose for patients with normal renal function and closely monitor for respiratory and central nervous system depression during dose titration. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only intended for once-daily administration, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing interval in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Drug Interaction Studies Alcohol Interaction An in vivo study examined the effect of alcohol (40%, 20%, 4% and 0%) on the bioavailability of a single dose of 16 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in healthy, fasted or fed volunteers. The results showed that the hydromorphone mean AUC 0- \u221e was 5% higher and 4% lower (not statistically significant) in the fasted and fed groups respectively after co-administration of 240 mL of 40% alcohol. The AUC 0- \u221e was similarly unaffected in subjects following the co-administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and alcohol (240 mL of 20% or 4% alcohol). The change in geometric mean C max with concomitant administration of alcohol and hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets ranged from an increase of 10% to 31% across all conditions studied. The change in mean C max was greater in the fasted group of subjects. Following concomitant administration of 240 mL of 40% alcohol while fasting, the mean C max increased by 37% and up to 151% in an individual subject. Following the concomitant administration of 240 mL of 20% alcohol while fasting, the mean C max increased by 35% and up to 139% in an individual subject. Following the concomitant administration of 240 mL of 4% alcohol while fasting, the mean C max increased by 19% on average and as much as 73% for an individual subject. The range of median T max for the fed and fasted treatments with 4%, 20% and 40% alcohol was 12 to 16 hours compared to 16 hours for the 0% alcohol treatments. Figure 1 Table 5"

Hydromorphone HCl was administered to Han-Wistar rats (2, 5, and 15 mg/kg/day for males, and 8, 25 and 75 mg/kg/day for females) for 2 years by oral gavage. In female rats, incidences of hibernoma (tumor of brown fat) were increased at 10.5 times the maximum recommended daily exposure based on AUC at the mid dose (2 tumor, 25 mg/kg/day) and 53.7 times the maximum recommended human daily exposure based on AUC at the maximum dose (4 tumors, 75 mg/kg/day). The clinical relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in male rats. The systemic drug exposure (AUC, ng\u00b7h/mL) at the 15 mg/kg/day in male rats was 7.6 times greater than the human exposure at a single dose of 32 mg/day of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential in Crl:CD1 \u00ae (ICR) mice administered hydromorphone HCl at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day for 2 years by oral gavage. The systemic drug exposure (AUC, ng\u2022h/mL) at the 15 mg/kg/day in mice was 1.1 (in males) and 1.2 (in females) times greater than the human exposure at a single dose of 32 mg/day of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Mutagenesis Hydromorphone was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay). Hydromorphone was not clastogenic in either the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Impairment of Fertility Reduced implantation sites and viable fetuses were noted at 2.1 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day in a study in which female rats were treated orally with 1.75, 3.5, or 7 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (0.7, 1.4, or 2.8 times a human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD) based on body surface area) beginning 14 days prior to mating through Gestation Day 7 and male rats were treated with the same hydromorphone hydrochloride doses beginning 28 days prior to and throughout mating."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hydromorphone hydrochloride were completed in both Han-Wistar rats and Crl:CD1 \u00ae (ICR) mice. Hydromorphone HCl was administered to Han-Wistar rats (2, 5, and 15 mg/kg/day for males, and 8, 25 and 75 mg/kg/day for females) for 2 years by oral gavage. In female rats, incidences of hibernoma (tumor of brown fat) were increased at 10.5 times the maximum recommended daily exposure based on AUC at the mid dose (2 tumor, 25 mg/kg/day) and 53.7 times the maximum recommended human daily exposure based on AUC at the maximum dose (4 tumors, 75 mg/kg/day).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study in opioid tolerant patients with moderate-to-severe low back pain. Patients were considered opioid tolerant if they were currently on opioid therapy that was \u2265 60 mg/day of oral morphine equivalent for at least 2 months prior to screening. Patients entered an open-label conversion and titration phase with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, were converted to a starting dose that was approximately 75% of their total daily morphine equivalent dose, and were dosed once daily until adequate pain control was achieved while exhibiting tolerable side effects. Supplemental immediate-release hydromorphone tablets were allowed throughout the study. Patients who achieved a stable dose entered a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized treatment phase. Mean daily dose at randomization was 37.8 mg/day (range of 12 mg/day to 64 mg/day). Fifty-eight (58) percent of patients were successfully titrated to a stable dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets during the open-label conversion and titration phase. During the double-blind treatment phase, patients randomized to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets continued with the stable dose achieved in the conversion and titration phase of the study. Patients randomized to placebo received, in a blinded manner, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and matching placebo in doses tapering from the stable dose achieved in conversion and titration. During the taper down period, patients were allowed immediate-release hydromorphone tablets as supplemental analgesia to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms in placebo patients. After the taper period, the number of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets was limited to two tablets per day. Forty-nine (49) percent of patients treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 33% of patients treated with placebo completed the 12-week treatment period. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets provided superior analgesia compared to placebo. There was a significant difference between the mean changes from Baseline to Week 12 or Final Visit in average weekly pain intensity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores obtained from patient diaries between the two groups. The proportion of patients with various degrees of improvement from screening to Week 12 or Final Visit is shown in Figure 2 . For this analysis, patients who discontinued treatment for any reason prior to Week 12 were assigned a value of zero improvement. Figure 2"

      "WARNING: SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING RISKS FROM USE OF HYDROMORPHONE HYDROCHLORIDE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Because the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death, assess each patient\u2019s risk prior to prescribing and reassess all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially during initiation or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are essential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Accidental Ingestion Accidental ingestion of even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of hydromorphone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7)]. Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS) If opioid use is required for an extended period of time in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of NOWS, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. Ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to complete a REMS-compliant education program and to counsel patients and caregivers on serious risks, safe use, and the importance of reading the Medication Guide with each prescription [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. WARNING: SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING RISKS FROM USE OF HYDROMORPHONE HYDROCHLORIDE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess patient\u2019s risk before prescribing, and monitor regularly for these behaviors and conditions. (5.1) Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets whole to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal dose of hydromorphone. (5.2) Accidental ingestion of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially by children, can result in fatal overdose of hydromorphone. (5.2) Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required; and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. (5.3, 7) Prolonged use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. (5.4) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended-release/long-acting opioid formulations, [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], reserve hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are an opioid agonist indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended-release/long-acting opioid formulations, reserve hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain. (1) Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic. (1)"

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. (2.1) For once daily administration IN OPIOID-TOLERANT PATIENTS. (2.1) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. (2.1, 5) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse (5.1) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments (2.1, 5.2) Instruct patients to swallow hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets intact, and not to cut, break, chew, crush, or dissolve the tablets (risk of potentially fatal overdose). (2.1, 5.1) Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient\u2019s need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose. [2.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3]. Dose may be increased using increments of 4 to 8 mg every 3 to 4 days as needed to achieve adequate analgesia. (2.4) Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a physically-dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. (2.5, 5.13) Moderate Hepatic Impairment: Initiate treatment with 25% of the dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal hepatic function. Monitor closely for respiratory and central nervous system depression. (2.6) Moderate and Severe Renal Impairment: Initiate treatment in patients with moderate renal impairment with 50% and patients with severe renal impairment with 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal renal function. Monitor closely for respiratory and central nervous system depression. (2.7) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions To avoid medication errors, prescribers and pharmacists must be aware that hydromorphone is available as both immediate-release 8 mg tablets and extended-release 8 mg tablets. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Due to the risk of respiratory depression, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only indicated for use in patients who are already opioid-tolerant. Discontinue or taper all other extended-release opioids when beginning hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only for use in opioid-tolerant patients, do not begin any patient on hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets as the first opioid. Patients who are opioid-tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg of oral morphine per day, at least 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone per day, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per day, at least 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, at least 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Instruct patients to swallow hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets whole [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Crushing, chewing, or dissolving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of hydromorphone and can lead to overdose or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Patient Counseling Information (17)] . Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3]. Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. 2.3 Initial Dosage Conversion from Other Oral Hydromorphone Formulations to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Patients receiving oral immediate-release hydromorphone may be converted to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets by administering a starting dose equivalent to the patient\u2019s total daily oral hydromorphone dose, taken once daily. Conversion from other oral opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets When hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate. There is substantial inter-patient variability in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour oral hydromorphone dosage and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral hydromorphone dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. In an hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets clinical trial with an open-label titration period, patients were converted from their prior opioid to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets using the Table 1 as a guide for the initial hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose. The recommended starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are 50% of the calculated estimate of daily hydromorphone requirement. Calculate the estimated daily hydromorphone requirement using Table 1. Consider the following when using the information in Table 1: This is not a table of equianalgesic doses. The conversion factors in this table are only for the conversion from one of the listed oral opioid analgesics to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. The table cannot be used to convert from hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to another opioid. Doing so will result in an overestimation of the dose of the new opioid and may result in fatal overdose. Table 1. Conversion Factors to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Prior Oral Opioid Approximate Oral Conversion Factor Hydromorphone 1 Codeine 0.06 Hydrocodone 0.4 Methadone 0.6 Morphine 0.2 Oxycodone 0.4 Oxymorphone 0.6 To calculate the estimated hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose using Table 1 : For patients on a single opioid, sum the current total daily dose of the opioid and then multiply the total daily dose by the conversion factor to calculate the approximate oral hydromorphone daily dose. For patients on a regimen of more than one opioid, calculate the approximate oral hydromorphone dose for each opioid and sum the totals to obtain the approximate total hydromorphone daily dose. For patients on a regimen of fixed-ratio opioid/non-opioid analgesic products, use only the opioid component of these products in the conversion. Always round the dose down, if necessary, to the appropriate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets strength(s) available. Example conversion from a single opioid to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets: Step 1: Sum the total daily dose of the opioid 30 mg of oxycodone 2 times daily = 60 mg total daily dose of oxycodone Step 2: Calculate the approximate equivalent dose of oral hydromorphone based on the total daily dose of the current opioid using Table 1 60 mg total daily dose of oxycodone x Conversion Factor of 0.4 = 24 mg of oral hydromorphone daily Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to be given every 24 hours, which is 50% of the calculated oral hydromorphone dose. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablet strengths available. 50% of 24 mg results in an initial dose of 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily Adjust individually for each patient Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal or for signs of over-sedation/toxicity after converting patients to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets treatment can be initiated. To calculate the 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose, use a conversion factor of 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal patch to 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Then reduce the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose by 50%. For example: Step 1: Identify the dose of transdermal fentanyl. 75 mg of transdermal fentanyl Step 2: Use the conversion factor of 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal patch to 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 75 mg of transdermal fentanyl: 36 mg total daily dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to be given every 24 hours, which is 50% of the converted dose. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablet strengths available. 50% of 36 mg results in an initial dose of 18 mg, which would be rounded down to 16 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily Adjust individually for each patient Conversion from Methadone to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma. 2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.13)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During use of opioid therapy for an extended period of time, periodically reassess the continued need for use of opioid analgesics. Plasma levels of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are sustained for 18 to 24 hours. Dosage adjustments of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be made in increments of 4 to 8 mg every 3 to 4 days as needed to achieve adequate analgesia. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dose increase of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.5 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. 2.6 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Moderate Hepatic Impairment Start patients with moderate hepatic impairment on 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal hepatic function. Closely monitor patients with moderate hepatic impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. Use of alternate analgesics is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 2.7 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Start patients with moderate renal impairment on 50% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal renal function. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only intended for once daily administration, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing interval in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) and Allodynia : Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation. (5.6) Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or Elderly Cachectic Debilitated Patients: Regularly evaluate closely, particularly during initiation and titration. (5.7) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. (5.8) Severe Hypotension: Regularly evaluate during dose initiation and titration. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with circulatory shock. (5.9) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. (5.10) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contains hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of hydromorphone present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, and reassess all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Abuse or misuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of hydromorphone and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modified-release opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3, Patient Counseling Information (17); Overdosage (10)]. 5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)]. If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.5 Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG. Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com. The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint. 5.6 Opioid Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3)]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5); Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. 5.7 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5), Drug Interactions (7)]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.9 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with other GI obstruction. Because the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablet is nondeformable and does not appreciably change in shape in the GI tract, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic, for example: esophageal motility disorders, small bowel inflammatory disease, \u201cshort gut\u201d syndrome due to adhesions or decreased transit time, past history of peritonitis, cystic fibrosis, chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, or Meckel\u2019s diverticulum). There have been reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures or risk of strictures, such as previous GI surgery, in association with the ingestion of drugs in nondeformable extended-release formulations. It is possible that hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be visible on abdominal x-rays under certain circumstances, especially when digital enhancing techniques are utilized. The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.12 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. 5.13 Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.14 Sulfites Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablet contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may impair the mental and/or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and know how they will react to the medication [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]."

Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets was administered to a total of 2,524 patients in 15 controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies. Of these, 423 patients were exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for greater than 6 months and 141 exposed for greater than one year. The most common adverse reactions leading to study discontinuation were nausea, vomiting, constipation, somnolence, and dizziness. The most common treatment-related serious adverse reactions from controlled and uncontrolled chronic pain studies were drug withdrawal syndrome, overdose, confusional state, and constipation. The overall incidence of adverse reactions in patients greater than 65 years of age was higher, with a greater than 5% difference in rates for constipation and nausea when compared with younger patients. The overall incidence of adverse reactions in female patients was higher, with a greater than 5% difference in rates for nausea, vomiting, constipation and somnolence when compared with male patients. A 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study was conducted in opioid tolerant patients with moderate to severe low back pain [see Clinical Studies (14)] . A total of 447 patients were enrolled into the open-label titration phase with 268 patients randomized into the double-blind treatment phase. The adverse reactions that were reported in at least 2% of the patients are contained in Table 2. Table 2.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylactic reaction has been reported with ingredients contained in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Hyperalgesia and Allodynia : Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Hypoglycemia : Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor (e.g., diabetes)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4 includes clinically significant drug interactions with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Table 4: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose. Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Intervention: The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)] . Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Intervention: Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs for diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs : Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. (7) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) : Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. (7) Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics : Avoid use with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets because they may reduce analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm. (8.1) Lactation : Not recommended. (8.2) Severe Hepatic Impairment : Use not recommended. (8.6) Severe Renal Impairment : Consider an alternate analgesic. (8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, developmental delays, and altered behavioral responses were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 2.1 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 4.8 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 2.3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 2.1 or 17 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when use of shorter-acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1.75, 3.5, or 7 mg/kg/day (0.5, 1.1, or 2.1 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 20 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (4.3, 8.5, or 17 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the highest dose group (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (4.8 to 65.4 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (3.5 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.1, 2.3, or 4.6 times the human daily dose of 32 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 2.3 times the human dose of 32 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to Lactation Day 21 via oral gavage doses of 1.75, 3.5, or 7 mg/kg/day (0.5, 1.1, or 2.1 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Reduced pup weights were noted at 1.1 and 2.1 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day and increased pup deaths, delayed ear opening, reduced auditory startle reflex, and reduced open-field activity were also noted at 2.1 times the HDD. Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in all groups) and decreased maternal care in the high dose group. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Low concentrations of hydromorphone have been detected in human milk in clinical trials. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfeeding infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped. Nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets since hydromorphone is excreted in the milk. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients 17 years of age and younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment In a study that used a single 4 mg oral dose of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets, four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-\u221e ) were observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Group B). Start patients with moderate hepatic impairment on 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be used in patients with normal hepatic function. Closely monitor patients with moderate hepatic impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients have not been studied. As further increases in C max and AUC 0-\u221e of hydromorphone in this group are expected, use of alternate analgesics is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. 8.7 Renal Impairment Administration of a single 4 mg dose of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets resulted in two-fold and four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48h ) in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) impairment, respectively. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with moderate renal impairment on 50% and patients with severe renal impairment on 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal renal function. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only intended for once daily administration, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing interval in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]."

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contains hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contains hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in combination with other abused drugs. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is approved for oral use only. Inappropriate intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, increased risk of endocarditis, and valvular heart injury, and embolism. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), and Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

      "9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contains hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in combination with other abused drugs. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is approved for oral use only. Inappropriate intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, increased risk of endocarditis, and valvular heart injury, and embolism. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV."

    "dependence": [
      "9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Because the duration of reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets will continue to release hydromorphone and add to the hydromorphone load for up to 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion, necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone, a semi-synthetic morphine derivative, is a hydrogenated ketone of morphine. Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics CNS Depressant/Alcohol Interaction Additive pharmacodynamic effects may be expected when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, legal or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression. Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces dose-related respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis, rather than miosis, may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Release of histamine may be induced by hydromorphone and can contribute to opioid-induced hypotension. Manifestations of histamine release or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration-Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), (2.4)]. Concentration-Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), (2.3), (2.4)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are an extended-release formulation of hydromorphone that produces a gradual increase in hydromorphone concentrations. Following a single-dose administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, plasma concentrations gradually increase over 6 to 8 hours, and thereafter concentrations are sustained for approximately 18 to 24 hours post-dose. The median T max values ranged from 12 to 16 hours. The mean half-life was approximately 11 hours, ranging from 8 to 15 hours in most individual subjects. Linear pharmacokinetics has been demonstrated for hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets over the dose range 8 to 64 mg, with a dose-proportional increase in C max and overall exposure (AUC 0-\u221e ) ( see Table 5 ). Steady-state plasma concentrations are approximately twice those observed following the first dose, and steady state is reached after 3 to 4 days of once-daily dosing of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. At steady state, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets given once daily maintained hydromorphone plasma concentrations within the same concentration range as the immediate-release tablet given 4 times daily at the same total daily dose and diminished the fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations seen with the immediate-release tablet ( see Figure 1 ). The bioavailability of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily and immediate-release hydromorphone four times daily in adults is comparable, as presented in Table 5 . Figure 1. Mean Steady-State Plasma Concentration Profile Table 5. Mean (\u00b1SD) Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Pharmacokinetic Parameters Food Effect The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not affected by food as indicated by bioequivalence when administered under fed and fasting conditions. Therefore, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be administered without regard to meals. When a 16 mg dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets was administered to healthy volunteers immediately following a high-fat meal, the median time to C max (T max ) was minimally affected by the high-fat meal occurring at 16 hours compared to 18 hours while fasting. Distribution Following intravenous administration of hydromorphone to healthy volunteers, the mean volume of distribution was 2.9 (\u00b11.3) L/kg, suggesting extensive tissue distribution. The mean extent of binding of hydromorphone to human plasma proteins was determined to be 27% in an in vitro study. Elimination Metabolism After oral administration of an immediate-release formulation, hydromorphone undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and is metabolized primarily in the liver by glucuronidation to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide, which follows a similar time course to hydromorphone in plasma. Exposure to the glucuronide metabolite is 35 to 40 times higher than exposure to the parent drug. In vitro data suggest that hydromorphone in clinically relevant concentrations has minimal potential to inhibit the activity of human hepatic CYP450 enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, and 4A11. Excretion Approximately 75% of the administered dose is excreted in urine. Most of the administered hydromorphone dose is excreted as metabolites. Approximately 7% and 1% of the dose are excreted as unchanged hydromorphone in urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Patients Population PK analysis performed on plasma concentration data from 407 osteoarthritis (OA) patients using hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets showed an average 11% increase in hydromorphone AUC in the elderly group (65 to 75 years of age) when compared to the younger age group (less than or equal to 65 years of age). Sex Females appeared to have approximately 10% higher mean systemic exposure in terms of C max and AUC values. Hepatic Impairment In a study that used a single 4 mg oral dose of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets, four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-\u221e ) were observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Group B). Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC 0-\u221e of hydromorphone in this group is expected. Start patients with moderate hepatic impairment on 25% of the usual dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and closely monitor for respiratory and central nervous system depression during dose titration. Consider alternate analgesic therapy for patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Specific Populations (8.6)] . Renal Impairment Renal impairment affected the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone and its metabolites following administration of a single 4 mg dose of immediate-release tablets. The effects of renal impairment on hydromorphone pharmacokinetics were two-fold and four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48h ) in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) impairment, respectively. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to subjects with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with moderate renal impairment on 50% of the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose for patients with normal renal function and closely monitor for respiratory and central nervous system depression during dose titration. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is only intended for once-daily administration, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing interval in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] . Drug Interaction Studies Alcohol Interaction An in vivo study examined the effect of alcohol (40%, 20%, 4% and 0%) on the bioavailability of a single dose of 16 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in healthy, fasted or fed volunteers. The results showed that the hydromorphone mean AUC 0-\u221e was 5% higher and 4% lower (not statistically significant) in the fasted and fed groups respectively after co-administration of 240 mL of 40% alcohol. The AUC 0-\u221e was similarly unaffected in subjects following the co-administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and alcohol (240 mL of 20% or 4% alcohol). The change in geometric mean C max with concomitant administration of alcohol and hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets ranged from an increase of 10% to 31% across all conditions studied. The change in mean C max was greater in the fasted group of subjects. Following concomitant administration of 240 mL of 40% alcohol while fasting, the mean C max increased by 37% and up to 151% in an individual subject. Following the concomitant administration of 240 mL of 20% alcohol while fasting, the mean C max increased by 35% and up to 139% in an individual subject. Following the concomitant administration of 240 mL of 4% alcohol while fasting, the mean C max increased by 19% on average and as much as 73% for an individual subject. The range of median T max for the fed and fasted treatments with 4%, 20% and 40% alcohol was 12 to 16 hours compared to 16 hours for the 0% alcohol treatments. Fig-1 Table-5"

Hydromorphone HCl was administered to Han-Wistar rats (2, 5, and 15 mg/kg/day for males, and 8, 25 and 75 mg/kg/day for females) for 2 years by oral gavage. In female rats, incidences of hibernoma (tumor of brown fat) were increased at 10.5 times the maximum recommended daily exposure based on AUC at the mid dose (2 tumor, 25 mg/kg/day) and 53.7 times the maximum recommended human daily exposure based on AUC at the maximum dose (4 tumors, 75 mg/kg/day).

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hydromorphone hydrochloride were completed in both Han-Wistar rats and Crl:CD1 \u00ae (ICR) mice. Hydromorphone HCl was administered to Han-Wistar rats (2, 5, and 15 mg/kg/day for males, and 8, 25 and 75 mg/kg/day for females) for 2 years by oral gavage. In female rats, incidences of hibernoma (tumor of brown fat) were increased at 10.5 times the maximum recommended daily exposure based on AUC at the mid dose (2 tumor, 25 mg/kg/day) and 53.7 times the maximum recommended human daily exposure based on AUC at the maximum dose (4 tumors, 75 mg/kg/day).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets was investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study in opioid tolerant patients with moderate-to-severe low back pain. Patients were considered opioid tolerant if they were currently on opioid therapy that was \u2265 60 mg/day of oral morphine equivalent for at least 2 months prior to screening. Patients entered an open-label conversion and titration phase with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, were converted to a starting dose that was approximately 75% of their total daily morphine equivalent dose, and were dosed once daily until adequate pain control was achieved while exhibiting tolerable side effects. Supplemental immediate-release hydromorphone tablets were allowed throughout the study. Patients who achieved a stable dose entered a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized treatment phase. Mean daily dose at randomization was 37.8 mg/day (range of 12 mg/day to 64 mg/day). Fifty-eight (58) percent of patients were successfully titrated to a stable dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets during the open-label conversion and titration phase. During the double-blind treatment phase, patients randomized to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets continued with the stable dose achieved in the conversion and titration phase of the study. Patients randomized to placebo received, in a blinded manner, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and matching placebo in doses tapering from the stable dose achieved in conversion and titration. During the taper down period, patients were allowed immediate-release hydromorphone tablets as supplemental analgesia to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms in placebo patients. After the taper period, the number of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets was limited to two tablets per day. Forty-nine (49) percent of patients treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 33% of patients treated with placebo completed the 12-week treatment period. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets provided superior analgesia compared to placebo. There was a significant difference between the mean changes from Baseline to Week 12 or Final Visit in average weekly pain intensity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores obtained from patient diaries between the two groups. The proportion of patients with various degrees of improvement from screening to Week 12 or Final Visit is shown in Figure 2 . For this analysis, patients who discontinued treatment for any reason prior to Week 12 were assigned a value of zero improvement. Figure 2.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] , reserve hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]: \u2022 Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated, \u2022 Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories contain hydromorphone, an opioid agonist, and are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. (1) Limitations of Use (1) Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses, reserve hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]: \u2022 Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated, \u2022 Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia"
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. \u2022 Individualize dosing based on the severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. (2.1) \u2022 Usual adult dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories is 1 suppository every 6 to 8 hours. (2.2) \u2022 Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in a physically-dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. (2.4) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are available in one strength: 3 mg. \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . \u2022 Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . \u2022 Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories and adjust the dosage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 2.2 Dosing Initiating Treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Suppositories Initiate treatment with 1 hydromorphone hydrochloride suppository every 6 to 8 hours. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Suppositories There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. Conversion from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Suppositories to Extended-Release Hydromorphone Hydrochloride The relative bioavailability of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories compared to extended-release hydromorphone hydrochloride is unknown, so conversion to extended-release tablets must be accompanied by close observation for signs of excessive sedation and respiratory depression. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. For chronic pain, doses should be administered around-the-clock. A supplemental dose of 5 to 15% of the total daily usage may be administered every two hours on an as-needed basis. 2.6 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Suppositories Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid dependent patient taking hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. (5.5) \u2022 Adrenal Insufficiency : If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. (5.6) \u2022 Severe Hypotension : Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in patients with circulatory shock. (5.7) \u2022 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. (5.8) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )] . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, and monitor all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are essential [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ]. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . 5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] 5.5 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease : Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories and when hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.6 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.7 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. In patients with circulatory shock hydromorphone hydrochloride may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in patients with circulatory shock. 5.8 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.10 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories therapy. 5.11 Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] . Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.12 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories and know how they will react to the medication. 5.13 Sulfites Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sulfite-containing medications."

Serious adverse reactions associated with hydromorphone hydrochloride include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Less Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations Eye disorders: vision blurred, diplopia, miosis, visual impairment Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, ileus, diarrhea, abdominal pain General disorders and administration site conditions: weakness, feeling abnormal, chills Hepatobiliary disorders: biliary colic Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle rigidity Nervous system disorders: headache, tremor, paraesthesia, nystagmus, increased intracranial pressure, syncope, taste alteration, involuntary muscle contractions, presyncope Psychiatric disorders: agitation, mood altered, nervousness, anxiety, depression, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia, abnormal dreams Renal and urinary disorders: urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: bronchospasm, laryngospasm Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria, rash, hyperhidrosis Vascular disorders: flushing, hypotension, hypertension 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of hydromorphone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Confusional state, convulsions, drowsiness, dyskinesia, dyspnea, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, hepatic enzymes increased, hyperalgesia, hypersensitivity reaction, lethargy, myoclonus, oropharyngeal swelling, peripheral edema, and somnolence. Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] ."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with hydromorphone hydrochloride. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine, Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. \u2022 Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories if serotonin syndrome is suspected. (7) \u2022 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. (7) \u2022 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories because they may reduce analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. (8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . There are no available data with hydromorphone hydrochloride in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of hydromorphone hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories contain hydromorphone, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, morphine, oxymorphone and tapentadol. Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. Hydromorphone hydrochloride, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories are for rectal use only. Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] ."

When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride suppositories, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.5 )] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.5 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of hydromorphone hydrochloride is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-24 ) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the hydromorphone hydrochloride 8 mg tablet and an equivalent dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution has been demonstrated. After oral administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1-hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T\u00bd (hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) 8 mg Oral Liquid 5.7 (31%) 0.73 (71%) 24.6 (29%) 2.8 (20%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered C max by 25%, prolonged T max by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8-19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC \u221e ) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone ( C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 - 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

      "WARNING: SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING RISKS FROM USE OF HYDROMORPHONE HYDROCHLORIDE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Because the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death, assess each patient\u2019s risk prior to prescribing and reassess all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially during initiation or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are essential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Accidental Ingestion Accidental ingestion of even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of hydromorphone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7)]. Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS) Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. Ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to complete a REMS-compliant education program and to counsel patients and caregivers on serious risks, safe use, and the importance of reading the Medication Guide with each prescription [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. WARNING: SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING RISKS FROM USE OF HYDROMORPHONE HYDROCHLORIDE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess patient\u2019s risk before prescribing, and monitor regularly for these behaviors and conditions. (5.1) Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets whole to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal dose of hydromorphone. (5.2) Accidental ingestion of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially by children, can result in fatal overdose of hydromorphone. (5.2) Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required; and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. (5.3, 7) Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. Ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery. (5.4) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products.

(1) Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic. (1)"
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. (2.1) For once daily administration IN OPIOID-TOLERANT PATIENTS. (2.1) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. (2.1, 5) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse (5.1) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments (2.1, 5.2) Instruct patients to swallow hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets intact, and not to cut, break, chew, crush, or dissolve the tablets (risk of potentially fatal overdose). (2.1, 5.1) Discuss opioid overdose reversal agents and options for acquiring them with the patient and/or caregiver, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially if the patient has additional risk factors for overdose, or close contacts at risk for exposure and overdose. (2.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3). Dose may be increased using increments of 4 to 8 mg every 3 to 4 days as needed to achieve adequate analgesia. (2.4) Periodically reassess patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to evaluate the continued need for opioid analgesics to maintain pain control, for the signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse. (2.4) Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a physically-dependent patient because rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. (2.5, 5.13) Moderate Hepatic Impairment: Initiate treatment with 25% of the dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal hepatic function. Monitor closely for respiratory and central nervous system depression. (2.6) Moderate and Severe Renal Impairment: Initiate treatment in patients with moderate renal impairment with 50% and patients with severe renal impairment with 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal renal function. Monitor closely for respiratory and central nervous system depression. (2.7) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions To avoid medication errors, prescribers and pharmacists must be aware that hydromorphone is available as both immediate-release 8 mg tablets and extended-release 8 mg tablets. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Due to the risk of respiratory depression, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only indicated for use in patients who are already opioid-tolerant. Discontinue or taper all other extended-release opioids when beginning hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only for use in opioid-tolerant patients, do not begin any patient on hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets as the first opioid. Patients who are opioid-tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg of oral morphine per day, at least 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone per day, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per day, at least 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, at least 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Instruct patients to swallow hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets whole [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Crushing, chewing, or dissolving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of hydromorphone and can lead to overdose or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 2.2 Patient Access to an Opioid Overdose Reversal Agent for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Inform patients and caregivers about opioid overdose reversal agents (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene). Discuss the importance of having access to an opioid overdose reversal agent, especially if the patient has risk factors for overdose (e.g., concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose) or if there are household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the management of pain in any patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)] . Discuss the options for obtaining an opioid overdose reversal agent (e.g., prescription, over-the-counter, or as part of a community-based program) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . There are important differences among the opioid overdose reversal agents, such as route of administration, product strength, approved patient age range, and pharmacokinetics. Be familiar with these differences, as outlined in the approved labeling for those products, prior to recommending or prescribing such an agent. 2.3 Initial Dosage Conversion from other oral opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets When hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate. There is substantial inter-patient variability in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour oral hydromorphone dosage and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral hydromorphone dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. In an hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets clinical trial with an open-label titration period, patients were converted from their prior opioid to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets using the Table 1 as a guide for the initial hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose. The recommended starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are 50% of the calculated estimate of daily hydromorphone requirement. Calculate the estimated daily hydromorphone requirement using Table 1. Consider the following when using the information in Table 1: This is not a table of equianalgesic doses. The conversion factors in this table are only for the conversion from one of the listed oral opioid analgesics to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. The table cannot be used to convert from hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to another opioid. Doing so will result in an overestimation of the dose of the new opioid and may result in fatal overdose. Table 1. Conversion Factors to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Prior Oral Opioid Approximate Oral Conversion Factor Hydromorphone 1 Codeine 0.06 Hydrocodone 0.4 Methadone 0.6 Morphine 0.2 Oxycodone 0.4 Oxymorphone 0.6 To calculate the estimated hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose using Table 1 : For patients on a single opioid, sum the current total daily dose of the opioid and then multiply the total daily dose by the conversion factor to calculate the approximate oral hydromorphone daily dose. For patients on a regimen of more than one opioid, calculate the approximate oral hydromorphone dose for each opioid and sum the totals to obtain the approximate total hydromorphone daily dose. For patients on a regimen of fixed-ratio opioid/non-opioid analgesic products, use only the opioid component of these products in the conversion. Always round the dose down, if necessary, to the appropriate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets strength(s) available. Example conversion from a single opioid to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets: Step 1: Sum the total daily dose of the opioid 30 mg of oxycodone 2 times daily = 60 mg total daily dose of oxycodone Step 2: Calculate the approximate equivalent dose of oral hydromorphone based on the total daily dose of the current opioid using Table 1 60 mg total daily dose of oxycodone x Conversion Factor of 0.4 = 24 mg of oral hydromorphone daily Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to be given every 24 hours, which is 50% of the calculated oral hydromorphone dose. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablet strengths available. 50% of 24 mg results in an initial dose of 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily Adjust individually for each patient Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal or for signs of over-sedation/toxicity after converting patients to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets treatment can be initiated. To calculate the 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose, use a conversion factor of 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal patch to 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Then reduce the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose by 50%. For example: Step 1: Identify the dose of transdermal fentanyl. 75 mg of transdermal fentanyl Step 2: Use the conversion factor of 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal patch to 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 75 mg of transdermal fentanyl: 36 mg total daily dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to be given every 24 hours, which is 50% of the converted dose. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablet strengths available. 50% of 36 mg results in an initial dose of 18 mg, which would be rounded down to 16 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily Adjust individually for each patient Conversion from Methadone to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma. 2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.13)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During use of opioid therapy for an extended period of time, periodically reassess the continued need for use of opioid analgesics. Plasma levels of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are sustained for 18 to 24 hours. Dosage adjustments of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be made in increments of 4 to 8 mg every 3 to 4 days as needed to achieve adequate analgesia. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dose increase of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.5 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. 2.6 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Moderate Hepatic Impairment Start patients with moderate hepatic impairment on 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal hepatic function. Closely monitor patients with moderate hepatic impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. Use of alternate analgesics is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 2.7 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Start patients with moderate renal impairment on 50% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal renal function. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only intended for once daily administration, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing interval in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) and Allodynia : Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation. (5.6) Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or Elderly Cachectic Debilitated Patients: Regularly evaluate closely, particularly during initiation and titration. (5.7) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. (5.8) Severe Hypotension: Regularly evaluate during dose initiation and titration. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with circulatory shock. (5.9) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. (5.10) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contains hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)] . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. The risk of opioid-related overdose or overdose-related death is increased with higher opioid doses, and this risk persists over the course of therapy. In postmarketing studies, addiction, abuse, misuse, and fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose were observed in patients with long-term opioid use [see Postmarketing Experience (6.2)] . Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, and reassess all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Abuse or misuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of hydromorphone and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)] . Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and proper disposal of unused drug . Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modified-release opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage (10)] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . Patient Access to an Opioid Overdose Reversal Agent for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Inform patients and caregivers about opioid overdose reversal agents (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene). Discuss the importance of having access to an opioid overdose reversal agent, especially if the patient has risk factors for overdose (e.g., concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose) or if there are household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the management of pain in any patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)] . Discuss the options for obtaining an opioid overdose reversal agent (e.g., prescription, over-the-counter, or as part of a community-based program). There are important differences among the opioid overdose reversal agents, such as route of administration, product strength, approved patient age range, and pharmacokinetics. Be familiar with these differences, as outlined in the approved labeling for those products, prior to recommending or prescribing such an agent. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression, and how to use an opioid overdose reversal agent for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose. Emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if an opioid overdose reversal agent is administered [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3), Overdosage (10)]. 5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17)] . 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.5 Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG. Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com. The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint. 5.6 Opioid Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3)]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5); Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. 5.7 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5), Drug Interactions (7)]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.9 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.11 Risks of Gastrointestinal Complications Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with other GI obstruction. Because the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablet is nondeformable and does not appreciably change in shape in the GI tract, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic, for example: esophageal motility disorders, small bowel inflammatory disease, \u201cshort gut\u201d syndrome due to adhesions or decreased transit time, past history of peritonitis, cystic fibrosis, chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, or Meckel\u2019s diverticulum). There have been reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures or risk of strictures, such as previous GI surgery, in association with the ingestion of drugs in nondeformable extended-release formulations. It is possible that hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be visible on abdominal x-rays under certain circumstances, especially when digital enhancing techniques are utilized. The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Cases of opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED) have been reported in patients taking opioids. The risk of OIED may increase as the dose and/or duration of opioids increases. Regularly evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of OIED (e.g., dysphagia, regurgitation, non-cardiac chest pain), and if necessary, adjust opioid therapy as clinically appropriate. 5.12 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. 5.13 Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.14 Sulfites Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablet contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may impair the mental and/or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and know how they will react to the medication [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]."

Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets was administered to a total of 2,524 patients in 15 controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies. Of these, 423 patients were exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for greater than 6 months and 141 exposed for greater than one year. The most common adverse reactions leading to study discontinuation were nausea, vomiting, constipation, somnolence, and dizziness. The most common treatment-related serious adverse reactions from controlled and uncontrolled chronic pain studies were drug withdrawal syndrome, overdose, confusional state, and constipation. The overall incidence of adverse reactions in patients greater than 65 years of age was higher, with a greater than 5% difference in rates for constipation and nausea when compared with younger patients. The overall incidence of adverse reactions in female patients was higher, with a greater than 5% difference in rates for nausea, vomiting, constipation and somnolence when compared with male patients. A 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study was conducted in opioid tolerant patients with moderate to severe low back pain [see Clinical Studies (14)] . A total of 447 patients were enrolled into the open-label titration phase with 268 patients randomized into the double-blind treatment phase. The adverse reactions that were reported in at least 2% of the patients are contained in Table 2. Table 2.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylactic reaction has been reported with ingredients contained in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Hyperalgesia and Allodynia : Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Hypoglycemia : Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor (e.g., diabetes). Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED) : Cases of OIED have been reported in patients taking opioids, and may occur more frequently in patients taking higher doses of opioid, and/or in patients taking opioids longer term [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. Adverse Reactions from Observational Studies A prospective, observational cohort study estimated the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse in patients initiating long-term use of Schedule II opioid analgesics between 2017 and 2021. Study participants included in one or more analyses had been enrolled in selected insurance plans or health systems for at least one year, were free of at least one outcome at baseline, completed a minimum number of follow-up assessments, and either: 1) filled multiple extended-release/long-acting opioid analgesic prescriptions during a 90 day period (n=978); or 2) filled any Schedule II opioid analgesic for at least 70 of 90 days (n=1,244). Those included also had no dispensing of the qualifying opioids in the previous 6 months. Over 12 months: approximately 1% to 6% of participants across the two cohorts newly met criteria for addiction, as assessed with two validated interview based measures of moderate-to-severe opioid use disorder based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria, and approximately 9% and 22% of participants across the two cohorts newly met criteria for prescription opioid abuse and misuse [defined in Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)], respectively, as measured with a validated self-reported instrument. A retrospective, observational cohort study estimated the risk of opioid involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death in patients with new long-term use of Schedule II opioid analgesics from 2006 through 2016 (n=220,249). Included patients had been enrolled in either one of two commercial insurance programs, one managed care program, or one Medicaid program for at least 9 months. New long-term use was defined as having Schedule II opioid analgesic prescriptions covering at least 70 days\u2019 supply over the 3 months prior to study entry and none during the preceding 6 months. Patients were excluded if they had an opioid-involved overdose in the 9 months prior to study entry. Overdose was measured using a validated medical code-based algorithm with linkage to the National Death Index database. The 5-year cumulative incidence estimates for opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death ranged from approximately 1.5% to 4% across study sites, counting only the first event during follow-up. Approximately 17% of first opioid overdoses observed over the entire study period (5-11 years, depending on the study site) were fatal. Higher baseline opioid dose was the strongest and most consistent predictor of opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death. Study exclusion criteria may have selected patients at lower risk of overdose, and substantial loss to follow-up (approximately 80%) also may have biased estimates. The risk estimates from the studies described above may not be generalizable to all patients receiving opioid analgesics, such as those with exposures shorter or longer than the duration evaluated in the studies."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4 includes clinically significant drug interactions with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Table 4: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent. Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Intervention: The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)] . Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Intervention: Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs for diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs : Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. (7) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) : Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. (7) Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics : Avoid use with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets because they may reduce analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm. (8.1) Lactation : Not recommended. (8.2) Severe Hepatic Impairment : Use not recommended. (8.6) Severe Renal Impairment : Consider an alternate analgesic. (8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, developmental delays, and altered behavioral responses were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 2.1 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 4.8 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 2.3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 2.1 or 17 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid overdose reversal agent, such as naloxone or nalmefene, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when use of shorter-acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1.75, 3.5, or 7 mg/kg/day (0.5, 1.1, or 2.1 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 20 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (4.3, 8.5, or 17 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the highest dose group (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (4.8 to 65.4 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (3.5 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.1, 2.3, or 4.6 times the human daily dose of 32 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 2.3 times the human dose of 32 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to Lactation Day 21 via oral gavage doses of 1.75, 3.5, or 7 mg/kg/day (0.5, 1.1, or 2.1 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Reduced pup weights were noted at 1.1 and 2.1 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day and increased pup deaths, delayed ear opening, reduced auditory startle reflex, and reduced open-field activity were also noted at 2.1 times the HDD. Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in all groups) and decreased maternal care in the high dose group. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Low concentrations of hydromorphone have been detected in human milk in clinical trials. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfeeding infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped. Nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets since hydromorphone is excreted in the milk. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients 17 years of age and younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment In a study that used a single 4 mg oral dose of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets, four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-\u221e ) were observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Group B). Start patients with moderate hepatic impairment on 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be used in patients with normal hepatic function. Closely monitor patients with moderate hepatic impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients have not been studied. As further increases in C max and AUC 0-\u221e of hydromorphone in this group are expected, use of alternate analgesics is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Administration of a single 4 mg dose of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets resulted in two-fold and four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48h ) in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) impairment, respectively. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with moderate renal impairment on 50% and patients with severe renal impairment on 25% of the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose that would be prescribed for patients with normal renal function. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression during initiation of therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and during dose titration. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are only intended for once daily administration, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing interval in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)] ."

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, developmental delays, and altered behavioral responses were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 2.1 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 4.8 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 2.3 times the HDD to pregnant mice.

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contains hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contains hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in combination with other abused drugs. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is approved for oral use only. Inappropriate intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, increased risk of endocarditis, and valvular heart injury, and embolism. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), and Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations. Toxic leukoencephalopathy has been reported after opioid overdose and can present hours, days, or weeks after apparent recovery from the initial intoxication. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid overdose reversal agent such as naloxone or nalmefene. Because the duration of reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets will continue to release hydromorphone and add to the hydromorphone load for up to 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion, necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone, a semi-synthetic morphine derivative, is a hydrogenated ketone of morphine. Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics CNS Depressant/Alcohol Interaction Additive pharmacodynamic effects may be expected when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, legal or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression. Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces dose-related respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis, rather than miosis, may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, transient elevations in serum amylase, and opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED). Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Release of histamine may be induced by hydromorphone and can contribute to opioid-induced hypotension. Manifestations of histamine release or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration-Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), (2.4)] . Concentration-Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), (2.3), (2.4)] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are an extended-release formulation of hydromorphone that produces a gradual increase in hydromorphone concentrations. Following a single-dose administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, plasma concentrations gradually increase over 6 to 8 hours, and thereafter concentrations are sustained for approximately 18 to 24 hours post-dose. The median T max values ranged from 12 to 16 hours. The mean half-life was approximately 11 hours, ranging from 8 to 15 hours in most individual subjects. Linear pharmacokinetics has been demonstrated for hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets over the dose range 8 to 64 mg, with a dose-proportional increase in C max and overall exposure (AUC 0-\u221e ) ( see Table 5 ). Steady-state plasma concentrations are approximately twice those observed following the first dose, and steady state is reached after 3 to 4 days of once-daily dosing of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. At steady state, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets given once daily maintained hydromorphone plasma concentrations within the same concentration range as the immediate-release tablet given 4 times daily at the same total daily dose and diminished the fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations seen with the immediate-release tablet ( see Figure 1 ). The bioavailability of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily and immediate-release hydromorphone four times daily in adults is comparable, as presented in Table 5 . Figure 1. Mean Steady-State Plasma Concentration Profile Table 5. Mean (\u00b1SD) Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Pharmacokinetic Parameters Food Effect The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not affected by food as indicated by bioequivalence when administered under fed and fasting conditions. Therefore, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be administered without regard to meals. When a 16 mg dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets was administered to healthy volunteers immediately following a high-fat meal, the median time to C max (T max ) was minimally affected by the high-fat meal occurring at 16 hours compared to 18 hours while fasting. Distribution Following intravenous administration of hydromorphone to healthy volunteers, the mean volume of distribution was 2.9 (\u00b11.3) L/kg, suggesting extensive tissue distribution. The mean extent of binding of hydromorphone to human plasma proteins was determined to be 27% in an in vitro study. Elimination Metabolism After oral administration of an immediate-release formulation, hydromorphone undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and is metabolized primarily in the liver by glucuronidation to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide, which follows a similar time course to hydromorphone in plasma. Exposure to the glucuronide metabolite is 35 to 40 times higher than exposure to the parent drug. In vitro data suggest that hydromorphone in clinically relevant concentrations has minimal potential to inhibit the activity of human hepatic CYP450 enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, and 4A11. Excretion Approximately 75% of the administered dose is excreted in urine. Most of the administered hydromorphone dose is excreted as metabolites. Approximately 7% and 1% of the dose are excreted as unchanged hydromorphone in urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Patients Population PK analysis performed on plasma concentration data from 407 osteoarthritis (OA) patients using hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets showed an average 11% increase in hydromorphone AUC in the elderly group (65 to 75 years of age) when compared to the younger age group (less than or equal to 65 years of age). Sex Females appeared to have approximately 10% higher mean systemic exposure in terms of C max and AUC values. Hepatic Impairment In a study that used a single 4 mg oral dose of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets, four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-\u221e ) were observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Group B). Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC 0-\u221e of hydromorphone in this group is expected. Start patients with moderate hepatic impairment on 25% of the usual dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and closely monitor for respiratory and central nervous system depression during dose titration. Consider alternate analgesic therapy for patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Specific Populations (8.6)] . Renal Impairment Renal impairment affected the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone and its metabolites following administration of a single 4 mg dose of immediate-release tablets. The effects of renal impairment on hydromorphone pharmacokinetics were two-fold and four-fold increases in plasma levels of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48h ) in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) impairment, respectively. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to subjects with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with moderate renal impairment on 50% of the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose for patients with normal renal function and closely monitor for respiratory and central nervous system depression during dose titration. As hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is only intended for once-daily administration, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing interval in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] . Drug Interaction Studies Alcohol Interaction An in vivo study examined the effect of alcohol (40%, 20%, 4% and 0%) on the bioavailability of a single dose of 16 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in healthy, fasted or fed volunteers. The results showed that the hydromorphone mean AUC 0-\u221e was 5% higher and 4% lower (not statistically significant) in the fasted and fed groups respectively after co-administration of 240 mL of 40% alcohol. The AUC 0-\u221e was similarly unaffected in subjects following the co-administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and alcohol (240 mL of 20% or 4% alcohol). The change in geometric mean C max with concomitant administration of alcohol and hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets ranged from an increase of 10% to 31% across all conditions studied. The change in mean C max was greater in the fasted group of subjects. Following concomitant administration of 240 mL of 40% alcohol while fasting, the mean C max increased by 37% and up to 151% in an individual subject. Following the concomitant administration of 240 mL of 20% alcohol while fasting, the mean C max increased by 35% and up to 139% in an individual subject. Following the concomitant administration of 240 mL of 4% alcohol while fasting, the mean C max increased by 19% on average and as much as 73% for an individual subject. The range of median T max for the fed and fasted treatments with 4%, 20% and 40% alcohol was 12 to 16 hours compared to 16 hours for the 0% alcohol treatments. Fig-1 Table-5"

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone, a semi-synthetic morphine derivative, is a hydrogenated ketone of morphine. Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics CNS Depressant/Alcohol Interaction Additive pharmacodynamic effects may be expected when hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, legal or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression. Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces dose-related respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis, rather than miosis, may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, transient elevations in serum amylase, and opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED). Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Release of histamine may be induced by hydromorphone and can contribute to opioid-induced hypotension. Manifestations of histamine release or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility.

Hydromorphone HCl was administered to Han-Wistar rats (2, 5, and 15 mg/kg/day for males, and 8, 25 and 75 mg/kg/day for females) for 2 years by oral gavage. In female rats, incidences of hibernoma (tumor of brown fat) were increased at 10.5 times the maximum recommended daily exposure based on AUC at the mid dose (2 tumor, 25 mg/kg/day) and 53.7 times the maximum recommended human daily exposure based on AUC at the maximum dose (4 tumors, 75 mg/kg/day). The clinical relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in male rats. The systemic drug exposure (AUC, ng\u2022h/mL) at the 15 mg/kg/day in male rats was 7.6 times greater than the human exposure at a single dose of 32 mg/day of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets was investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study in opioid tolerant patients with moderate-to-severe low back pain. Patients were considered opioid tolerant if they were currently on opioid therapy that was \u2265 60 mg/day of oral morphine equivalent for at least 2 months prior to screening. Patients entered an open-label conversion and titration phase with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, were converted to a starting dose that was approximately 75% of their total daily morphine equivalent dose, and were dosed once daily until adequate pain control was achieved while exhibiting tolerable side effects. Supplemental immediate-release hydromorphone tablets were allowed throughout the study. Patients who achieved a stable dose entered a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized treatment phase. Mean daily dose at randomization was 37.8 mg/day (range of 12 mg/day to 64 mg/day). Fifty-eight (58) percent of patients were successfully titrated to a stable dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets during the open-label conversion and titration phase. During the double-blind treatment phase, patients randomized to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets continued with the stable dose achieved in the conversion and titration phase of the study. Patients randomized to placebo received, in a blinded manner, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and matching placebo in doses tapering from the stable dose achieved in conversion and titration. During the taper down period, patients were allowed immediate-release hydromorphone tablets as supplemental analgesia to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms in placebo patients. After the taper period, the number of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets was limited to two tablets per day. Forty-nine (49) percent of patients treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 33% of patients treated with placebo completed the 12-week treatment period. Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets provided superior analgesia compared to placebo. There was a significant difference between the mean changes from Baseline to Week 12 or Final Visit in average weekly pain intensity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores obtained from patient diaries between the two groups. The proportion of patients with various degrees of improvement from screening to Week 12 or Final Visit is shown in Figure 2 .

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Storage and Disposal Because of the risks associated with accidental ingestion, misuse, and abuse, advise patients to store hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets securely, out of sight and reach of children, and in a location not accessible by others, including visitors to the home. Inform patients that leaving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets unsecured can pose a deadly risk to others in the home [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.5), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)] . Advise patients and caregivers that when medicines are no longer needed, they should be disposed of promptly. Expired, unwanted, or unused hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be disposed of by flushing the unused medication down the toilet if a drug take-back option is not readily available. Inform patients that they can visit www.fda.gov/drugdisposal for a complete list of medicines recommended for disposal by flushing, as well as additional information on disposal of unused medicines. Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Inform patients that the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Instruct patients not to share hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with others and to take steps to protect hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets from theft or misuse. Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression, including information that the risk is greatest when starting hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets or when the dose is increased, and that it can occur even at recommended dosages. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Accidental Ingestion Inform patients that accidental ingestion, especially by children, may result in respiratory depression or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Interactions with Benzodiazepines and Other CNS Depressants Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, and not to use these concomitantly unless supervised by a health care provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7)] . Patient Access to an Opioid Overdose Reversal Agent for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Inform patients and caregivers about opioid overdose reversal agents (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene). Discuss the importance of having access to an opioid overdose reversal agent, especially if the patient has risk factors for overdose (e.g., concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose) or if there are household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. Discuss with the patient the options for obtaining an opioid overdose reversal agent (e.g., prescription, over-the-counter, or as part of a community-based program) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose. Explain to patients and caregivers that effects of opioid overdose reversal agents like naloxone and nalmefene are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if an opioid overdose reversal agent is administered [see Overdosage (10)]. Advise patients and caregivers: how to treat with the overdose reversal agent in the event of an opioid overdose to tell family and friends about their opioid overdose reversal agent, and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency to read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their opioid overdose reversal agent. Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do. Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Inform patients and caregivers not to increase opioid dosage without first consulting a clinician. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of hyperalgesia, including worsening pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6); Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Important Administration Instructions Instruct patients how to properly take hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, including the following: Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are designed to work properly only if swallowed intact. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can result in a fatal overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Using hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets exactly as prescribed to reduce the risk of life-threatening adverse reactions (e.g., respiratory depression) Important Discontinuation Instructions In order to avoid developing withdrawal symptoms, instruct patients not to discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets without first discussing a tapering plan with the prescriber [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery Inform patients that hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may impair the ability to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery. Advise patients not to perform such tasks until they know how they will react to the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)]. Constipation Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation, including management instructions and when to seek medical attention [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Adrenal Insufficiency Inform patients that hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets could cause adrenal insufficiency, a potentially life-threatening condition. Adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Gastrointestinal Blockage Advise patients that people with certain stomach or intestinal problems such as narrowing of the intestines or previous surgery may be at higher risk of developing a blockage. Symptoms include abdominal distension, abdominal pain, severe constipation, or vomiting. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately if they develop these symptoms. Hypotension Inform patients that hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Instruct patients how to recognize symptoms of low blood pressure and how to reduce the risk of serious consequences should hypotension occur (e.g., sit or lie down, carefully rise from a sitting or lying position). Anaphylaxis Inform patients that anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction and when to seek medical attention [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.14), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Lactation Advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)]. Infertility Inform patients that use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Manufactured by: Ascent Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.1 ) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient's need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient's risk factors for overdose. ( 2.2 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a dosing range of 2.5 mL to 10 mL, 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. ( 2 , 5 ) Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. ( 2 , 5 ) Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride in a physically-dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. ( 2.7 , 5.14 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between mg and mL, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed. When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume. Instruct patients and caregivers on how to accurately measure and take or administer the correct dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Strongly advise patients and caregivers to always use a graduated oral syringe or measuring cup, with metric units of measurements (i.e., mL), to correctly measure the prescribed amount of medication. Inform patients and caregivers that oral dosing devices may be obtained from their pharmacy and to never use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solutions and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (2.1 , 5) ]. Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a dosing range of 2.5 mL to 10 mL, 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . 2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4) ] . Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. 2.3 Initial Dosage Initiating Treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a dosing range of 2.5 mL to 10 mL, 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. In general, it is safest to start hydromorphone hydrochloride therapy by administering half of the usual starting dose every 3 to 6 hours for hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution; and every 4 to 6 hours for hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. The dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride can be gradually adjusted until adequate pain relief and acceptable side effects have been achieved [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Conversion from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to Extended-Release Hydromorphone Hydrochloride The relative bioavailability of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets compared to extended-release hydromorphone is unknown, so conversion to extended-release hydromorphone may lead to increased risk of excessive sedation and respiratory depression. 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.5 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.6 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.14) ] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. A supplemental dose of 5 to 15% of the total daily usage may be administered every two hours on an as-needed basis. 2.7 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid dependent patient taking hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation. ( 5.7 ) Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Regularly evaluate patients, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.8 ) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.9 ) Severe Hypotension: Regularly evaluate patients during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.10 ) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor patients for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. Avoid dosing errors that may result from confusion between mg and mL and confusion with other hydromorphone oral solutions of different concentrations, when prescribing, dispensing, and administering hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. Instruct patients and caregivers on how to measure and take or administer the correct dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and to use extreme caution when measuring the dose. Strongly advise patients and caregivers to obtain and always use a graduated device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and to never use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure a dose because these are not accurate measuring devices. 5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, and reassess all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and the proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10) ] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered. Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.4) , Overdosage (10) ]. 5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate then on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Overdosage (10) ]. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.6 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG . Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com . The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint . 5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3) ]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . 5.8 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution- or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and when hydromorphone hydrochloride is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4) , Drug Interactions (7) ] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.9 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.10 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, hydromorphone hydrochloride may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.12 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.13 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets therapy. 5.14 Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]. Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and know how they will react to the medication. 5.16 Sulfites Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sulfite-containing medications."

Serious adverse reactions associated with hydromorphone hydrochloride include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Less Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations Eye disorders: vision blurred, diplopia, miosis, visual impairment Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, ileus, diarrhea, abdominal pain General disorders and administration site conditions: weakness, feeling abnormal , chills Hepatobiliary disorders: biliary colic Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle rigidity Nervous system disorders: headache, tremor, paraesthesia, nystagmus, increased intracranial pressure, syncope, taste alteration , involuntary muscle contractions, presyncope Psychiatric disorders: agitation, mood altered, nervousness, anxiety , depression, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia, abnormal dreams Renal and urinary disorders : urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: bronchospasm, laryngospasm Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria, rash, hyperhidrosis Vascular disorders: flushing, hypotension, hypertension 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of hydromorphone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Confusional state, convulsions, drowsiness, dyskinesia, dyspnea, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, hepatic enzymes increased, hyperalgesia, hypersensitivity reaction, lethargy, myoclonus, oropharyngeal swelling, peripheral edema, and somnolence. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Hypoglycemia: Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor (e.g., diabetes)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with hydromorphone hydrochloride. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with HYDROMORPHONE HYDROCHLORIDE Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4) ] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: Phenelzine, tranylcypromine, and linezolid. Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: Butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, and buprenorphine. Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4) ]. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) : Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with hydromorphone hydrochloride because they may reduce analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. There are no available data with hydromorphone hydrochloride in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data ]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of hydromorphone hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and regularly evaluated during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be regularly evaluated during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of hydromorphone hydrochloride abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use hydromorphone hydrochloride in combination with other abused drugs. \"Drug-seeking\" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \"loss\" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \"Doctor shopping\" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone hydrochloride, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of hydromorphone hydrochloride with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are approved for oral use only. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]."

      "9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of hydromorphone hydrochloride abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use hydromorphone hydrochloride in combination with other abused drugs. \"Drug-seeking\" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \"loss\" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \"Doctor shopping\" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone hydrochloride, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.6) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.3 , 2.6) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of hydromorphone hydrochloride is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-24 ) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the hydromorphone hydrochloride 8 mg tablet and an equivalent dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution has been demonstrated. After oral administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1 hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T \u00bd (hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) 8 mg Oral Liquid 5.7 (31%) 0.73 (71%) 24.6 (29%) 2.8 (20%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered C max by 25%, prolonged T max by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8 to 19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.1 ) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) Initial Dosage: - Intramuscular or Subcutaneous Use: The usual starting dose is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary. ( 2.2 ) - Intravenous Use : The usual starting dose is 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. The injection should be given slowly, over at least 2 to 3 minutes. ( 2.2 ) Hepatic Impairment: Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of hepatic impairment. ( 2.3 ) Renal Impairment : Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of renal impairment. ( 2.4 ) Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in a physically-dependent patient. ( 2.6 , 5.12 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] . Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Inspect Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. A 0.2 mg/mL admixture of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose is physically compatible and chemically stable for 24 hours at 25\u00b0C, protected from light. Use or discard multi-dose vials within 28 days of the first use. 2.2 Initial Dosage Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection as the First Opioid Analgesic Subcutaneous or Intramuscular Administration: Initiate treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in a dosing range of 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as needed for pain, and the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Intravenous Administration: The initial starting dose is 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. Intravenous administration should be given slowly , over at least 2 to 3 minutes, depending on the dose. The initial dose should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated and may be lowered to 0.2 mg. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. If the decision is made to convert to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection from another opioid analgesic using publicly available data, convert the current total daily amount(s) of opioid(s) received to an equivalent total daily dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and reduce by one-half due to the possibility of incomplete cross tolerance. Divide the new total amount by the number of doses permitted based on dosing interval (e.g., 8 doses for every-three-hour dosing). Titrate the dose according to the patient's response. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Start patients with hepatic impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection starting dose depending on the extent of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Individually titrate Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.12 )] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.6 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection When a patient who has been taking Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in a physically-dependent patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia : Opioid-Induced \u200eHyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic \u200eparadoxically causes an \u200eincrease in pain, or an increase in \u200esensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation. ( 5.5 ) Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.6 ) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.7 ) Severe Hypotension : Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.8 ) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection contains hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ] . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and monitor all patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage (10) ] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Overestimating the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.5 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] . Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . 5.6 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 ), Drug Interactions (7) ] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.7 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.8 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. In patients with circulatory shock, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patients with circulatory shock. 5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.11 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection therapy. 5.12 Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. When discontinuing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in these patients [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]. 5.13 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and know how they will react to the medication. 5.14 Increased Risk of Hypotension and Respiratory Depression with Rapid Intravenous Administration Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may be given intravenously, but the injection should be given very slowly. Rapid intravenous injection of opioid analgesics increases the possibility of side effects such as hypotension and respiratory depression [see Dosage and Administration (2)] ."

Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serious adverse reactions associated with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. TABLE 1. Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System Depressants (CNS) Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Monitor closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Intervention: The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and/or precipitate withdrawal syndrome. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs : Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection because they may reduce analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . There are reports of neonatal respiratory depression when hydromorphone is used during labor and delivery ( see Clinical Considerations) . Published studies and postmarketing reports on hydromorphone use during pregnancy are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased body weight were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively (see Data) . Based on human and animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Hydromorphone hydrochloride is transferred into human milk. There are reports of excessive sedation and respiratory depression in breastfed infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride. There is no information on the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in pediatric patients has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by renal impairment. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection contains hydromorphone, which is a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection contains hydromorphone hydrochloride, a substance with a high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in combination with other abused drugs. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection should not be abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . If Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur, typically characterized by restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]."

Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection should not be abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . If Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur, typically characterized by restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis, rather than miosis, may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent airway and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct effect on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope, manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) ]. Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8-19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume of distribution [mean (%CV)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone following an oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets) are affected by renal impairment. Mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC0-\u221e) is increased by 2-fold in patients with moderate (CL cr = 40 - 60 mL/min) renal impairment and increased by 4-fold in patients with severe (CL cr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CL cr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have a higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )], reserve Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]: \u2022 Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, \u2022 Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution contain hydromorphone, an opioid agonist, and are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use ( 1 ) Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration ( 5.2 ), reserve Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]: \u2022 Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, \u2022 Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) \u2022 Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) \u2022 Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient\u2019s need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose. ( 2.2 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) \u2022 Initiate treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in a dosing range of 2.5 mL to 10 mL, 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. ( 2 , 5 ) \u2022 Initiate treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. ( 2 , 5 ) \u2022 Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride in a physically-dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. ( 2.7 , 5.14 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between mg and mL, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed. When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume. Instruct patients and caregivers on how to accurately measure and take or administer the correct dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. Strongly advise patients and caregivers to always use a graduated oral syringe or measuring cup, with metric units of measurements (i.e., mL), to correctly measure the prescribed amount of medication. Inform patients and caregivers that oral dosing devices may be obtained from their pharmacy and to never use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. \u2022 Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. \u2022 There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. \u2022 Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions ( 2.1 , 5 )]. \u2022 Initiate treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in a dosing range of 2.5 mL to 10 mL, 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. \u2022 Initiate treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. 2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 )]. Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. 2.3 Initial Dosage Initiating Treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution Initiate treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in a dosing range of 2.5 mL to 10 mL, 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Initiate treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. In general, it is safest to start Hydromorphone Hydrochloride therapy by administering half of the usual starting dose every 3 to 6 hours for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution; and every 4 to 6 hours for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. The dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride can be gradually adjusted until adequate pain relief and acceptable side effects have been achieved [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Conversion from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to Extended-Release Hydromorphone Hydrochloride The relative bioavailability of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets compared to extended-release hydromorphone is unknown, so conversion to extended-release hydromorphone may lead to increased risk of excessive sedation and respiratory depression. 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.5 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.6 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.14 )]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. A supplemental dose of 5 to 15% of the total daily usage may be administered every two hours on an as-needed basis. 2.7 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid dependent patient taking Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Regularly evaluate patients, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Severe Hypotension: Regularly evaluate patients during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor patients for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. Avoid dosing errors that may result from confusion between mg and mL and confusion with other hydromorphone oral solutions of different concentrations, when prescribing, dispensing, and administering Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. Instruct patients and caregivers on how to measure and take or administer the correct dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and to use extreme caution when measuring the dose. Strongly advise patients and caregivers to obtain and always use a graduated device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and to never use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure a dose because these are not accurate measuring devices. 5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, and reassess all patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and the proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Overestimating the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] . Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered. Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.4 ), Overdosage ( 10 )]. 5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Overdosage ( 10 )]. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.6 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: \u2022 Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. \u2022 Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG . \u2022 Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. \u2022 Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com . The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint . 5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence ( 9.3 )]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )]. 5.8 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution- or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablet-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.9 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.10 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.12 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.13 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets therapy. 5.14 Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )]. Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and know how they will react to the medication. 5.16 Sulfites Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sulfite-containing medications."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-800-962-8364 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Serious adverse reactions associated with hydromorphone hydrochloride include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Less Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions Cardiac Disorders : tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations Eye Disorders : vision blurred, diplopia, miosis, visual impairment Gastrointestinal Disorders : constipation, ileus, diarrhea, abdominal pain General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : weakness, feeling abnormal, chills Hepatobiliary Disorders : biliary colic Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : decreased appetite Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : muscle rigidity Nervous System Disorders : headache, tremor, paraesthesia, nystagmus, increased intracranial pressure, syncope, taste alteration, involuntary muscle contractions, presyncope Psychiatric Disorders : agitation, mood altered, nervousness, anxiety, depression, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia, abnormal dreams Renal and Urinary Disorders : urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders : bronchospasm, laryngospasm Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : urticaria, rash, hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders : flushing, hypotension, hypertension 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of hydromorphone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Confusional state, convulsions, drowsiness, dyskinesia, dyspnea, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, hepatic enzymes increased, hyperalgesia, hypersensitivity reaction, lethargy, myoclonus, oropharyngeal swelling, peripheral edema, and somnolence. Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Androgen Deficiency Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )].

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 )]. Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: Phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid. Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: Butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine. Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.4 )]. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. \u2022 Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) \u2022 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) \u2022 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride because they may reduce analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. There are no available data with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions : Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Labor or Delivery : Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data : Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and regularly evaluated during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be regularly evaluated during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. There are no available data with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions : Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Labor or Delivery : Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data : Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested."

Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride in combination with other abused drugs. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are approved for oral use only. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )]. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.6 )]. Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.3 , 2.6 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-24 ) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride 8 mg TABLET and an equivalent dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution has been demonstrated. After oral administration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1 hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T 1/2 (hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) 8 mg Oral Liquid 5.7 (31%) 0.73 (71%) 24.6 (29%) 2.8 (20%) Food Effects : In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered C max by 25%, prolonged T max by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8% to 19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism : Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion : Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment : After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Renal Impairment : After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Age: Geriatric Population: In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex : Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.6 )]. Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.3 , 2.6 )]."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-24 ) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride 8 mg TABLET and an equivalent dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution has been demonstrated. After oral administration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1 hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T 1/2 (hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) 8 mg Oral Liquid 5.7 (31%) 0.73 (71%) 24.6 (29%) 2.8 (20%) Food Effects : In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered C max by 25%, prolonged T max by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8% to 19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism : Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion : Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment : After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Renal Impairment : After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Age: Geriatric Population: In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex : Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is indicated for use in opioid-tolerant patients who require higher doses of opioids for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternate treatments are inadequate. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking for one week or longer, around-the-clock medicine consisting of at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, or at least 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, or at least 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, or at least 8 g oral hydromorphone per day, or at least 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or at least 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. Patients must remain on around-the-clock opioids while administering Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF). Limitations of Use: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] , reserve Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products): \u2022 Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, \u2022 Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternate treatments are inadequate. ( 1 ) Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is an opioid agonist indicated for use in opioid-tolerant patients who require higher doses of opioids for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternate treatments are inadequate. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking, for one week or longer, around-the-clock medicine consisting of at least 60 mg of oral morphine per day, at least 25 mcg/hr of transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone per day, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per day, at least 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, at least 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid daily for a week or longer. Patients must remain on around-the-clock opioids when administering Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF). Limitations of Use: ( 1 ) Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration ( 5.1 ) , reserve Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products): \u2022 Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated \u2022 Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) \u2022 Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF). Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) \u2022 Initial Dosage: - Intramuscular or Subcutaneous Use: The usual starting dose is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary. ( 2.2 ) - Intravenous Use: The usual starting dose is 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. The injection should be given slowly, over at least 2 to 3 minutes. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is for opioid-tolerant patients only and should be used only if the amount of hydromorphone required can be delivered accurately with this formulation. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Impairment: Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of hepatic impairment. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of renal impairment. ( 2.4 ) \u2022 Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) in a physically-dependent patient. ( 2.6 , 5.13 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. \u2022 Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. \u2022 There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. \u2022 Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF). Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. \u2022 Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. A slight yellowish discoloration may develop in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) vials. No loss of potency has been demonstrated. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) are physically compatible and chemically stable for at least 24 hours at 25\u00b0C, protected from light in most common large-volume parenteral solutions. \u2022 Discard any unused portion in an appropriate manner. 500 mg/50 mL Vial To use this single dose presentation, withdraw the contents using aseptic technique for preparation of a single, large-volume parenteral solution. Discard any unused portion in an appropriate manner. 2.2 Initial Dosage Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] as the First Opioid Analgesic: Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) is for use in opioid tolerant patients only. Do not use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) for patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant or sedating effects of opioids. Subcutaneous or Intramuscular Administration: The usual starting dose is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary for pain, and the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Depending on the clinical situation, the initial starting dose may be lowered in patients who are opioid na\u00efve. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF). Intravenous Administration: The initial starting dose is 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. Intravenous administration should be given slowly, over at least 2 to 3 minutes, depending on the dose. The initial dose should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated and may be lowered to 0.2 mg. Conversion From Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]: There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF). It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. If the decision is made to convert to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection from another opioid analgesic using publicly available data, convert the current total daily amount(s) of opioid(s) received to an equivalent total daily dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and reduce by one-half due to the possibility of incomplete cross tolerance. Divide the new total amount by the number of doses permitted based on dosing interval (e.g., 8 doses for every-three-hour dosing). Titrate the dose according to the patient's response. Use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) ONLY for patients who require the higher concentration and lower total volume of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF). Because of its high concentration, the delivery of precise doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) may be difficult if low doses of hydromorphone are required. Therefore, use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) only if the amount of hydromorphone required can be delivered accurately with this formulation. Base the starting dose for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) on the prior dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or on the prior dose of an alternate opioid. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Start patients with hepatic impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection starting dose depending on the extent of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF). Individually titrate Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.13 )]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.6 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) When a patient who has been taking Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF), taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) in a physically-dependent patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia : Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic, or opioid rotation. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Severe Hypotension: Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) contain sodium metabisulfite. There is a risk of anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening asthmatic episodes in susceptible people. ( 5.15 ) 5.1 Risk of Medication Errors Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is a 10 mg/mL concentrated solution of hydromorphone, and is intended for use in opioid-tolerant patients only. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg oral morphine/day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl/hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone/day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone/day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone/day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. Do not confuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) with standard parenteral formulations of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (1 mg/mL, 2 mg/mL, 4 mg/mL) or other opioids, as overdose and death could result. 5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF). Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF), and monitor all patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF), but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF). Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) are essential [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Overestimating the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) is for use in opioid-tolerant patients only . Administration of this formulation may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. 5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.6 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence ( 9.3 )]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )]. 5.7 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre- existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] and when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.9 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF). In patients with circulatory shock, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) in patients with circulatory shock. 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF). Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.12 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) therapy. 5.13 Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. When discontinuing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) in these patients [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )]. 5.14 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) and know how they will react to the medication. 5.15 Sulfites Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. 5.16 Increased Risk of Hypotension and Respiratory Depression with Rapid Intravenous Administration Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may be given intravenously, but the injection should be given very slowly. Rapid intravenous injection of opioid analgesics increases the possibility of side effects such as hypotension and respiratory depression [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and/or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Table 1. Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and/or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System Depressants (CNS) Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Monitor patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) and/or precipitate withdrawal syndrome. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. \u2022 Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or [high potency formulation (HPF)] if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) \u2022 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) \u2022 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics : Avoid use with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) because they may reduce analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . There are no available data with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes. There are adverse outcomes reported with fetal exposure to opioid analgesics (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased body weight were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data ]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF), can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in pediatric patients has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by renal impairment. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] contain hydromorphone, which is a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] contains hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in combination with other abused drugs. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] should not be abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. If Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur, typically characterized by restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]."

Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in combination with other abused drugs. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF) with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV."

    "dependence": [
      "9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] should not be abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. If Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur, typically characterized by restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis, rather than miosis, may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent airway and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (HPF), carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct effect on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope, manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists . The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 )] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8-19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume of distribution [mean (%CV)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3- glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone following an oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets) are affected by renal impairment. Mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC0-\u221e) is increased by 2-fold in patients with moderate (CLcr = 40 - 60 mL/min) renal impairment and increased by 4-fold in patients with severe (CLcr< 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr> 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have a higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.1 ) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient\u2019s need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose. ( 2.2 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. ( 2 , 5 ) Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a physically-dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. ( 2.7 , 5.14 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5 )]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 )]. Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (2.1 , 5 )]. Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. 2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 )] . Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. 2.3 Initial Dosage Initiating Treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. In general, it is safest to start hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets therapy by administering half of the usual starting dose every 4 to 6 hours for hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. The dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets can be gradually adjusted until adequate pain relief and acceptable side effects have been achieved [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Conversion from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to Extended-Release Hydromorphone Hydrochloride The relative bioavailability of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets compared to extended-release hydromorphone is unknown, so conversion to extended-release hydromorphone may lead to increased risk of excessive sedation and respiratory depression. 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.5 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.6 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.14 )] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. A supplemental dose of 5 to 15% of the total daily usage may be administered every two hours on an as-needed basis. 2.7 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid dependent patient taking hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation. ( 5.7 ) Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Regularly evaluate patients, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.8 ) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.9 ) Severe Hypotension: Regularly evaluate patients during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.10 ) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death Due to Medication Errors Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. 5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ] . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, and reassess all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and the proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage (10) ] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered. Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.4 ), Overdosage (10) ] . 5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)]. If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate then on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Overdosage (10)]. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.6 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG. Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com. The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint. 5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3)] . Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. 5.8 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease : Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablet-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Regularly evaluate such patients, particularly when initiating and titrating hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and when hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 ), Drug Interactions (7)]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.9 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.10 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [ see Drug Interactions (7)]. Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.12 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.13 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets therapy. 5.14 Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] . Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and know how they will react to the medication. 5.16 Sulfites Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sulfite-containing medications."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Interactions with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Severe Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] Most common adverse reactions are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mallinckrodt at 1-800-778-7898 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Serious adverse reactions associated with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Less Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations Eye disorders: vision blurred, diplopia, miosis, visual impairment Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, ileus, diarrhea, abdominal pain General disorders and administration site conditions: weakness, feeling abnormal, chills Hepatobiliary disorders: biliary colic Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle rigidity Nervous system disorders: headache, tremor, paraesthesia, nystagmus, increased intracranial pressure, syncope, taste alteration, involuntary muscle contractions, presyncope Psychiatric disorders: agitation, mood altered, nervousness, anxiety, depression, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia, abnormal dreams Renal and urinary disorders: urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: bronchospasm, laryngospasm Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria, rash, hyperhidrosis Vascular disorders: flushing, hypotension, hypertension 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of hydromorphone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Confusional state, convulsions, drowsiness, dyskinesia, dyspnea, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, hepatic enzymes increased, hyperalgesia, hypersensitivity reaction, lethargy, myoclonus, oropharyngeal swelling, peripheral edema, and somnolence. Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Hyperalgesia and Allodynia : Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Hypoglycemia : Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor (e.g., diabetes)."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3 , 5.4 )] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: Phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid. Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: Butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine. Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 )]. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. If serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) : Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets because they may reduce analgesic effect of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . There are no available data with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data] . Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or non-medical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high-pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and regularly evaluated during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be regularly evaluated during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in combination with other abused drugs. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are approved for oral use only. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] ."

Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are approved for oral use only. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV."

    "dependence": [
      "9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration-Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.6 )] . Concentration-Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.3 , 2.6 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-24 ) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). After oral administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1 hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T \u00bd (hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered C max by 25%, prolonged T max by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8 to 19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC \u221e ) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Storage and Disposal Because of the risks associated with accidental ingestion, misuse, and abuse, advise patients to store hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets securely, out of sight and reach of children, and in a location not accessible by others, including visitors to the home. Inform patients that leaving hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets unsecured can pose a deadly risk to others in the home [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2) ] . Advise patients and caregivers that when medicines are no longer needed, they should be disposed of promptly. Expired, unwanted, or unused hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets should be disposed of by flushing the unused medication down the toilet if a drug take-back option is not readily available. Inform patients that they can visit www.fda.gov/drugdisposal for a complete list of medicines recommended for disposal by flushing, as well as additional information on disposal of unused medicines. Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Inform patients that the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Instruct patients not to share hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets with others and to take steps to protect hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets from theft or misuse. Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression, including information that the risk is greatest when starting hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets or when the dosage is increased, and that it can occur even at recommended dosages. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Accidental Ingestion Inform patients that accidental ingestion, especially by children, may result in respiratory depression or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Interactions with Benzodiazepines and Other CNS Depressants Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, and not to use these concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Interactions (7)]. Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss with the patient and caregiver the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose. Explain to patients and caregivers that naloxone\u2019s effects are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see Overdosage (10 )] . If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers: How to treat with naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose To tell family and friends about their naloxone and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency To read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their naloxone.

Individualize dosing based on the severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. (2.1) Usual adult dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution is one-half (2.5 mL) to two teaspoonsful (10 mL) (2.5 mg - 10 mg) every 3 to 6 hours. (2.2) Hepatic Impairment : Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of hepatic impairment. (2.3) Renal Impairment : Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of renal impairment. (2.4) Do not stop Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution abruptly in a physically-dependent patient. (2.5) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between mg and mL, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed. When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume. Instruct patients to obtain a calibrated measuring cup/syringe for administering Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution to ensure that the dose is measured and administered accurately. Do not use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, as using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon could lead to overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and adjust the dosage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 2.2 Initial Dosage Initiating Treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution Initiate treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in a dosing range of one-half (2.5 mL to two teaspoonsful (10 mL (2.5 mg - 10 mg) every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. In general, it is safest to start Hydromorphone Hydrochloride therapy by administering half of the usual starting dose every 3-6 hours for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. The dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride can be gradually adjusted until adequate pain relief and acceptable side effects have been achieved [ See Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Conversion from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution to Extended-Release Hydromorphone Hydrochloride The relative bioavailability of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution compared to extended-release Hydromorphone Hydrochloride is unknown, so conversion to extended-release tablets must be accompanied by close observation for signs of excessive sedation and respiratory depression. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. For chronic pain, doses should be administered around-the-clock. A supplemental dose of 5-15% of the total daily usage may be administered every two hours on an as-needed basis. 2.6 Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution When a patient who has been taking Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs and symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in a physically dependent patient. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. (5.6) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. (5.7) Severe Hypotension: Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in patients with circulatory shock. (5.8) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors , Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. (5.9) 5.1 Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. Given the inexactitude of the household spoon measure and the possibility of using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon, which could lead to overdosage, the enclosed measuring device should be used or a calibrated measuring device obtained from the pharmacist. Health care providers should recommend a calibrated device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and instruct caregivers to use extreme caution in measuring the dosage . 5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, and monitor all patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage (10)] . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Overestimating the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)] . 5.5 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17)] 5.6 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.7 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.8 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. In patients with circulatory shock, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in patients with circulatory shock. 5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.11 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution therapy. 5.12 Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7)] . When discontinuing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] . Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in these patients. [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)] . 5.13 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and know how they will react to the medication. 5.14 Sulfites Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sulfite-containing medications."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Interactions with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Severe Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12] Most common adverse reactions are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. (6) To report Suspected Adverse Reactions, contact Ascent Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-855-221-1622 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Serious adverse reactions associated with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Less Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations Eye disorders: vision blurred, diplopia, miosis, visual impairment Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, ileus, diarrhea, abdominal pain General disorders and administration site conditions: weakness, feeling abnormal , chills Hepatobiliary disorders: biliary colic Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle rigidity Nervous system disorders: headache, tremor, paraesthesia, nystagmus, increased intracranial pressure, syncope, taste alteration , involuntary muscle contractions, presyncope Psychiatric disorders: agitation, mood altered, nervousness, anxiety , depression, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia, abnormal dreams Renal and urinary disorders: urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: bronchospasm, laryngospasm Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria, rash, hyperhidrosis Vascular disorders: flushing, hypotension, hypertension 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of hydromorphone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Confusional state, convulsions, drowsiness, dyskinesia, dyspnea, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, hepatic enzymes increased, hyperalgesia, hypersensitivity reaction, lethargy, myoclonus, oropharyngeal swelling, peripheral edema, and somnolence. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.X)] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine, Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution if serotonin syndrome is suspected. (7) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride because they may reduce analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. (8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. There are no available data with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day Hydromorphone Hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in Cmax and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one- half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution contain Hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution contain hydromorphone, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, morphine, oxymorphone and tapentadol. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution are for oral use only. Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Lqiuid with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution should not be abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. If Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution are abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur. Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome: restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] .. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5)] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.5)] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (Cmax and AUC0-24) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride 8 mg Tablet and an equivalent dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution has been demonstrated. After oral administration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1-hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T \u00bd (hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) 8 mg Oral Liquid 5.7 (31%) 0.73 (71%) 24.6 (29%) 2.8 (20%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered Cmax by 25%, prolonged Tmax by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8-19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half- life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6- hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (Cmax and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in Cmax and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone ( Cmax and AUC0-48) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 - 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher Cmax (25%) than males with comparable AUC0-24 values. The difference observed in Cmax may not be clinically relevant."

Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, misuse, overdose, and death, which can occur at any dosage or duration and persist over the course of therapy, reserve opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection should be \u200eprescribed only by healthcare professionals who are \u200eknowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to \u200emitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 )\u200e \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of Hydromorphone \u200eHydrochloride Injection for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently \u200eeffective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid \u200eclearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) \u2022 Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with \u200ea number of surgical procedures or acute \u200emusculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few \u200edays of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on \u200eopioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are \u200eavailable. ( 2.1 )\u200e \u2022 Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, \u200etaking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and \u200eresponse, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid \u200etherapy, especially when initiating and following dosage \u200eincreases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. \u200eConsider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when \u200emaking dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.2 )\u200e \u2022 Intramuscular and Subcutaneous Use : The usual starting dose is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Intravenous Use : The usual starting dose is 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. The injection should be given slowly , over at least 2 to 3 minutes. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Impairment : Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of hepatic impairment. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment : Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of renal impairment. ( 2.4 ) \u2022 Periodically reassess patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection to evaluate the continued need for opioid analgesics to maintain pain control, for the signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse. ( 2.5 ) \u2022 Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in a physically-dependent patient. ( 2.6 , 5.12 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection should be prescribed only by healthcare \u200eprofessionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to \u200emitigate the associated risks.\u200e \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. Because \u200ethe risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to \u200ehigher doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection for patients in whom \u200elower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of \u200eusing a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.\u200e \u2022 Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical \u200eprocedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days \u200eof an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute \u200epain conditions are available.\u200e \u2022 There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to \u200eadequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient \u200efactors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . \u2022 Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and \u200ewhen making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. \u2022 Inspect Hydromorphone Hydrochloride for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if there is any discoloration or precipitate. A slight yellowish discoloration may develop in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection ampuls. No loss of potency has been demonstrated. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is physically compatible and chemically stable for at least 24 hours at 25\u00b0C protected from light in most common large volume parenteral solutions. \u2022 Discard any unused portion in an appropriate manner. 2.2 Initial Dosage Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection as the First Opioid Analgesic Subcutaneous or Intramuscular Administration Initiate treatment in a dosing range of 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Depending on the clinical situation, the initial starting dose may be lowered in patients who are opioid na\u00efve. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose \u200eof Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection.\u200e Intravenous Administration Initiate treatment in a dosing range of 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary for pain control\u200e, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Intravenous administration should be given slowly, over at least 2 to 3 minutes, depending on the dose. Titrate the dose to achieve acceptable pain management and tolerable adverse events. The initial dose should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated and may be lowered to 0.2 mg. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. If the decision is made to convert to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection from another opioid analgesic using publicly available data, convert the current total daily amount(s) of opioid(s) received to an equivalent total daily dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and reduce by one-half due to the possibility of incomplete cross tolerance. Divide the new total amount by the number of doses permitted based on dosing interval (e.g., 8 doses for every-three-hour dosing). Titrate the dose according to the patient's response. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Start patients with hepatic impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection depending on the extent of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection depending on the degree of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone \u200eHydrochloride Injection. Individually titrate Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.12) ] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase \u200ein pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.6 Safe Reduction and Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection When a patient who has been taking Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patient s who may be physically dependent on opioids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia : Opioid-Induced \u200eHyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic \u200eparadoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in \u200esensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately \u200edecreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or \u200eopioid rotation. ( 5.5 )\u200e \u2022 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Adrenal Insufficiency : If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Severe Hypotension : Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection contains hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ] . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. The risk of opioid-related overdose or overdose-related death is increased with higher opioid doses, and this risk persists over the course of therapy. In postmarketing studies, addiction, abuse, misuse, and fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose were observed in patients with long-term opioid use [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, and monitor all patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid overdose reversal agent (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene) , depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10) ] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Overestimating the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids [gabapentin or pregabalin], and other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life\u2011threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.5 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic \u200eparadoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. \u200eThis condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of \u200eopioids to maintain a defined effect [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] . Symptoms of OIH \u200einclude (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage \u200eincrease, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from \u200eordinarily non\u2011painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only \u200eif there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, \u200eopioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.\u200e Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of \u200eopioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, \u200emultiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests \u200ea strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a \u200epatient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately \u200edecreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely \u200eswitching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and \u200eAdministration (2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] .\u200e 5.6 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.7 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.8 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. In patients with circulatory shock, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patients with circulatory shock. 5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for worsening of signs of increasing intracranial pressure.\u200e Monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.10 Risks of Gastrointestinal Complications Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Cases of opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED) have been reported in patients taking opioids. The risk of OIED may increase as the dose and/or duration of opioids increases. Regularly evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of OIED (e.g., dysphagia, regurgitation, non-cardiac chest pain) and, if necessary, adjust opioid therapy as clinically appropriate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 5.11 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection therapy. 5.12 Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . When discontinuing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in these patients [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] . 5.13 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and know how they will react to the medication. 5.14 Increased Risk of Hypotension and Respiratory Depression with Rapid Intravenous Administration Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may be given intravenously, but the injection should be given very slowly. Rapid intravenous injection of opioid analgesics increases the possibility of side effects such as hypotension and respiratory depression [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: \u2022 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Interactions with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]\u200e \u2022 Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Severe Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] \u2022 Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] \u2022 Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of hydromorphone were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most common adverse effects are light-headedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Most common adverse reactions are light-headedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. Serious adverse reactions include respiratory depression and apnea, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock and cardiac arrest.

Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time. Hyperalgesia and Allodynia : Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been \u200ereported with opioid therapy of any duration. [see Warnings and Precautions \u200e\u200e(5.5) ]\u200e . Hypoglycemia : Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients \u200etaking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one \u200epredisposing risk factor (e.g., diabetes). Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED) : Cases of OIED have been reported in patients taking opioids and may occur more frequently in patients taking higher doses of opioids, and/or in patients taking opioids longer term [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . Adverse Reactions from Observational Studies A prospective, observational cohort study estimated the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse in patients initiating long-term use of Schedule II opioid analgesics between 2017 and 2021. Study participants included in one or more analyses had been enrolled in selected insurance plans or health systems for at least one year, were free of at least one outcome at baseline, completed a minimum number of follow-up assessments, and either: 1) filled multiple extended-release/long-acting opioid analgesic prescriptions during a 90-day period (n=978); or 2) filled any Schedule II opioid analgesic prescriptions covering at least 70 of 90 days (n=1,244). Those included also had no dispensing of the qualifying opioids in the previous 6 months. Over 12 months: \u2022 approximately 1% to 6% of participants across the two cohorts newly met criteria for addiction, as assessed with two validated interview-based measures of moderate-to-severe opioid use disorder based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria, and \u2022 approximately 9% and 22% of participants across the two cohorts newly met criteria for prescription opioid abuse and misuse [defined in Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2) ] , respectively, as measured with a validated self-reported instrument. A retrospective, observational cohort study estimated the risk of opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death in patients with new long-term use of Schedule II opioid analgesics from 2006 through 2016 (n=220,249). Included patients had been enrolled in either one of two commercial insurance programs, one managed care program, or one Medicaid program for at least 9 months. New long-term use was defined as having Schedule II opioid analgesic prescriptions covering at least 70 days\u2019 supply over the 3 months prior to study entry and none during the preceding 6 months. Patients were excluded if they had an opioid-involved overdose in the 9 months prior to study entry. Overdose was measured using a validated medical code-based algorithm with linkage to the National Death Index database. The 5-year cumulative incidence estimates for opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death ranged from approximately 1.5% to 4% across study sites, counting only the first event during follow-up. Approximately 17% of first opioid overdoses observed over the entire study period (5-11 years, depending on the study site) were fatal. Higher baseline opioid dose was the strongest and most consistent predictor of opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death. Study exclusion criteria may have selected patients at lower risk of overdose, and substantial loss to follow-up (approximately 80%) also may have biased estimates. The risk estimates from the studies described above may not be generalizable to all patients receiving opioid analgesics, such as those with exposures shorter or longer than the duration evaluated in the studies. \u200e"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Monitor patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation. Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids (gabapentin or pregabalin), other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Intervention: The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Examples: cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. \u2022 Serotonergic Drugs : Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) \u2022 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) : Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) \u2022 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics : Avoid use with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection because they may reduce analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) \u2022 Geriatric Patients : Use caution during dose selection, starting at the low \u200eend of the dosing range while carefully monitoring for side effects. \u200e\u200e( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . There are no available data with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes\u200e.\u200e There are adverse outcomes reported with fetal exposure to opioid analgesics [see \u200e Clinical \u200e\u200eConsiderations ] . In published animal reproduction studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data ] . Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid overdose reversal agent, such as naloxone or nalmefene, must be available for reversal of opioid\u2011induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data No effects on teratogenicity or embryotoxicity were observed in pregnant rats given oral doses up to 7 mg/kg/day which is 3-fold higher than the human dose of 24 mg Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (4 mg every 4 hours), on a body surface area basis. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in pediatric patients has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one fourth to one half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection contains hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection contains hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of \u200esubstance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an \u200eindividual in a way other than \u200eprescribed by a healthcare provider or for \u200ewhom it was not prescribed.\u200e Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug, use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection increases \u200erisk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and \u200erespiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is \u200eincreased with concurrent abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride \u200eInjection with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants.\u200e Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be \u200eaccompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical \u200edependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of \u200eaddiction.\u200e All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation \u200efor signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic \u200eproducts carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. \u200ePatients at high risk of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection abuse \u200einclude those with a history of prolonged use of \u200e any opioid, including products containing \u200ehydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those \u200ewho use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in combination with \u200eother abused drugs.\u200e \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to \u200ea drug after repeated administration (i.e., a \u200ehigher dose of a drug is \u200erequired to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower \u200edose).\u200e Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological \u200eadaptation in response to repeated drug use, \u200emanifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection should not be rapidly reduced or abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. If Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur, typically characterized by restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically-dependent on opioids will also be physically-dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Toxic leukoencephalopathy has been reported after opioid overdose and can present hours, days, or weeks after apparent recovery from the initial intoxication. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose, administer an opioid overdose reversal agent such as naloxone or nalmefene. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid overdose reversal agent is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional reversal agent as directed by the product's prescribing information. In an individual physically-dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the opioid overdose reversal agent will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the reversal agent administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically-dependent patient, administration of the reversal agent should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the reversal agent."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the m\u00b5-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, transient elevations in serum amylase, and opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED). Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.5) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.5 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8\u201319% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume of distribution [mean (%cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC \u221e ) is increased 4 fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one fourth to one half the recommended starting dose and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone following an oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets) are affected by renal impairment. Mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0\u2013\u221e ) is increased by 2 fold in patients with moderate (CLcr = 40 \u2013 60 mL/min) renal impairment and increased by 4 fold in patients with severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have a higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0\u201324 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is indicated for use in opioid-tolerant patients who require higher doses of opioids for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternate treatments are inadequate. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking for one week or longer, around-the-clock medicine consisting of at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, or at least 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, or at least 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, or at least 8 g oral hydromorphone per day, or at least 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or at least 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. Patients must remain on around-the-clock opioids while administering Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is an opioid agonist indicated for use in opioid-tolerant patients who require higher doses of opioids for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternate treatments are inadequate. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking, for one week or longer, around-the-clock medicine consisting of at least 60 mg of oral morphine per day, at least 25 mcg/hr of transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone per day, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per day, at least 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, at least 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid daily for a week or longer. Patients must remain on around-the-clock opioids when administering Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Limitations of Use: ( 1 ) Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration ( 5.2 ), reserve Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products): \u2022 Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, \u2022 Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate. Limitations of Use: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] , reserve Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products): \u2022 Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, \u2022 Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) \u2022 Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) \u2022 Initial Dosage: - Intramuscular or Subcutaneous Use: The usual starting dose is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary. ( 2.2 ) - Intravenous Use: The usual starting dose is 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. The injection should be given slowly, over at least 2 to 3 minutes. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is for opioid-tolerant patients only and should be used only if the amount of hydromorphone required can be delivered accurately with this formulation. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Impairment: Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of hepatic impairment. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of renal impairment. ( 2.4 ) \u2022 Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in a physically-dependent patient. ( 2.6, 5.13 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. \u2022 Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. \u2022 There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . \u2022 Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . \u2022 Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. A slight yellowish discoloration may develop in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] vials. No loss of potency has been demonstrated. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is physically compatible and chemically stable for at least 24 hours at 25\u00b0C, protected from light in most common large-volume parenteral solutions. \u2022 Discard any unused portion in an appropriate manner. 500 mg/50 mL Vial To use this single-dose presentation, withdraw the contents using aseptic technique for preparation of a single, large-volume parenteral solution. Discard any unused portion in an appropriate manner. 2.2 Initial Dosage Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] as the First Opioid Analgesic: Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is for use in opioid tolerant patients only. Do not use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant or sedating effects of opioids. Subcutaneous or Intramuscular Administration: The usual starting dose is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary for pain, and the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Depending on the clinical situation, the initial starting dose may be lowered in patients who are opioid na\u00efve. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Intravenous Administration : The initial starting dose is 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. Intravenous administration should be given slowly , over at least 2 to 3 minutes, depending on the dose. The initial dose should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated and may be lowered to 0.2 mg. Conversion From Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]: There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. If the decision is made to convert to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] from another opioid analgesic using publicly available data, convert the current total daily amount(s) of opioid(s) received to an equivalent total daily dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] and reduce by one-half due to the possibility of incomplete cross tolerance. Divide the new total amount by the number of doses permitted based on dosing interval (e.g., 8 doses for every-three-hour dosing). Titrate the dose according to the patient's response. Use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] ONLY for patients who require the higher concentration and lower total volume of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Because of its high concentration, the delivery of precise doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may be difficult if low doses of hydromorphone are required. Therefore, use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] only if the amount of hydromorphone required can be delivered accurately with this formulation. Base the starting dose for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] on the prior dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or on the prior dose of an alternate opioid. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients With Hepatic Impairment Start patients with hepatic impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection starting dose depending on the extent of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients With Renal Impairment Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Individually titrate Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.13 )] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.6 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] When a patient who has been taking Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] regularly and may be physically-dependent no longer requires therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in a physically-dependent patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] ."

( 5.10 ) 5.1 Risk of Medication Errors Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is a 10 mg/mL concentrated solution of hydromorphone, and is intended for use in opioid-tolerant patients only. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg oral morphine/day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl/hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone/day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone/day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone/day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. Do not confuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] with standard parenteral formulations of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, as overdose and death could result. 5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ] . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], and monitor all patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10) ] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Overestimating the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is for use in opioid-tolerant patients only . Administration of this formulation may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.6 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3) ] . Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] . 5.7 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients With Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients With Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] and when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4) , Drug Interactions (7) ] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.9 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. In patients with circulatory shock, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in patients with circulatory shock. 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients With Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients With Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.12 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients With Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] therapy. 5.13 Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . When discontinuing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in these patients [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] . 5.14 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] and know how they will react to the medication . 5.15 Increased Risk of Hypotension and Respiratory Depression With Rapid Intravenous Administration Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] may be given intravenously, but the injection should be given very slowly. Rapid intravenous injection of opioid analgesics increases the possibility of side effects such as hypotension and respiratory depression [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Table 1. Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System Depressants (CNS) Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Monitor patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] and/or precipitate withdrawal syndrome. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. \u2022 Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) \u2022 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) \u2022 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] because they may reduce analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . There are no available data with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes. There are adverse outcomes reported with fetal exposure to opioid analgesics (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased body weight were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data ]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in pediatric patients has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by renal impairment. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . There are no available data with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes. There are adverse outcomes reported with fetal exposure to opioid analgesics (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased body weight were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data ]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates.

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] contains hydromorphone, which is a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] contains hydromorphone hydrochloride, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] in combination with other abused drugs. \"Drug-seeking\" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \"loss\" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \"Doctor shopping\" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] should not be abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . If Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur, typically characterized by restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically-dependent on opioids will also be physically-dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis, rather than miosis, may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent airway and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)], carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information. In an individual physically-dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically-dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct effect on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope, manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8\u201319% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume of distribution [mean (%CV)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC \u221e ) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone following an oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets) are affected by renal impairment. Mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0\u2013\u221e ) is increased by 2-fold in patients with moderate (CLcr = 40 \u2013 60 mL/min) renal impairment and increased by 4-fold in patients with severe (CLcr< 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr> 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have a higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0\u201324 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct effect on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope, manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) ] ."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8\u201319% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume of distribution [mean (%CV)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC \u221e ) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone following an oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets) are affected by renal impairment. Mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0\u2013\u221e ) is increased by 2-fold in patients with moderate (CLcr = 40 \u2013 60 mL/min) renal impairment and increased by 4-fold in patients with severe (CLcr< 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr> 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have a higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0\u201324 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

      "1 INDICATIONS & USAGE Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )], reserve Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]: Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated, Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain hydromorphone, an opioid agonist, and are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use ( 1 ) Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, reserve Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products: \u2022 Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, \u2022 Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia"
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Individualize dosing based on the severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 ) Usual adult starting dose for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours. ( 2.2) Hepatic Impairment: Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of hepatic impairment. ( 2.3 ) Renal Impairment: Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of renal impairment. ( 2.4 ) Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a physically-dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide ( 2.6) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. 2.2 Initial Dosage Initiating Treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Initiate treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a dosing range of 2 mg to 4 mg, orally, every 4 to 6 hours. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. In general, it is safest to start Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets therapy by administering half of the usual starting dose every 4 to 6 hours for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. The dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets can be gradually adjusted until adequate pain relief and acceptable side effects have been achieved [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Conversion from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to Extended-Release Hydromorphone Hydrochloride The relative bioavailability of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets compared to extended-release hydromorphone hydrochloride is unknown, so conversion to extended-release tablets must be accompanied by close observation for signs of excessive sedation and respiratory depression. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. For chronic pain, doses should be administered around-the-clock. A supplemental dose of 5 to 15% of the total daily usage may be administered every two hours on an as-needed basis. 2.6 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablet Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid dependent patient taking Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.7 ) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.8 ) Severe Hypotension: Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.9 ) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. Given the inexactitude of the household spoon measure and the possibility of using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon, which could lead to over dosage, the enclosed measuring device should be used or a calibrated measuring device obtained from the pharmacist. Healthcare providers should recommend a calibrated device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and instruct caregivers to use extreme caution in measuring the dosage. 5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, and monitor all patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.3 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG. Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com. The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint. 5.4 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Overestimating the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . 5.6 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. 5.7 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets - treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.9 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.12 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets therapy. 5.13Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )]. Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.14 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and know how they will react to the medication. 5.15 Sulfites Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sulfite-containing medications.."

Serious adverse reactions associated with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Less Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations Eye disorders: vision blurred, diplopia, miosis, visual impairment Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, ileus, diarrhea, abdominal pain General disorders and administration site conditions: weakness, feeling abnormal , chills Hepatobiliary disorders: biliary colic Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle rigidity Nervous system disorders: headache, tremor, paraesthesia, nystagmus, increased intracranial pressure, syncope, taste alteration , involuntary muscle contractions, presyncope Psychiatric disorders: agitation, mood altered, nervousness, anxiety , depression, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia, abnormal dreams Renal and urinary disorders : urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: bronchospasm, laryngospasm Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria, rash, hyperhidrosis Vascular disorders: flushing, hypotension, hypertension 6.2 Post marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of hydromorphone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Confusional state, convulsions, drowsiness, dyskinesia, dyspnea, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, hepatic enzymes increased, hyperalgesia, hypersensitivity reaction, lethargy, myoclonus, oropharyngeal swelling, peripheral edema, and somnolence. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] ."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone),monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Intervention: The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine, Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. (7) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. (7) Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets because they may reduce analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. There are no available data with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, reduced postnatal survival of pups, and decreased were noted following oral treatment of pregnant rats with hydromorphone during gestation and through lactation at doses 0.8 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day (HDD), respectively. In published studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in Cmax and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain hydromorphone, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, morphine, oxymorphone and tapentadol. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are for oral use only. Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence is a physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after a period of regular exposure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. Do not abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )]. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent opioid agonist. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.5 )] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.5 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The analgesic activity of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (Cmax and AUC0-24) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. In vivo bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets 8 mg TABLET and an equivalent dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets has been demonstrated. After oral administration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within \u00bd to 1 hour. Mean (%cv) Dosage Form C max (ng) T max (hrs) AUC (ng*hr/mL) T \u00bd(hrs) 8 mg Tablet 5.5 (33%) 0.74 (34%) 23.7 (28%) 2.6 (18%) Food Effects In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered Cmax by 25%, prolonged Tmax by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant. Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8-19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (Cmax and AUC\u221e) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in Cmax and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal Impairment After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0-48 ) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 - 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC0-24 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent opioid agonist. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.5 )] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.5 )]."

Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use : Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, misuse, overdose, and death, which can occur at any dosage or duration and persist over the course of therapy, reserve opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection should be \u200eprescribed only by healthcare professionals who are \u200eknowledgeable about the use of opioids \u200eand how to \u200emitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 )\u200e \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of Hydromorphone \u200eHydrochloride Injection for \u200epatients in whom lower doses are insufficiently \u200eeffective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid \u200eclearly outweigh \u200ethe substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) \u2022 Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with \u200ea number of surgical procedures or acute \u200emusculoskeletal injuries) require no more \u200ethan a few \u200edays of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on \u200eopioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are \u200eavailable. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, \u200etaking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid \u200etherapy, especially when initiating and following dosage \u200eincreases with \u200eHydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. \u200eConsider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when \u200emaking dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.2 )\u200e \u2022 Intramuscular and Subcutaneous Use : The usual starting dose is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Intravenous Use : The usual starting dose is 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. The injection should be given slowly , over at least 2 to 3 minutes. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Impairment : Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of hepatic impairment. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment : Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of renal impairment. ( 2.4 ) \u2022 Periodically reassess patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection to evaluate the continued need for opioid analgesics to maintain pain control, for the signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse. ( 2.5 ) \u2022 Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in a physically-dependent patient. ( 2.6 , 5.12 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection should be prescribed only by healthcare \u200eprofessionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to \u200emitigate the associated risks. \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Because \u200ethe risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to \u200ehigher doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection for patients in whom \u200elower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of \u200eusing a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.\u200e \u2022 Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical \u200eprocedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days \u200eof an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute \u200epain conditions are available. \u2022 There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to \u200eadequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient \u200efactors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . \u2022 Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and \u200ewhen making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. \u2022 Inspect Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. A slight yellowish discoloration may develop in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. No loss of potency has been demonstrated. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is physically compatible and chemically stable for at least 24 hours at 25\u00b0C protected from light in most common large volume parenteral solutions. \u2022 Discard any unused portion in an appropriate manner. 2.2 Initial Dosage Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection as the First Opioid Analgesic Subcutaneous or Intramuscular Administration Initiate treatment in a dosing range of 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Depending on the clinical situation, the initial starting dose may be lowered in patients who are opioid na\u00efve. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose \u200eof Hydromorphone \u200eHydrochloride Injection.\u200e Intravenous Administration Initiate treatment in a dosing range of 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary for pain control, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Intravenous administration should be given slowly, over at least 2 to 3 minutes, depending on the dose. Titrate the dose to achieve acceptable pain management and tolerable adverse events. The initial dose should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated and may be lowered to 0.2 mg. Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. If the decision is made to convert to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection from another opioid analgesic using publicly available data, convert the current total daily amount(s) of opioid(s) received to an equivalent total daily dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and reduce by one-half due to the possibility of incomplete cross tolerance. Divide the new total amount by the number of doses permitted based on dosing interval (e.g., 8 doses for every-three-hour dosing). Titrate the dose according to the patient's response. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Start patients with hepatic impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection depending on the extent of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection depending on the degree of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Individually titrate Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.12) ] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.6 Safe Reduction and Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection When a patient who has been taking Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patient s who may be physically dependent on opioids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia : Opioid-Induced \u200eHyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic \u200eparadoxically causes an \u200eincrease in pain, or an increase in \u200esensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately \u200e\u200edecreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic, or \u200eopioid rotation. ( 5.5 )\u200e \u2022 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Adrenal Insufficiency : If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Severe Hypotension : Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection contains hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. The risk of opioid-related overdose or overdose-related death is increased with higher opioid doses, and this risk persists over the course of therapy. In postmarketing studies, addiction, abuse, misuse, and fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose were observed in patients with long-term opioid use [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, and monitor all patients receiving Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from \u200elegitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid overdose reversal agent (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene) , depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10) ] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Overestimating the Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non\u2011benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids [gabapentin or pregabalin], and other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.5 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic \u200eparadoxically causes an increase in pain, or an \u200eincrease in sensitivity to pain. \u200eThis condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of \u200eopioids to \u200emaintain a defined effect [ Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] . Symptoms of OIH \u200einclude (but may not be limited to) increased levels \u200eof pain upon opioid dosage \u200eincrease, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from \u200eordinarily non\u2011\u200epainful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only \u200eif there is no evidence of underlying disease \u200eprogression, opioid tolerance, \u200eopioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.\u200e Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of \u200eopioid analgesics. Though the \u200emechanism of OIH is not fully understood, \u200emultiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature \u200esuggests \u200ea strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a \u200epatient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, \u200ecarefully consider appropriately \u200edecreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely \u200eswitching \u200ethe patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and \u200eAdministration (2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] .\u200e 5.6 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.7 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.8 Severe Hypotension Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. In patients with circulatory shock, Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patients with circulatory shock. 5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for worsening of signs of increasing intracranial pressure. Monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.10 Risks of Gastrointestinal Complications Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Cases of opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED) have been reported in patients taking opioids. The risk of OIED may increase as the dose and/or duration of opioids increases. Regularly evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of OIED (e.g., dysphagia, regurgitation, non-cardiac chest pain) and, if necessary, adjust opioid therapy as clinically appropriate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 5.11 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection therapy. 5.12 Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . When discontinuing Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in these patients [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] . 5.13 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and know how they will react to the medication. 5.14 Increased Risk of Hypotension and Respiratory Depression with Rapid Intravenous Administration Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection may be given intravenously, but the injection should be given very slowly. Rapid intravenous injection of opioid analgesics increases the possibility of side effects such as hypotension and respiratory depression [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: \u2022 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Interactions with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Severe Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] \u2022 Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] \u2022 Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of hydromorphone were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most common adverse effects are light-headedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Most common adverse reactions are light-headedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. Serious adverse reactions include respiratory depression and apnea, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock and cardiac arrest.

Adverse Reactions from Observational Studies A prospective, observational cohort study estimated the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse in patients initiating long-term use of Schedule II opioid analgesics between 2017 and 2021. Study participants included in one or more analyses had been enrolled in selected insurance plans or health systems for at least one year, were free of at least one outcome at baseline, completed a minimum number of follow-up assessments, and either: 1) filled multiple extended-release/long-acting opioid analgesic prescriptions during a 90-day period (n=978); or 2) filled any Schedule II opioid analgesic prescriptions covering at least 70 of 90 days (n=1,244). Those included also had no dispensing of the qualifying opioids in the previous 6 months. Over 12 months: \u2022 approximately 1% to 6% of participants across the two cohorts newly met criteria for addiction, as assessed with two validated interview-based measures of moderate-to-severe opioid use disorder based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria, and \u2022 approximately 9% and 22% of participants across the two cohorts newly met criteria for prescription opioid abuse and misuse [defined in Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2) ] , respectively, as measured with a validated self-reported instrument. A retrospective, observational cohort study estimated the risk of opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose\u2011related death in patients with new long-term use of Schedule II opioid analgesics from 2006 through 2016 (n=220,249). Included patients had been enrolled in either one of two commercial insurance programs, one managed care program, or one Medicaid program for at least 9 months. New long-term use was defined as having Schedule II opioid analgesic prescriptions covering at least 70 days\u2019 supply over the 3 months prior to study entry and none during the preceding 6 months. Patients were excluded if they had an opioid-involved overdose in the 9 months prior to study entry. Overdose was measured using a validated medical code-based algorithm with linkage to the National Death Index database. The 5-year cumulative incidence estimates for opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death ranged from approximately 1.5% to 4% across study sites, counting only the first event during follow-up. Approximately 17% of first opioid overdoses observed over the entire study period (5-11 years, depending on the study site) were fatal. Higher baseline opioid dose was the strongest and most consistent predictor of opioid-involved overdose or opioid overdose-related death. Study exclusion criteria may have selected patients at lower risk of overdose, and substantial loss to follow-up (approximately 80%) also may have biased estimates. The risk estimates from the studies described above may not be generalizable to all patients receiving opioid analgesics, such as those with exposures shorter or longer than the duration evaluated in the studies."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Monitor patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation. Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids (gabapentin or pregabalin), other opioids, alcohol. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Intervention: The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Examples: cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. \u2022 Serotonergic Drugs : Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) \u2022 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) : Can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. ( 7 ) \u2022 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics : Avoid use with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection because they may reduce analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

There are no available data with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes\u200e.\u200e There are adverse outcomes reported with fetal exposure to opioid analgesics [see Clinical Considerations ] . In published animal reproduction studies, neural tube defects were noted following subcutaneous injection of hydromorphone to pregnant hamsters at doses 6.4 times the HDD and soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities were noted following subcutaneous continuous infusion of 3 times the HDD to pregnant mice. No malformations were noted at 4 or 40.5 times the HDD in pregnant rats or rabbits, respectively [see Data ] . Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid overdose reversal agent, such as naloxone or nalmefene, must be available for reversal of opioid\u2011induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data No effects on teratogenicity or embryotoxicity were observed in pregnant rats given oral doses up to 7 mg/kg/day which is 3-fold higher than the human dose of 24 mg Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection (4 mg every 4 hours), on a body surface area basis. In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day). In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection in pediatric patients has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one fourth to one half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated \"loss\" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider(s). \"Doctor shopping\" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.

The risk is increased with concurrent use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to \u200ea drug after repeated administration (i.e., a \u200ehigher \u200edose of a drug is \u200erequired to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower \u200edose).\u200e Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological \u200eadaptation in response to repeated drug use, \u200emanifested \u200eby withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection should not be rapidly reduced or abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. If Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is rapidly reduced or abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur, typically \u200echaracterized by restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with hydromorphone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Toxic leukoencephalopathy has been reported after opioid overdose and can present hours, days, or weeks after apparent recovery from the initial intoxication. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose, administer an opioid overdose reversal agent such as naloxone or nalmefene. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid overdose reversal agent is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional reversal agent as directed by the product's prescribing information. In an individual physically-dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the opioid overdose reversal agent will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the reversal agent administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically-dependent patient, administration of the reversal agent should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the reversal agent."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the m\u00b5-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, transient elevations in serum amylase, and opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED). Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.5) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8\u201319% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume of distribution [mean (%CV)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC \u221e ) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one fourth to one half the recommended starting dose and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone following an oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets) are affected by renal impairment. Mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0\u2013\u221e ) is increased by 2-fold in patients with moderate (CLcr = 40 \u2013 60 mL/min) renal impairment and increased by 4-fold in patients with severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have a higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0\u201324 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."

The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, transient elevations in serum amylase, and opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED). Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.5) ] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5) ] ."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8\u201319% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume of distribution [mean (%CV)] is 302.9 (32%) liters. Elimination The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours. Metabolism Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Excretion Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment After oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC \u221e ) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one fourth to one half the recommended starting dose and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C max and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone following an oral administration of hydromorphone at a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets) are affected by renal impairment. Mean exposure to hydromorphone (C max and AUC 0\u2013\u221e ) is increased by 2-fold in patients with moderate (CLcr = 40 \u2013 60 mL/min) renal impairment and increased by 4-fold in patients with severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Age: Geriatric Population In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Sex Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have a higher C max (25%) than males with comparable AUC 0\u201324 values. The difference observed in C max may not be clinically relevant."
