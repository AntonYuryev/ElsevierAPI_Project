      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Mesna injection may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of three bolus intravenous injections or a single bolus injection followed by two oral administrations of mesna tablets as outlined below. The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is adjusted, the ratio of mesna to ifosfamide should be maintained. ( 2 ) Intravenous Dosing Schedule: 0 Hours 4 Hours 8 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 - - Mesna injection 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 Intravenous and Oral Dosing Schedule: 0 Hours 2 Hours 6 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 - - Mesna injection 240 mg/m 2 - - Mesna tablets - 480 mg/m 2 480 mg/m 2 Maintain sufficient urinary output, as required for ifosfamide treatment, and monitor urine for the presence of hematuria. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Intravenous Dosing Mesna injection may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of three bolus intravenous injections as outlined below. Mesna injection is given as intravenous bolus injections in a dosage equal to 20% of the ifosfamide dosage weight by weight (w/w) at the time of ifosfamide administration and 4 and 8 hours after each dose of ifosfamide. The total daily dose of mesna injection is 60% of the ifosfamide dose. The recommended dosing schedule is outlined below in Table 1 . Table 1. Recommended Intravenous Dosing Schedule 1 The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is increased or decreased, the ratio of mesna to ifosfamide should be maintained. 0 Hours 4 Hours 8 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 - - Mesna injection 1 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 2.2 Intravenous and Oral Dosing Mesna injection may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of a single bolus injection followed by two oral administrations of mesna tablets as outlined below. Mesna injection is given as intravenous bolus injections in a dosage equal to 20% of the ifosfamide dosage (w/w) at the time of ifosfamide administration. Mesna tablets are given orally in a dosage equal to 40% of the ifosfamide dose 2 and 6 hours after each dose of ifosfamide. The total daily dose of mesna is 100% of the ifosfamide dose. The recommended dosing schedule is outlined in Table 2 . Table 2. Recommended Intravenous and Oral Dosing Schedule 1 The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is increased or decreased, the ratio of mesna to ifosfamide should be maintained. 0 Hours 2 Hours 6 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 - - Mesna injection 1 240 mg/m 2 - - Mesna tablets - 480 mg/m 2 480 mg/m 2 The efficacy and safety of this ratio of intravenous and oral mesna has not been established as being effective for daily doses of ifosfamide higher than 2 g/m 2 . Patients who vomit within two hours of taking oral mesna should repeat the dose or receive intravenous mesna injection. 2.3 Monitoring for Hematuria Maintain adequate hydration and sufficient urinary output, as required for ifosfamide treatment, and monitor urine for the presence of hematuria. If severe hematuria develops when mesna injection is given according to the recommended dosage schedule, dosage reductions or discontinuation of ifosfamide therapy may be required. 2.4 Preparation for Intravenous Administration and Stability Preparation Determine the volume of mesna injection for the intended dose. Dilute the volume of mesna injection for the dose in any of the following fluids to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg per mL: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP 5% Dextrose and 0.2% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 5% Dextrose and 0.33% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP Stability The mesna injection multidose vials may be stored and used for up to 8 days after initial puncture. Store diluted solutions at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). Use diluted solutions within 24 hours. Do not mix mesna injection with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, and nitrogen mustard. The benzyl alcohol contained in mesna injection vials can reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Ifosfamide and mesna injection may be mixed in the same bag provided the final concentration of ifosfamide does not exceed 50 mg per mL. Higher concentrations of ifosfamide may not be compatible with mesna injection and may reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Any solutions which are discolored, hazy, or contain visible particulate matter should not be used."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Less severe hypersensitivity reactions may also occur. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. ( 5.1 ) Dermatologic toxicity: Skin rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Skin rash, urticaria, and angioedema have also been seen. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. ( 5.2 ) Benzyl alcohol toxicity: Serious and fatal adverse reactions can occur in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including mesna injection. Avoid use in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. ( 5.3 ) Laboratory test alterations: False positive tests for urinary ketones and interference with enzymatic CPK activity tests have been seen. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Mesna may cause systemic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. These reactions may include fever, cardiovascular symptoms (hypotension, tachycardia), acute renal impairment, hypoxia, respiratory distress, urticaria, angioedema, laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, hematological abnormalities, increased liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and myalgia. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Monitor for signs or symptoms. Discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. 5.2 Dermatologic Toxicity Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and bullous and ulcerative skin and mucosal reactions, consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Mesna may cause skin and mucosal reactions characterized by urticaria, rash, erythema, pruritus, burning sensation, angioedema, periorbital edema, flushing and stomatitis. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. 5.3 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants who received benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Symptoms associated with \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d and other potential adverse reactions include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematological abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Premature neonates and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Mesna injection contains 10.4 mg/mL of the preservative benzyl alcohol. Avoid use of mesna injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. Mesna tablets do not contain benzyl alcohol [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.4 Laboratory Test Interferences False-Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with mesna when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies). False-Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity Mesna may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g., N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactivation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level. False-Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid Mesna may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman's reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds Mesna is a thiol compound, i.e., a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to mesna."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling. Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Dermatological Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Laboratory Test Interferences [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] The most common adverse reactions (> 10%) when mesna is given with ifosfamide are nausea, vomiting, constipation, leukopenia, fatigue, fever, anorexia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, granulocytopenia, diarrhea, asthenia, abdominal pain, headache, alopecia, and somnolence. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Mesna adverse reaction data are available from four Phase 1 studies in which single intravenous doses of 600 to 1200 mg mesna injection without concurrent chemotherapy were administered to a total of 53 healthy volunteers. The most frequently reported side effects (observed in two or more healthy volunteers) for healthy volunteers receiving single doses of mesna injection alone were headache, injection site reactions, flushing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, diarrhea, anorexia, fever, pharyngitis, hyperesthesia, influenza-like symptoms, and coughing. In two Phase 1 multiple-dose studies where healthy volunteers received mesna tablets alone or intravenous mesna followed by repeated doses of mesna tablets, flatulence and rhinitis were reported. In addition, constipation was reported by healthy volunteers who had received repeated doses of intravenous mesna. Additional adverse reactions in healthy volunteers receiving mesna alone included injection site reactions, abdominal pain/colic, epigastric pain/burning, mucosal irritation, lightheadedness, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, rigors, paresthesia, photophobia, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, extremity pain, malaise, chest pain, dysuria, pleuritic pain, dry mouth, dyspnea, and hyperhidrosis. In healthy volunteers, mesna was commonly associated with a rapid (within 24 hours) decrease in lymphocyte count, which was generally reversible within one week of administration. Because mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing chemotherapy regimens, it is difficult to distinguish the adverse reactions which may be due to mesna from those caused by the concomitantly administered cytotoxic agents. Adverse reactions reasonably associated with mesna administered intravenously and orally in four controlled studies in which patients received ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing regimens are presented in Table 3 . Table 3: Adverse Reactions in \u22655% of Patients Receiving Mesna in combination with Ifosfamide-containing Regimens 1 Intravenous dosing of ifosfamide and mesna followed by either intravenous or oral doses of mesna according to the applicable dosage schedule [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )].

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Mesna in combination with ifosfamide can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Do not breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise patients to use effective contraception. Verify pregnancy status prior to initiation of mesna in combination with ifosfamide. ( 8.3 ) Pediatric use: In premature neonates and low-birth weight infants, avoid use of benzyl alcohol\u2013containing solutions. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Dose selection should be cautious. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm including embryo-fetal lethality. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. In embryo-fetal development studies, oral administration of mesna to pregnant rats (500, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 mg/kg) and rabbits (500 and 1,000 mg/kg) during the period of organogenesis revealed no adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended total daily human equivalent dose based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide is excreted in breast milk. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during lactation. There are no data on the presence of mesna in human or animal milk, the effect on the breastfed child, or the effect on milk production. Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a lactating woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the breastfed infant is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of mesna or ifosfamide. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on contraception and effects on fertility. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of mesna in combination with ifosfamide. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mesna in combination with ifosfamide and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mesna in combination with ifosfamide and for 3 months after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol which has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death when administered intravenously to premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. Avoid use of mesna injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesna did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. The ratio of ifosfamide to mesna should remain unchanged. 8.6 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna. 8.7 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mesna reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites, acrolein and 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide, resulting in their detoxification. The first step in the detoxification process is the binding of mesna to 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide forming a non-urotoxic 4-sulfoethylthioifosfamide. Mesna also binds to the double bonds of acrolein and to other urotoxic metabolites and inhibits their effects on the bladder. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration, peak plasma concentrations were reached within 1.5 to 4 hours and 3 to 7 hours for free mesna and total mesna (mesna plus dimesna and mixed disulfides), respectively. Oral bioavailability averaged 58% (range 45 to 71%) for free mesna and 89% (range 74 to 104%) for total mesna based on plasma AUC data from 8 healthy volunteers who received 1200 mg oral or intravenous doses. Food does not affect the urinary availability of orally administered mesna. Distribution Mean apparent volume of distribution (V d ) for mesna is 0.652 \u00b1 0.242 L/kg after intravenous administration which suggests distribution to total body water (plasma, extracellular fluid, and intracellular water). Metabolism Analogous to the physiological cysteine-cystine system, mesna is rapidly oxidized to its major metabolite, mesna disulfide (dimesna). Plasma concentrations of mesna exceed those of dimesna after oral or intravenous administration. Excretion Following intravenous administration of a single 800 mg dose, approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and dimesna, respectively. Mean plasma elimination half-lives of mesna and dimesna are 0.36 hours and 1.17 hours, respectively. Mesna has a plasma clearance of 1.23 L/h/kg."

At a dose of 1.2 g/m 2 ifosfamide administered daily for 5 days, 16 to 26% of the patients who received conventional uroprophylaxis (high fluid intake, alkalinization of the urine, and the administration of diuretics) developed hematuria (>50 RBC per hpf or macrohematuria) (Studies 1, 2, and 3). In contrast, none of the patients who received mesna injection together with this dose of ifosfamide developed hematuria (Studies 3 and 4). In two randomized studies, (Studies 5 and 6), higher doses of ifosfamide, from 2 g/m 2 to 4 g/m 2 administered for 3 to 5 days, produced hematuria in 31 to 100% of the patients.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Mesna injection may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of three bolus intravenous injections or a single bolus injection followed by two oral administrations of MESNEX tablets as outlined below. The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is adjusted, the ratio of mesna to ifosfamide should be maintained. ( 2 ) Intravenous Dosing Schedule: 0 Hours 4 Hours 8 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 -- -- Mesna injection 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 Intravenous and Oral Dosing Schedule: 0 Hours 2 Hours 6 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 -- -- Mesna injection 240 mg/m 2 -- -- MESNEX tablets -- 480 mg/m 2 480 mg/m 2 Maintain sufficient urinary output, as required for ifosfamide treatment, and monitor urine for the presence of hematuria. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Intravenous Dosing Mesna injection may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of three bolus intravenous injections as outlined below. Mesna injection is given as intravenous bolus injections in a dosage equal to 20% of the ifosfamide dosage weight by weight (w/w) at the time of ifosfamide administration and 4 and 8 hours after each dose of ifosfamide. The total daily dose of mesna injection is 60% of the ifosfamide dose. The recommended dosing schedule is outlined below in Table 1 . Table 1. Recommended Intravenous Dosing Schedule 1 The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is increased or decreased, the ratio of mesna to ifosfamide should be maintained. 0 Hours 4 Hours 8 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 - - Mesna injection 1 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 2.2 Intravenous and Oral Dosing Mesna injection may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of a single bolus injection followed by two oral administrations of MESNEX tablets as outlined below. Mesna injection is given as intravenous bolus injections in a dosage equal to 20% of the ifosfamide dosage (w/w) at the time of ifosfamide administration. MESNEX tablets are given orally in a dosage equal to 40% of the ifosfamide dose 2 and 6 hours after each dose of ifosfamide. The total daily dose of mesna is 100% of the ifosfamide dose. The recommended dosing schedule is outlined in Table 2 . Table 2. Recommended Intravenous and Oral Dosing Schedule 1 The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is increased or decreased, the ratio of mesna to ifosfamide should be maintained. 0 Hours 2 Hours 6 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 - - Mesna injection 1 240 mg/m 2 - - MESNEX tablets - 480 mg/m 2 480 mg/m 2 The efficacy and safety of this ratio of intravenous and oral MESNEX has not been established as being effective for daily doses of ifosfamide higher than 2 g/m 2 . Patients who vomit within two hours of taking oral MESNEX should repeat the dose or receive intravenous mesna injection. 2.3 Monitoring for Hematuria Maintain adequate hydration and sufficient urinary output, as required for ifosfamide treatment, and monitor urine for the presence of hematuria. If severe hematuria develops when mesna injection is given according to the recommended dosage schedule, dosage reductions or discontinuation of ifosfamide therapy may be required. 2.4 Preparation for Intravenous Administration and Stability Preparation Determine the volume of mesna injection for the intended dose. Dilute the volume of mesna injection for the dose in any of the following fluids to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/mL: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP 5% Dextrose and 0.2% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 5% Dextrose and 0.33% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP Stability The mesna injection multidose vials may be stored and used for up to 8 days after initial puncture. Store diluted solutions at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). Use diluted solutions within 24 hours. Do not mix mesna injection with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, and nitrogen mustard. The benzyl alcohol contained in mesna injection vials can reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Ifosfamide and mesna injection may be mixed in the same bag provided the final concentration of ifosfamide does not exceed 50 mg/mL. Higher concentrations of ifosfamide may not be compatible with mesna injection and may reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Any solutions which are discolored, hazy, or contain visible particulate matter should not be used."

      "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Less severe hypersensitivity reactions may also occur. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna injection and provide supportive care. ( 5.1 ) Dermatologic toxicity: Skin rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Skin rash, urticaria, and angioedema have also been seen. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna injection and provide supportive care. ( 5.2 ) Benzyl alcohol toxicity: Serious and fatal adverse reactions can occur in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including mesna injection. Avoid use in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. ( 5.3 ) Laboratory test alterations: False positive tests for urinary ketones and interference with enzymatic CPK activity tests have been seen. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Mesna injection may cause systemic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. These reactions may include fever, cardiovascular symptoms (hypotension, tachycardia), acute renal impairment, hypoxia, respiratory distress, urticaria, angioedema, laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, hematological abnormalities, increased liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and myalgia. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Monitor for signs or symptoms. Discontinue mesna injection and provide supportive care. 5.2 Dermatologic Toxicity Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and bullous and ulcerative skin and mucosal reactions, consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Mesna injection may cause skin and mucosal reactions characterized by urticaria, rash, erythema, pruritus, burning sensation, angioedema, periorbital edema, flushing and stomatitis. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Discontinue mesna injection and provide supportive care. 5.3 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants who received benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Symptoms associated with \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d and other potential adverse reactions include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematological abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Premature neonates and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Mesna injection contains 10.4 mg/mL of the preservative benzyl alcohol. Avoid use of mesna injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. MESNEX tablets do not contain benzyl alcohol [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.4 Laboratory Test Interferences False-Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with mesna when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies). False-Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity Mesna may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g., N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactiviation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level. False-Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid Mesna may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman\u2019s reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds Mesna is a thiol compound, i.e., a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to mesna."

      "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling. Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dermatological Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Laboratory Test Interferences [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The most common adverse reactions (> 10%) when mesna injection is given with ifosfamide are nausea, vomiting, constipation, leukopenia, fatigue, fever, anorexia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, granulocytopenia, diarrhea, asthenia, abdominal pain, headache, alopecia, and somnolence. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eugia US LLC at 1-866-850-2876, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Mesna injection adverse reaction data are available from four Phase 1 studies in which single intravenous doses of 600 to 1,200 mg mesna injection without concurrent chemotherapy were administered to a total of 53 healthy volunteers and single oral doses of 600 to 2,400 mg of MESNEX tablets were administered to a total of 82 healthy volunteers. The most frequently reported side effects (observed in two or more healthy volunteers) for healthy volunteers receiving single doses of mesna injection alone were headache, injection site reactions, flushing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, diarrhea, anorexia, fever, pharyngitis, hyperesthesia, influenza-like symptoms, and coughing. In two Phase 1 multiple-dose studies where healthy volunteers received MESNEX tablets alone or intravenous mesna followed by repeated doses of MESNEX tablets, flatulence and rhinitis were reported. In addition, constipation was reported by healthy volunteers who had received repeated doses of intravenous mesna injection. Additional adverse reactions in healthy volunteers receiving mesna injection alone included injection site reactions, abdominal pain/colic, epigastric pain/burning, mucosal irritation, lightheadedness, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, rigors, paresthesia, photophobia, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, extremity pain, malaise, chest pain, dysuria, pleuritic pain, dry mouth, dyspnea, and hyperhidrosis. In healthy volunteers, mesna was commonly associated with a rapid (within 24 hours) decrease in lymphocyte count, which was generally reversible within one week of administration. Because mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing chemotherapy regimens, it is difficult to distinguish the adverse reactions which may be due to mesna from those caused by the concomitantly administered cytotoxic agents. Adverse reactions reasonably associated with mesna administered intravenously and orally in four controlled studies in which patients received ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing regimens are presented in Table 3 .

( 8.1 ) \u2022 Lactation: Do not breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) \u2022 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise patients to use effective contraception. Verify pregnancy status prior to initiation of mesna injection in combination with ifosfamide. ( 8.3 ) \u2022 Pediatric use: In premature neonates and low-birth weight infants, avoid use of benzyl alcohol\u2013containing solutions. ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric use: Dose selection should be cautious. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mesna injection is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Mesna injection is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm including embryo-fetal lethality. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. In embryo-fetal development studies, oral administration of mesna to pregnant rats (500, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 mg/kg) and rabbits (500 and 1,000 mg/kg) during the period of organogenesis revealed no adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended total daily human equivalent dose based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesna injection is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide is excreted in breast milk. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during lactation. There are no data on the presence of mesna in human or animal milk, the effect on the breastfed child, or the effect on milk production. Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a lactating woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the breastfed infant is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of mesna or ifosfamide. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Mesna injection is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on contraception and effects on fertility. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of mesna injection in combination with ifosfamide. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mesna injection in combination with ifosfamide and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mesna injection in combination with ifosfamide and for 3 months after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol which has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death when administered intravenously to premature neonates and low birth weight infants. Avoid use of mesna injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesna injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. The ratio of ifosfamide to mesna should remain unchanged. 8.6 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna injection. 8.7 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna injection."

      "11. DESCRIPTION Mesna injection is a detoxifying agent to inhibit the hemorrhagic cystitis induced by ifosfamide. The active ingredient, mesna, USP is a synthetic sulfhydryl compound designated as sodium-2- sulphanylethanesulphonate with a molecular formula of C 2 H 5 NaO 3 S 2 and a molecular weight of 164.2. Its structural formula is as follows: HS\u2013CH 2 \u2013CH 2 SO 3 \u2013Na + Mesna injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, aqueous solution of clear and colorless appearance in clear glass multiple-dose vials for intravenous administration. Mesna injection contains 100 mg/mL mesna, USP, 0.25 mg/mL edetate disodium and sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. Mesna injection multiple-dose vials also contain 10.4 mg/mL of benzyl alcohol as a preservative. The solution has a pH range between 7.5 and 8.5."

      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mesna reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites, acrolein and 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide, resulting in their detoxification. The first step in the detoxification process is the binding of mesna to 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide forming a non-urotoxic 4-sulfoethylthioifosfamide. Mesna also binds to the double bonds of acrolein and to other urotoxic metabolites and inhibits their effects on the bladder. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration, peak plasma concentrations were reached within 1.5 to 4 hours and 3 to 7 hours for free mesna and total mesna (mesna plus dimesna and mixed disulfides), respectively. Oral bioavailability averaged 58% (range 45 to 71%) for free mesna and 89% (range 74 to 104%) for total mesna based on plasma AUC data from 8 healthy volunteers who received 1,200 mg oral or intravenous doses. Food does not affect the urinary availability of orally administered mesna. Distribution Mean apparent volume of distribution (V d ) for mesna is 0.652 \u00b1 0.242 L/kg after intravenous administration which suggests distribution to total body water (plasma, extracellular fluid, and intracellular water). Metabolism Analogous to the physiological cysteine-cystine system, mesna is rapidly oxidized to its major metabolite, mesna disulfide (dimesna). Plasma concentrations of mesna exceed those of dimesna after oral or intravenous administration. Excretion Following intravenous administration of a single 800 mg dose, approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and dimesna, respectively. Mean plasma elimination half-lives of mesna and dimesna are 0.36 hours and 1.17 hours, respectively. Mesna has a plasma clearance of 1.23 L/h/kg."

Excretion Following intravenous administration of a single 800 mg dose, approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and dimesna, respectively. Mean plasma elimination half-lives of mesna and dimesna are 0.36 hours and 1.17 hours, respectively. Mesna has a plasma clearance of 1.23 L/h/kg."

      "14. CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Intravenous Mesna Injection Hemorrhagic cystitis produced by ifosfamide is dose dependent ( Table 4 ). At a dose of 1.2 g/m 2 ifosfamide administered daily for 5 days, 16 to 26% of the patients who received conventional uroprophylaxis (high fluid intake, alkalinization of the urine, and the administration of diuretics) developed hematuria (>50 RBC per hpf or macrohematuria) (Studies 1, 2, and 3). In contrast, none of the patients who received mesna injection together with this dose of ifosfamide developed hematuria (Studies 3 and 4). In two randomized studies, (Studies 5 and 6), higher doses of ifosfamide, from 2 g/m 2 to 4 g/m 2 administered for 3 to 5 days, produced hematuria in 31 to 100% of the patients. When mesna injection was administered together with these doses of ifosfamide, the incidence of hematuria was less than 7%. Table 4.

Study 7 was an open label, randomized, two-way crossover study comparing three intravenous doses with an initial intravenous dose followed by two oral doses of MESNEX in patients with cancer treated with ifosfamide at a dose of 1.2 g/m 2 to 2.0 g/m 2 for 3 to 5 days. Study 8 was a randomized, multicenter study in cancer patients receiving ifosfamide at 2.0 g/m 2 for 5 days. In both studies, development of grade 3 or 4 hematuria was the primary efficacy endpoint.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Mesna may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of three bolus intravenous injections. The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is adjusted, the ratio of mesna to ifosfamide should be maintained. ( 2 ) Intravenous Dosing Schedule: 0 Hours 4 Hours 8 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 -\u2011 -\u2011 Mesna Injection 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 Maintain sufficient urinary output, as required for ifosfamide treatment, and monitor urine for the presence of hematuria. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Intravenous Dosing Mesna may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of three bolus intravenous injections as outlined below. Mesna injection is given as intravenous bolus injections in a dosage equal to 20% of the ifosfamide dosage weight by weight (w/w) at the time of ifosfamide administration and 4 and 8 hours after each dose of ifosfamide. The total daily dose of mesna is 60% of the ifosfamide dose. The recommended dosing schedule is outlined below in Table 1 . T able 1. Recommended Intravenous Dosing Schedule 0 Hours 4 Hours 8 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 - - Mesna Injection 1 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 1 The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is increased or decreased, the ratio of mesna to ifosfamide should be maintained. 2.3 Monitoring for Hematuria Maintain adequate hydration and sufficient urinary output, as required for ifosfamide treatment, and monitor urine for the presence of hematuria. If severe hematuria develops when mesna is given according to the recommended dosage schedule, dosage reductions or discontinuation of ifosfamide therapy may be required. 2.4 Preparation for Intravenous Administrationand Stability P re paration Determine the volume of mesna injection for the intended dose. Dilute the volume of mesna injection for the dose in any of the following fluids to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/mL: \u2022 5% Dextrose Injection, USP \u2022 5% Dextrose and 0.2% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 5% Dextrose and 0.33% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP S tability The mesna injection multiple-dose vials may be stored and used for up to 8 days after initial puncture. Store diluted solutions at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). Use diluted solutions within 24 hours. Do not mix mesna injection with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, and nitrogen mustard. The benzyl alcohol contained in mesna injection vials can reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Ifosfamide and mesna may be mixed in the same bag provided the final concentration of ifosfamide does not exceed 50 mg/mL. Higher concentrations of ifosfamide may not be compatible with mesna and may reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Any solutions which are discolored, hazy, or contain visible particulate matter should not be used."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Less severe hypersensitivity reactions may also occur. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. ( 5.1 ) Dermatologic toxicity: Skin rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Skin rash, urticaria, and angioedema have also been seen. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. ( 5.2 ) Benzyl alcohol toxicity: Serious and fatal adverse reactions can occur in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including mesna injection. Avoid use in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. ( 5.3 ) Laboratory test alterations: False positive tests for urinary ketones and interference with enzymatic CPK activity tests have been seen. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Mesna may cause systemic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. These reactions may include fever, cardiovascular symptoms (hypotension, tachycardia), acute renal impairment, hypoxia, respiratory distress, urticaria, angioedema, laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, hematological abnormalities, increased liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and myalgia. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Monitor for signs or symptoms. Discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. 5.2 Dermatologic Toxicity Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and bullous and ulcerative skin and mucosal reactions, consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Mesna may cause skin and mucosal reactions characterized by urticaria, rash, erythema, pruritus, burning sensation, angioedema, periorbital edema, flushing and stomatitis. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. 5.3 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants who received benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Symptoms associated with \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d and other potential adverse reactions include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematological abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Premature neonates and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Mesna injection contains 10.4 mg/mL of the preservative benzyl alcohol. Avoid use of mesna injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.4 Laboratory Test Interferences False-Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with mesna when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies). False-Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity Mesna may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g., N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactiviation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level. False-Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid Mesna may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman\u2019s reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds Mesna is a thiol compound, i.e., a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to mesna."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling. \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Dermatological Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 )] \u2022 Laboratory Test Interferences [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] The most common adverse reactions (> 10%) when mesna is given with ifosfamide are nausea, vomiting, constipation, leukopenia, fatigue, fever, anorexia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, granulocytopenia, diarrhea, asthenia, abdominal pain, headache, alopecia, and somnolence. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-845-0689 or FDA at 1-800-332-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. \"1-800-FDA-1088\" 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Mesna adverse reaction data are available from four Phase 1 studies in which single intravenous doses of 600-1200 mg mesna Injection without concurrent chemotherapy were administered to a total of 53 healthy volunteers. The most frequently reported side effects (observed in two or more healthy volunteers) for healthy volunteers receiving single doses of mesna Injection alone were headache, injection site reactions, flushing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, diarrhea, anorexia, fever, pharyngitis, hyperesthesia, influenza-like symptoms, and coughing. In addition, constipation was reported by healthy volunteers who had received repeated doses of intravenous mesna. Additional adverse reactions in healthy volunteers receiving mesna alone included injection site reactions, abdominal pain/colic, epigastric pain/burning, mucosal irritation, lightheadedness, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, rigors, paresthesia, photophobia, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, extremity pain, malaise, chest pain, dysuria, pleuritic pain, dry mouth, dyspnea, and hyperhidrosis. In healthy volunteers, mesna was commonly associated with a rapid (within 24 hours) decrease in lymphocyte count, which was generally reversible within one week of administration. Because mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing chemotherapy regimens, it is difficult to distinguish the adverse reactions which may be due to mesna from those caused by the concomitantly administered cytotoxic agents. Adverse reactions reasonably associated with mesna administered intravenously in four controlled studies in which patients received ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing regimens are presented in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Reactions in \u22655% of Patients Receiving Mesna in combination with Ifosfamide-containing Regimens Mesna Regimen I ntravenous-Intravenous-Intravenous 1 N exposed 119 (100%) Incidence of AEs 101 (84.9%) Nausea 65 (54.6) Vomiting 35 (29.4) Constipation 28 (23.5) Leukopenia 25 (21) Fatigue 24 (20.2) Fever 24 (20.2) Anorexia 21 (17.6) Thrombocytopenia 21 (17.6) Anemia 20 (16.8) Granulocytopenia 16 (13.4) Asthenia 15 (12.6) Abdominal Pain 14 (11.8) Alopecia 12 (10.1) Dyspnea 11 (9.2) Chest Pain 10 (8.4) Hypokalemia 10 (8.4) Diarrhea 9 (7.6) Dizziness 9 (7.6) Headache 9 (7.6) Pain 9 (7.6) Sweating Increased 9 (7.6) Back Pain 8 (6.7) Hematuria 8 (6.7) Injection Site Reaction 8 (6.7) Edema 8 (6.7) Edema Peripheral 8 (6.7) Somnolence 8 (6.7) Anxiety 7 (5.9) Confusion 7 (5.9) Face Edema 6 (5) Insomnia 6 (5) Coughing 5 (4.2) Dyspepsia 4 (3.4) Hypotension 4 (3.4) Pallor 4 (3.4) Dehydration 3 (2.5) Pneumonia 2 (1.7) Tachycardia 1 (0.8) Flushing 1 (0.8) 1 Intravenous dosing of ifosfamide and mesna followed by intravenous doses of mesna according to the applicable dosage schedule. [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported in the postmarketing experience of patients receiving mesna in combination with ifosfamide or similar drugs, making it difficult to distinguish the adverse reactions which may be due to mesna from those caused by the concomitantly administered cytotoxic agents. Because these reactions are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Mesna injection in combination with ifosfamide can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus. (8.1) Lactation: Do not breastfeed. (8.2) Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise patients to use effective contraception. Verify pregnancy status prior to initiation of mesna in combination with ifosfamide. (8.3) Pediatric use: In premature neonates and low-birth weight infants, avoid use of benzyl alcohol\u2013containing solutions. (8.4) Geriatric use: Dose selection should be cautious. (8.5) S e e 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4 )]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm including embryo-fetal lethality. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. In embryo-fetal development studies, oral administration of mesna to pregnant rats (500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg/kg) and rabbits (500 and 1000 mg/kg) during the period of organogenesis revealed no adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended total daily human equivalent dose based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide is excreted in breast milk. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during lactation. There are no data on the presence of mesna in human or animal milk, the effect on the breastfed child, or the effect on milk production. Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a lactating woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the breastfed infant is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4 )]. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of mesna or ifosfamide. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on contraception and effects on fertility. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of mesna in combination with ifosfamide. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mesna in combination with ifosfamide and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mesna in combination with ifosfamide and for 3 months after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use Mesna Injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol which has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death when administered intravenously to premature neonates and low birth weight infants. Avoid use of mesna injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesna did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. The ratio of ifosfamide to mesna should remain unchanged. 8.6 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna. 8.7 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4 )]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm including embryo-fetal lethality. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. In embryo-fetal development studies, oral administration of mesna to pregnant rats (500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg/kg) and rabbits (500 and 1000 mg/kg) during the period of organogenesis revealed no adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended total daily human equivalent dose based on body surface area."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Mesna is a detoxifying agent to inhibit the hemorrhagic cystitis induced by ifosfamide. The active ingredient, mesna, is a synthetic sulfhydryl compound designated as sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulfonate with a molecular formula of C 2 H 5 NaO 3 S 2 and a molecular weight of 164.18. Its structural formula is as follows: HS\u2013CH2\u2013CH2SO3\u2013Na+ Mesna injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, aqueous solution of clear and colorless appearance in clear glass Multiple-Dose vials for intravenous administration. Mesna injection contains 100 mg/mL mesna, 0.25 mg/mL edetate disodium and sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. Mesna Injection Multiple-Dose vials also contain 10.4 mg/mL of benzyl alcohol as a preservative. The solution has a pH range of 6.5 to 7.3."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mesna reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites, acrolein and 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide, resulting in their detoxification. The first step in the detoxification process is the binding of mesna to 4-hydroxy\u00ad ifosfamide forming a non-urotoxic 4-sulfoethylthioifosfamide. Mesna also binds to the double bonds of acrolein and to other urotoxic metabolites and inhibits their effects on the bladder. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Mean apparent volume of distribution (V d ) for mesna is 0.652 \u00b1 0.242 L/kg after intravenous administration which suggests distribution to total body water (plasma, extracellular fluid, and intracellular water). Me tabolism Analogous to the physiological cysteine-cystine system, mesna is rapidly oxidized to its major metabolite, mesna disulfide (dimesna). Plasma concentrations of mesna exceed those of dimesna after intravenous administration. Excretion Following intravenous administration of a single 800 mg dose, approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and dimesna, respectively. Mean plasma elimination half-lives of mesna and dimesna are 0.36 hours and 1.17 hours, respectively. Mesna has a plasma clearance of 1.23 L/h/kg."

What is mesna injection? Mesna injection is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of inflammation and bleeding of the bladder (hemorrhagic cystitis) in people who receive ifosfamide (a medicine used to treat cancer). Mesna injection is not for use to reduce the risk of blood in the urine (hematuria) due to other medical conditions. Do not take mesna tablets or receive mesna injection by intravenous (IV) infusion if you are allergic to mesna or any of the ingredients in mesna injection. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in mesna injection. Before you take or receive mesna, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: are allergic to any medicines are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Females who are able to become pregnant: Your healthcare provider will verify if you are pregnant or not before you start treatment with mesna and ifosfamide. You should use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment with mesna and ifosfamide and for 6 months after the last dose. Tell your healthcare provider if you become pregnant during treatment with mesna and ifosfamide. Males with female partners who are able to become pregnant should use effective birth control during treatment with mesna and ifosfamide and for 3 months after the last dose. You should also read the ifosfamide Prescribing Information for important pregnancy, contraception, and infertility information. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if mesna passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of mesna or ifosfamide. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. How will I receive mesna injection? Mesna is given on the same day that you receive ifosfamide. Mesna can be given by an intravenous (IV) infusion into a vein or tablets taken by mouth. You will receive mesna in one of two ways: Mesna intravenous (IV) infusion into a vein at the time you receive ifosfamide and 4 and 8 hours after you receive ifosfamide, OR Mesna intravenous (IV) infusion into a vein at the time you receive ifosfamide and mesna tablets taken by mouth 2 and 6 hours after you receive ifosfamide. Take mesna tablets at the exact times and the exact dose your healthcare provider tells you to take it. During treatment with mesna intravenous (IV) infusion or mesna tablets, you should drink 4 to 8 cups of liquid (1 to 2 liters) each day. Tell your healthcare provider if you: vomit within 2 hours of taking mesna tablets by mouth miss a dose of mesna tablets have pink or red colored urine What are the possible side effects of mesna injection? Mesna may cause serious side effects, including: See \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about mesna injection?\u201d Mesna injection that is given by intravenous (IV) infusion contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol has been shown to cause serious side effects and death in premature newborns and low-birth weight babies. Avoid use of mesna injection in premature newborns and low birth weight infants. Mesna tablets do not contain benzyl alcohol.

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Less severe hypersensitivity reactions may also occur. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. ( 5.1 ) Dermatologic toxicity: Skin rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Skin rash, urticaria, and angioedema have also been seen. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. ( 5.2 ) Benzyl alcohol toxicity: Serious and fatal adverse reactions can occur in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including MESNEX injection. Avoid use in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. ( 5.3 ) Laboratory test alterations: False positive tests for urinary ketones and interference with enzymatic CPK activity tests have been seen. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Mesna may cause systemic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. These reactions may include fever, cardiovascular symptoms (hypotension, tachycardia), acute renal impairment, hypoxia, respiratory distress, urticaria, angioedema, laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, hematological abnormalities, increased liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and myalgia. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Monitor for signs or symptoms. Discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. 5.2 Dermatologic Toxicity Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and bullous and ulcerative skin and mucosal reactions, consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Mesna may cause skin and mucosal reactions characterized by urticaria, rash, erythema, pruritus, burning sensation, angioedema, periorbital edema, flushing and stomatitis. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. 5.3 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants who received benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Symptoms associated with \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d and other potential adverse reactions include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematological abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Premature neonates and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. MESNEX injection contains 10.4 mg/mL of the preservative benzyl alcohol. Avoid use of MESNEX injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. Mesna tablets do not contain benzyl alcohol [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 5.4 Laboratory Test Interferences False-Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with mesna when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies). False-Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity Mesna may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g., N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactivation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level. False-Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid Mesna may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman\u2019s reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds Mesna is a thiol compound, i.e., a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to mesna."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling. \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Dermatological Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Laboratory Test Interferences [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The most common adverse reactions (> 10%) when mesna is given with ifosfamide are nausea, vomiting, constipation, leukopenia, fatigue, fever, anorexia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, granulocytopenia, diarrhea, asthenia, abdominal pain, headache, alopecia, and somnolence. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ingenus Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-877-748-1970 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Mesna adverse reaction data are available from four Phase 1 studies in which single oral doses of 600-2400 mg of mesna tablets were administered to a total of 82 healthy volunteers. In two Phase 1 multiple-dose studies where healthy volunteers received mesna tablets alone or intravenous MESNEX followed by repeated doses of mesna tablets, flatulence and rhinitis were reported. Additional adverse reactions in healthy volunteers receiving mesna alone included abdominal pain/colic, epigastric pain/burning, mucosal irritation, lightheadedness, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, rigors, paresthesia, photophobia, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, extremity pain, malaise, chest pain, dysuria, pleuritic pain, dry mouth, dyspnea, and hyperhidrosis. In healthy volunteers, mesna was commonly associated with a rapid (within 24 hours) decrease in lymphocyte count, which was generally reversible within one week of administration. Because mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing chemotherapy regimens, it is difficult to distinguish the adverse reactions which may be due to mesna from those caused by the concomitantly administered cytotoxic agents. Adverse reactions reasonably associated with mesna administered orally in four controlled studies in which patients received ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing regimens are presented in Table 3 . Table 3: Adverse Reactions in \u22655% of Patients Receiving Mesna in combination with Ifosfamide-containing Regimens Mesna Regimen Intravenous-Oral-Oral Intravenous dosing of ifosfamide and MESNEX followed by oral doses of mesna according to the applicable dosage schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] .

(8.2) Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise patients to use effective contraception. Verify pregnancy status prior to initiation of mesna in combination with ifosfamide. (8.3) Pediatric use: In premature neonates and low-birth weight infants, avoid use of benzyl alcohol\u2013containing solutions. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Dose selection should be cautious. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. MESNEX injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm including embryo-fetal lethality. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. In embryo-fetal development studies, oral administration of mesna to pregnant rats (500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg/kg) and rabbits (500 and 1000 mg/kg) during the period of organogenesis revealed no adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended total daily human equivalent dose based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide is excreted in breast milk. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during lactation. There are no data on the presence of mesna in human or animal milk, the effect on the breastfed child, or the effect on milk production. MESNEX injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a lactating woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the breastfed infant is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of mesna or ifosfamide. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on contraception and effects on fertility. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of mesna in combination with ifosfamide. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mesna in combination with ifosfamide and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mesna in combination with ifosfamide and for 3 months after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use MESNEX injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol which has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death when administered intravenously to premature neonates and low birth weight infants . Avoid use of MESNEX injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesna did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. The ratio of ifosfamide to mesna should remain unchanged. 8.6 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna. 8.7 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mesna reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites, acrolein and 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide, resulting in their detoxification. The first step in the detoxification process is the binding of mesna to 4-hydroxy- ifosfamide forming a non-urotoxic 4-sulfoethylthioifosfamide. Mesna also binds to the double bonds of acrolein and to other urotoxic metabolites and inhibits their effects on the bladder. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration, peak plasma concentrations were reached within 1.5 to 4 hours and 3 to 7 hours for free mesna and total mesna (mesna plus dimesna and mixed disulfides), respectively. Oral bioavailability averaged 58% (range 45 to 71%) for free mesna and 89% (range 74 to 104%) for total mesna based on plasma AUC data from 8 healthy volunteers who received 1200 mg oral or intravenous doses. Food does not affect the urinary availability of orally administered mesna. Distribution Mean apparent volume of distribution (V d ) for mesna is 0.652 \u00b1 0.242 L/kg after intravenous administration which suggests distribution to total body water (plasma, extracellular fluid, and intracellular water). Metabolism Analogous to the physiological cysteine-cystine system, mesna is rapidly oxidized to its major metabolite, mesna disulfide (dimesna). Plasma concentrations of mesna exceed those of dimesna after oral or intravenous administration. Excretion Following intravenous administration of a single 800 mg dose, approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and dimesna, respectively. Mean plasma elimination half- lives of mesna and dimesna are 0.36 hours and 1.17 hours, respectively. Mesna has a plasma clearance of 1.23 L/h/kg."

      "Patient Information Mesna (mes' na) tablets What is the most important information I should know about mesna? Mesna can cause serious allergic reactions and skin reactions. These serious reactions can happen the first time you are treated with mesna or after several months of treatment with mesna. Stop treatment with mesna and go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you develop any of the symptoms listed below: fever swelling of your face, lips, mouth, or tongue trouble breathing or wheezing itching burning skin rash or hives skin redness or swelling skin blisters or peeling feel lightheaded or faint feel like your heart is racing nausea vomiting joint or muscle aches mouth sores See \u201c What are the possible side effects of mesna? \u201d for more information about side effects. What is mesna? Mesna is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of inflammation and bleeding of the bladder (hemorrhagic cystitis) in people who receive ifosfamide (a medicine used to treat cancer). Mesna is not for use to reduce the risk of blood in the urine (hematuria) due to other medical conditions. Do not take Mesna tablets if you are allergic to mesna or any of the ingredients in mesna tablets. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in mesna tablets. Before you take mesna, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: are allergic to any medicines are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Females who are able to become pregnant: Your healthcare provider will verify if you are pregnant or not before you start treatment with mesna and ifosfamide. You should use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment with mesna and ifosfamide and for 6 months after the last dose. Tell your healthcare provider if you become pregnant during treatment with mesna and ifosfamide. Males with female partners who are able to become pregnant should use effective birth control during treatment with mesna and ifosfamide and for 3 months after the last dose. You should also read the ifosfamide Prescribing Information for important pregnancy, contraception, and infertility information. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if mesna passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of mesna or ifosfamide. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. How will I receive mesna? Mesna is given on the same day that you receive ifosfamide. Mesna can be given by an intravenous (IV) infusion into a vein or tablets taken by mouth. You will receive Mesna in one of two ways: Mesna intravenous (IV) infusion into a vein at the time you receive ifosfamide and 4 and 8 hours after you receive ifosfamide, OR Mesna intravenous (IV) infusion into a vein at the time you receive ifosfamide and mesna tablets taken by mouth 2 and 6 hours after you receive ifosfamide. Take mesna tablets at the exact times and the exact dose your healthcare provider tells you to take it. During treatment with mesna tablets, you should drink 4 to 8 cups of liquid (1 to 2 liters) each day. Tell your healthcare provider if you: vomit within 2 hours of taking mesna tablets by mouth miss a dose of mesna tablets have pink or red colored urine What are the possible side effects of mesna? Mesna may cause serious side effects, including: See \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about mesna?\u201d Mesna that is given by intravenous (IV) infusion contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol has been shown to cause serious side effects and death in premature newborns and low-birth weight babies. Avoid use of MESNEX injection in premature newborns and low birth weight infants. Mesna tablets do not contain benzyl alcohol. The most common side effects of mesna when given with ifosfamide include: nausea vomiting constipation decreased white blood cell count tiredness fever decreased appetite decreased platelet count decreased red blood cell count diarrhea weakness stomach (abdomen) pain headache hair loss sleepiness These are not all the possible side effects of mesna.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Mesna injection may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of three bolus intravenous injections or a single bolus injection followed by two oral administrations of mesna tablets as outlined below. The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is adjusted, the ratio of mesna to ifosfamide should be maintained. (2) Intravenous Dosing Schedule: 0 Hours 4 Hours 8 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 - - Mesna Injection 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 Intravenous and Oral Dosing Schedule: 0 Hours 2 Hours 6 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 - - Mesna Injection 240 mg/m 2 - - Mesna Tablets - 480 mg/m 2 480 mg/m 2 Maintain sufficient urinary output, as required for ifosfamide treatment, and monitor urine for the presence of hematuria. (2.3) 2.1 Intravenous Dosing Mesna injection may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of three bolus intravenous injections as outlined below. Mesna injection is given as intravenous bolus injections in a dosage equal to 20% of the ifosfamide dosage weight by weight (w/w) at the time of ifosfamide administration and 4 and 8 hours after each dose of ifosfamide. The total daily dose of mesna injection is 60% of the ifosfamide dose. The recommended dosing schedule is outlined below in Table 1 . T able 1. Recommended Intravenous Dosing Schedule 0 Hours 4 Hours 8 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 - - Mesna Injection 1 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 1 The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is increased or decreased, the ratio of mesna to ifosfamide should be maintained. 2.2 Intravenous and Oral Dosing Mesna injection may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of a single bolus injection followed by two oral administrations of mesna tablets as outlined below. Mesna injection is given as intravenous bolus injections in a dosage equal to 20% of the ifosfamide dosage (w/w) at the time of ifosfamide administration. Mesna tablets are given orally in a dosage equal to 40% of the ifosfamide dose 2 and 6 hours after each dose of ifosfamide. The total daily dose of mesna is 100% of the ifosfamide dose. The recommended dosing schedule is outlined in Table 2 . Table 2. Recommended Intravenous and Oral Dosing Schedule 0 Hours 2 Hours 6 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 - - Mesna Injection 1 240 mg/m 2 - - Mesna Tablets - 480 mg/m 2 480 mg/m 2 1 The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is increased or decreased, the ratio of mesna to ifosfamide should be maintained. The efficacy and safety of this ratio of intravenous and oral mesna has not been established as being effective for daily doses of ifosfamide higher than 2 g/m 2 . Patients who vomit within two hours of taking oral mesna should repeat the dose or receive intravenous mesna injection. 2.3 Monitoring for Hematuria Maintain adequate hydration and sufficient urinary output, as required for ifosfamide treatment, and monitor urine for the presence of hematuria. If severe hematuria develops when mesna injection is given according to the recommended dosage schedule, dosage reductions or discontinuation of ifosfamide therapy may be required. 2.4 Preparation for Intravenous Administration and Stability Preparation Determine the volume of mesna injection for the intended dose. Dilute the volume of mesna injection for the dose in any of the following fluids to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/mL: \u2022 5% Dextrose Injection, USP \u2022 5% Dextrose and 0.2% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 5% Dextrose and 0.33% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP Stability The mesna injection multidose vials may be stored and used for up to 8 days after initial puncture. Store diluted solutions at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). Use diluted solutions within 24 hours. Do not mix mesna injection with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, and nitrogen mustard. The benzyl alcohol contained in mesna injection vials can reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Ifosfamide and mesna injection may be mixed in the same bag provided the final concentration of ifosfamide does not exceed 50 mg/mL. Higher concentrations of ifosfamide may not be compatible with mesna injection and may reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Any solutions which are discolored, hazy, or contain visible particulate matter should not be used."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Less severe hypersensitivity reactions may also occur. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna injection and provide supportive care. (5.1) \u2022 Dermatologic toxicity: Skin rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Skin rash, urticaria, and angioedema have also been seen. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna injection and provide supportive care. (5.2) \u2022 Benzyl alcohol toxicity: Serious and fatal adverse reactions can occur in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including mesna injection. Avoid use in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. (5.3) \u2022 Laboratory test alterations: False positive tests for urinary ketones and interference with enzymatic CPK activity tests have been seen. (5.4) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Mesna may cause systemic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. These reactions may include fever, cardiovascular symptoms (hypotension, tachycardia), acute renal impairment, hypoxia, respiratory distress, urticaria, angioedema, laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, hematological abnormalities, increased liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and myalgia. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Monitor for signs or symptoms. Discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. 5.2 Dermatologic Toxicity Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and bullous and ulcerative skin and mucosal reactions, consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Mesna may cause skin and mucosal reactions characterized by urticaria, rash, erythema, pruritus, burning sensation, angioedema, periorbital edema, flushing and stomatitis. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. 5.3 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants who received benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Symptoms associated with \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d and other potential adverse reactions include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematological abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Premature neonates and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Mesna injection contains 10.4 mg/mL of the preservative benzyl alcohol. Avoid use of mesna injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 5.4 Laboratory Test Interferences False-Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with mesna injection when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies). False-Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity Mesna may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g., N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactivation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level. False-Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid Mesna may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman\u2019s reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds Mesna is a thiol compound, i.e., a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to mesna."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling. \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \u2022 Dermatological Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \u2022 Laboratory Test Interferences [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] \u2022 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] The most common adverse reactions (> 10%) when mesna injection is given with ifosfamide are nausea, vomiting, constipation, leukopenia, fatigue, fever, anorexia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, granulocytopenia, diarrhea, asthenia, abdominal pain, headache, alopecia, and somnolence. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gland Pharma at 864-879-9994 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Mesna injection adverse reaction data are available from four Phase 1 studies in which single intravenous doses of 600 to 1200 mg mesna injection without concurrent chemotherapy were administered to a total of 53 healthy volunteers and single oral doses of 600 to 2400 mg of mesna tablets were administered to a total of 82 healthy volunteers. The most frequently reported side effects (observed in two or more healthy volunteers) for healthy volunteers receiving single doses of mesna injection alone were headache, injection site reactions, flushing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, diarrhea, anorexia, fever, pharyngitis, hyperesthesia, influenza-like symptoms, and coughing. In two Phase 1 multiple-dose studies where healthy volunteers received mesna tablets alone or intravenous mesna followed by repeated doses of mesna tablets, flatulence and rhinitis were reported. In addition, constipation was reported by healthy volunteers who had received repeated doses of intravenous mesna injection. Additional adverse reactions in healthy volunteers receiving mesna injection alone included injection site reactions, abdominal pain/colic, epigastric pain/burning, mucosal irritation, lightheadedness, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, rigors, paresthesia, photophobia, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, extremity pain, malaise, chest pain, dysuria, pleuritic pain, dry mouth, dyspnea, and hyperhidrosis. In healthy volunteers, mesna was commonly associated with a rapid (within 24 hours) decrease in lymphocyte count, which was generally reversible within one week of administration. Because mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing chemotherapy regimens, it is difficult to distinguish the adverse reactions which may be due to mesna from those caused by the concomitantly administered cytotoxic agents. Adverse reactions reasonably associated with mesna administered intravenously and orally in four controlled studies in which patients received ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing regimens are presented in Table 3 .

(8.1) \u2022 Lactation: Do not breastfeed. (8.2) \u2022 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise patients to use effective contraception. Verify pregnancy status prior to initiation of mesna injection in combination with ifosfamide. (8.3) \u2022 Pediatric use: In premature neonates and low-birth weight infants, avoid use of benzyl alcohol\u2013containing solutions. (8.4) \u2022 Geriatric use: Dose selection should be cautious. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mesna injection is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Mesna injection is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm including embryo-fetal lethality. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. In embryo-fetal development studies, oral administration of mesna to pregnant rats (500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg/kg) and rabbits (500 and 1000 mg/kg) during the period of organogenesis revealed no adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended total daily human equivalent dose based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesna injection is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide is excreted in breast milk. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during lactation. There are no data on the presence of mesna in human or animal milk, the effect on the breastfed child, or the effect on milk production. Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a lactating woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the breastfed infant is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of mesna or ifosfamide. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Mesna injection is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on contraception and effects on fertility. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of mesna injection in combination with ifosfamide. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mesna injection in combination with ifosfamide and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mesna injection in combination with ifosfamide and for 3 months after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol which has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death when administered intravenously to premature neonates and low birth weight infants. Avoid use of mesna injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesna injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. The ratio of ifosfamide to mesna should remain unchanged. 8.6 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna injection. 8.7 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Mesna injection is a detoxifying agent to inhibit the hemorrhagic cystitis induced by ifosfamide. The active ingredient, mesna, is a synthetic sulfhydryl compound designated as sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulfonate with a molecular formula of C 2 H 5 NaO 3 S 2 and a molecular weight of 164.18. Its structural formula is as follows: HS\u2014CH 2 \u2014CH 2 SO 3 \u2014Na + Mesna Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, aqueous solution of clear and colorless appearance in clear glass multi-dose vials for intravenous administration. Mesna Injection contains 100 mg/mL mesna, 0.25 mg/mL edetate disodium and sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. Mesna Injection multi-dose vials also contain 10.4 mg/mL of benzyl alcohol as a preservative. The solution has a pH range of between 7.5 and 8.5."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mesna reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites, acrolein and 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide, resulting in their detoxification. The first step in the detoxification process is the binding of mesna to 4-hydroxy\u00ad ifosfamide forming a non-urotoxic 4-sulfoethylthioifosfamide. Mesna also binds to the double bonds of acrolein and to other urotoxic metabolites and inhibits their effects on the bladder. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration, peak plasma concentrations were reached within 1.5 to 4 hours and 3 to 7 hours for free mesna and total mesna (mesna plus dimesna and mixed disulfides), respectively. Oral bioavailability averaged 58% (range 45 to 71%) for free mesna and 89% (range 74 to 104%) for total mesna based on plasma AUC data from 8 healthy volunteers who received 1200 mg oral or intravenous doses. Food does not affect the urinary availability of orally administered mesna. Distribution Mean apparent volume of distribution (V d ) for mesna is 0.652 \u00b1 0.242 L/kg after intravenous administration which suggests distribution to total body water (plasma, extracellular fluid, and intracellular water). Metabolism Analogous to the physiological cysteine-cystine system, mesna is rapidly oxidized to its major metabolite, mesna disulfide (dimesna). Plasma concentrations of mesna exceed those of dimesna after oral or intravenous administration. Excretion Following intravenous administration of a single 800 mg dose, approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and dimesna, respectively. Mean plasma elimination half-lives of mesna and dimesna are 0.36 hours and 1.17 hours, respectively. Mesna has a plasma clearance of 1.23 L/h/kg."

Oral bioavailability averaged 58% (range 45 to 71%) for free mesna and 89% (range 74 to 104%) for total mesna based on plasma AUC data from 8 healthy volunteers who received 1200 mg oral or intravenous doses. Food does not affect the urinary availability of orally administered mesna. Distribution Mean apparent volume of distribution (V d ) for mesna is 0.652 \u00b1 0.242 L/kg after intravenous administration which suggests distribution to total body water (plasma, extracellular fluid, and intracellular water). Metabolism Analogous to the physiological cysteine-cystine system, mesna is rapidly oxidized to its major metabolite, mesna disulfide (dimesna). Plasma concentrations of mesna exceed those of dimesna after oral or intravenous administration. Excretion Following intravenous administration of a single 800 mg dose, approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and dimesna, respectively. Mean plasma elimination half-lives of mesna and dimesna are 0.36 hours and 1.17 hours, respectively. Mesna has a plasma clearance of 1.23 L/h/kg."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Intravenous Mesna Injection Hemorrhagic cystitis produced by ifosfamide is dose dependent (Table 4) . At a dose of 1.2 g/m 2 ifosfamide administered daily for 5 days, 16 to 26% of the patients who received conventional uroprophylaxis (high fluid intake, alkalinization of the urine, and the administration of diuretics) developed hematuria (>50 RBC per hpf or macrohematuria) (Studies 1, 2, and 3). In contrast, none of the patients who received mesna injection together with this dose of ifosfamide developed hematuria (Studies 3 and 4). In two randomized studies, (Studies 5 and 6), higher doses of ifosfamide, from 2 g/m 2 to 4 g/m 2 administered for 3 to 5 days, produced hematuria in 31 to 100% of the patients. When mesna injection was administered together with these doses of ifosfamide, the incidence of hematuria was less than 7%.

Study 8 was a randomized, multicenter study in cancer patients receiving ifosfamide at 2.0 g/m2 for 5 days. In both studies, development of grade 3 or 4 hematuria was the primary efficacy endpoint.

Dilute the volume of mesna injection for the dose in any of the following fluids to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/mL: \u2022 5% Dextrose Injection, USP \u2022 5% Dextrose and 0.2% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 5% Dextrose and 0.33% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP Stability The mesna injection multidose vials may be stored and used for up to 8 days after initial puncture. Store diluted solutions at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). Use diluted solutions within 24 hours. Do not mix mesna injection with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, and nitrogen mustard. The benzyl alcohol contained in mesna injection vials can reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Ifosfamide and mesna may be mixed in the same bag provided the final concentration of ifosfamide does not exceed 50 mg/mL. Higher concentrations of ifosfamide may not be compatible with mesna and may reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Any solutions which are discolored, hazy, or contain visible particulate matter should not be used."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Less severe hypersensitivity reactions may also occur. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. (5.1) \u2022 Dermatologic toxicity: Skin rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Skin rash, urticaria, and angioedema have also been seen. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. (5.2) \u2022 Benzyl alcohol toxicity: Serious and fatal adverse reactions can occur in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including mesna injection. Avoid use in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. (5.3) \u2022 Laboratory test alterations: False positive tests for urinary ketones and interference with enzymatic CPK activity tests have been seen. (5.4) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Mesna may cause systemic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. These reactions may include fever, cardiovascular symptoms (hypotension, tachycardia), acute renal impairment, hypoxia, respiratory distress, urticaria, angioedema, laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, hematological abnormalities, increased liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and myalgia. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Monitor for signs or symptoms. Discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. 5.2 Dermatologic Toxicity Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and bullous and ulcerative skin and mucosal reactions, consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. mesna may cause skin and mucosal reactions characterized by urticaria, rash, erythema, pruritus, burning sensation, angioedema, periorbital edema, flushing and stomatitis. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. 5.3 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants who received benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Symptoms associated with \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d and other potential adverse reactions include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematological abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Premature neonates and low-birth weight may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Mesna injection contains 10.4 mg/mL of the preservative benzyl alcohol. Avoid use of mesna in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. MESNEX tablets do not contain benzyl alcohol [ See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.4 Laboratory Test Interferences False-Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with mesna when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies). False-Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity Mesna may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g., N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactivation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level. False-Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid Mesna may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman\u2019s reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds Mesna is a thiol compound, i.e., a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to mesna."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling. \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Dermatological Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Laboratory Test Interferences [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The most common adverse reactions (> 10%) when mesna is given with ifosfamide are nausea, vomiting, constipation, leukopenia, fatigue, fever, anorexia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, granulocytopenia, diarrhea, asthenia, abdominal pain, headache, alopecia, and somnolence. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Baxter Healthcare at 1-866-888-2472, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Mesna adverse reaction data are available from four Phase 1 studies in which single intravenous doses of 600-1200 mg mesna injection without concurrent chemotherapy were administered to a total of 53 healthy volunteers and single oral doses of 600-2400 mg of MESNEX tablets were administered to a total of 82 healthy volunteers. The most frequently reported side effects (observed in two or more healthy volunteers) for healthy volunteers receiving single doses of mesna injection alone were headache, injection site reactions, flushing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, diarrhea, anorexia, fever, pharyngitis, hyperesthesia, influenza-like symptoms, and coughing. In two Phase 1 multiple-dose studies where healthy volunteers received MESNEX tablets alone or intravenous mesna followed by repeated doses of MESNEX tablets, flatulence and rhinitis were reported. In addition, constipation was reported by healthy volunteers who had received repeated doses of intravenous mesna. Additional adverse reactions in healthy volunteers receiving mesna alone included injection site reactions, abdominal pain/colic, epigastric pain/burning, mucosal irritation, lightheadedness, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, rigors, paresthesia, photophobia, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, extremity pain, malaise, chest pain, dysuria, pleuritic pain, dry mouth, dyspnea, and hyperhidrosis. In healthy volunteers, mesna was commonly associated with a rapid (within 24 hours) decrease in lymphocyte count, which was generally reversible within one week of administration. Because mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing chemotherapy regimens, it is difficult to distinguish the adverse reactions which may be due to MESNEX from those caused by the concomitantly administered cytotoxic agents. Adverse reactions reasonably associated with mesna administered intravenously and orally in four controlled studies in which patients received ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing regimens are presented in .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Mesna in combination with ifosfamide can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus. (8.1) \u2022 Lactation: Do not breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) \u2022 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise patients to use effective contraception. Verify pregnancy status prior to initiation of mesna in combination with ifosfamide. (8.3) \u2022 Pediatric use: In premature neonates and low-birth weight infants, avoid use on benzyl alcohol-containing solutions. ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric use: Dose selection should be cautious. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm including embryo-fetal lethality. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. In embryo-fetal development studies, oral administration of mesna to pregnant rats (500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg/kg) and rabbits (500 and 1000 mg/kg) during the period of organogenesis revealed no adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended total daily human equivalent dose based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide is excreted in breast milk. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during lactation. There are no data on the presence of mesna in human or animal milk, the effect on the breastfed child, or the effect on milk production. Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a lactating woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the breastfed infant is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of mesna or Ifosfamide. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on contraception and effects on fertility. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of mesna in combination with ifosfamide. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mesna in combination with ifosfamide and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mesna in combination with ifosfamide and for 3 months after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol which has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death when administered intravenously to premature neonates and low birth weight infants . Avoid use of mesna injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesna did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. The ratio of ifosfamide to mesna should remain unchanged. 8.6 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna. 8.7 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Mesna is a detoxifying agent to inhibit the hemorrhagic cystitis induced by ifosfamide. The active ingredient, mesna, is a synthetic sulfhydryl compound designated as sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulfonate with a molecular formula of C 2 H 5 NaO 3 S 2 and a molecular weight of 164.18. Its structural formula is as follows: HS\u2013CH 2 \u2013CH 2 SO 3 \u2013Na + Mesna injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, aqueous solution of clear and colorless appearance in clear glass multidose vials for intravenous administration. Mesna injection contains 100 mg/mL mesna, 0.25 mg/mL edetate disodium and sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. Mesna injection multidose vials also contain 10.4 mg/mL of benzyl alcohol as a preservative. The solution has a pH range of 7.5-8.5. MESNEX (mesna) tablets are white, oblong, scored biconvex film-coated tablets with the imprint M4. They contain 400 mg mesna. The excipients are calcium phosphate, cornstarch, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, lactose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, povidone, simethicone, and titanium dioxide."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mesna reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites, acrolein and 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide, resulting in their detoxification. The first step in the detoxification process is the binding of mesna to 4\u2011hydroxy-ifosfamide forming a non-urotoxic 4-sulfoethylthioifosfamide. Mesna also binds to the double bonds of acrolein and to other urotoxic metabolites and inhibits their effects on the bladder. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration, peak plasma concentrations were reached within 1.5 to 4 hours and 3 to 7 hours for free mesna and total mesna (mesna plus dimesna and mixed disulfides), respectively. Oral bioavailability averaged 58% (range 45 to 71%) for free mesna and 89% (range 74 to 104%) for total mesna based on plasma AUC data from 8 healthy volunteers who received 1200 mg oral or intravenous doses. Food does not affect the urinary availability of orally administered mesna. Distribution Mean apparent volume of distribution (V d ) for mesna is 0.652 \u00b1 0.242 L/kg after intravenous administration which suggests distribution to total body water (plasma, extracellular fluid, and intracellular water). Metabolism Analogous to the physiological cysteine-cystine system, mesna is rapidly oxidized to its major metabolite, mesna disulfide (dimesna). Plasma concentrations of mesna exceed those of dimesna after oral or intravenous administration. Excretion Following intravenous administration of a single 800 mg dose, approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and dimesna, respectively. Mean plasma elimination half-lives of mesna and dimesna are 0.36 hours and 1.17 hours, respectively. Mesna has a plasma clearance of 1.23 L/h/kg."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Intravenous mesna Hemorrhagic cystitis produced by ifosfamide is dose dependent (). At a dose of 1.2 g/m 2 ifosfamide administered daily for 5 days, 16 to 26% of the patients who received conventional uroprophylaxis (high fluid intake, alkalinization of the urine, and the administration of diuretics) developed hematuria (>50 RBC per hpf or macrohematuria) (Studies 1, 2, and 3). In contrast, none of the patients who received mesna injection together with this dose of ifosfamide developed hematuria (Studies 3 and 4). In two randomized studies, (Studies 5 and 6), higher doses of ifosfamide, from 2 g/m 2 to 4 g/m 2 administered for 3 to 5 days, produced hematuria in 31 to 100% of the patients. When mesna was administered together with these doses of ifosfamide, the incidence of hematuria was less than 7%. Table 4.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Mesna Injection may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of three bolus intravenous injections or a single bolus injection followed by two oral administrations of mesna tablets as outlined below. The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is adjusted, the ratio of mesna to ifosfamide should be maintained. ( 2 ) Intravenous Dosing Schedule: 0 Hours 4 Hours 8 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 -\u00ad -\u00ad Mesna injection 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 Intravenous and Oral Dosing Schedule: 0 Hours 2 Hours 6 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 -\u00ad -\u00ad Mesna injection 240 mg/m 2 -\u00ad -\u00ad Mesna tablets -\u00ad 480 mg/m 2 480 mg/m 2 Maintain sufficient urinary output, as required for ifosfamide treatment, and monitor urine for the presence of hematuria. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Intravenous Dosing Mesna Injection may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of three bolus intravenous injections as outlined below. Mesna Injection is given as intravenous bolus injections in a dosage equal to 20% of the ifosfamide dosage weight by weight (w/w) at the time of ifosfamide administration and 4 and 8 hours after each dose of ifosfamide. The total daily dose of Mesna Injection is 60% of the ifosfamide dose. The recommended dosing schedule is outlined below in Table 1 . Table 1. Recommended Intravenous Dosing Schedule 0 Hours 4 Hours 8 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 - - Mesna injection 1 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 1 The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is increased or decreased, the ratio of Mesna Injection to ifosfamide should be maintained. 2.2 Intravenous and Oral Dosing Mesna Injection may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of a single bolus injection followed by two oral administrations of mesna tablets as outlined below. Mesna Injection is given as intravenous bolus injections in a dosage equal to 20% of the ifosfamide dosage (w/w) at the time of ifosfamide administration. Mesna tablets are given orally in a dosage equal to 40% of the ifosfamide dose 2 and 6 hours after each dose of ifosfamide. The total daily dose of mesna is 100% of the ifosfamide dose. The recommended dosing schedule is outlined in Table 2 . Table 2. Recommended Intravenous and Oral Dosing Schedule 0 Hours 2 Hours 6 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 - - Mesna injection 1 240 mg/m 2 - - Mesna tablets - 480 mg/m 2 480 mg/m 2 1 The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is increased or decreased, the ratio of mesna to ifosfamide should be maintained. The efficacy and safety of this ratio of intravenous and oral mesna has not been established as being effective for daily doses of ifosfamide higher than 2 g/m 2 . Patients who vomit within two hours of taking oral mesna should repeat the dose or receive intravenous Mesna Injection. 2.3 Monitoring for Hematuria Maintain adequate hydration and sufficient urinary output, as required for ifosfamide treatment, and monitor urine for the presence of hematuria. If severe hematuria develops when Mesna Injection is given according to the recommended dosage schedule, dosage reductions or discontinuation of ifosfamide therapy may be required. 2.4 Preparation for Intravenous Administration and Stability Preparation Determine the volume of Mesna Injection for the intended dose. Dilute the volume of Mesna Injection for the dose in any of the following fluids to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/mL: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP 5% Dextrose and 0.2% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 5% Dextrose and 0.33% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP Stability The Mesna Injection multiple dose vials may be stored and used for up to 8 days after initial puncture. Store diluted solutions at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). Use diluted solutions within 24 hours. Do not mix Mesna Injection with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, and nitrogen mustard. The benzyl alcohol contained in Mesna Injection vials can reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Ifosfamide and Mesna Injection may be mixed in the same bag provided the final concentration of ifosfamide does not exceed 50 mg/mL. Higher concentrations of ifosfamide may not be compatible with Mesna Injection and may reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Any solutions which are discolored, hazy, or contain visible particulate matter should not be used."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Less severe hypersensitivity reactions may also occur. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. ( 5.1 ) Dermatologic toxicity: Skin rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Skin rash, urticaria, and angioedema have also been seen. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. ( 5.2 ) Benzyl alcohol toxicity: Serious and fatal adverse reactions can occur in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Mesna Injection. Avoid use in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. ( 5.3 ) Laboratory test alterations: False positive tests for urinary ketones and interference with enzymatic CPK activity tests have been seen. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Mesna may cause systemic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. These reactions may include fever, cardiovascular symptoms (hypotension, tachycardia), acute renal impairment, hypoxia, respiratory distress, urticaria, angioedema, laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, hematological abnormalities, increased liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and myalgia. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Monitor for signs or symptoms. Discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. 5.2 Dermatologic Toxicity Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and bullous and ulcerative skin and mucosal reactions, consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Mesna may cause skin and mucosal reactions characterized by urticaria, rash, erythema, pruritus, burning sensation, angioedema, periorbital edema, flushing and stomatitis. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. 5.3 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants who received benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Symptoms associated with \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d and other potential adverse reactions include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematological abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Premature neonates and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Mesna injection contains 10.4 mg/mL of the preservative benzyl alcohol. Avoid use of Mesna Injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . 5.4 Laboratory Test Interferences False-Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with mesna when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies). False-Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity Mesna may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g., N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactivation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level. False-Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid Mesna may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman\u2019s reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds Mesna is a thiol compound, i.e., a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to Mesna Injection."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling. \u00b7 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \u00b7 Dermatological Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \u00b7 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \u00b7 Laboratory Test Interferences [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] \u00b7 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] The most common adverse reactions (> 10%) when mesna is given with ifosfamide are nausea, vomiting, constipation, leukopenia, fatigue, fever, anorexia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, granulocytopenia, diarrhea, asthenia, abdominal pain, headache, alopecia, and somnolence. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Mesna adverse reaction data are available from four Phase 1 studies in which single intravenous doses of 600 to 1,200 mg mesna injection without concurrent chemotherapy were administered to a total of 53 healthy volunteers and single oral doses of 600 to 2,400 mg of mesna tablets were administered to a total of 82 healthy volunteers. The most frequently reported side effects (observed in two or more healthy volunteers) for healthy volunteers receiving single doses of mesna injection alone were headache, injection site reactions, flushing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, diarrhea, anorexia, fever, pharyngitis, hyperesthesia, influenza-like symptoms, and coughing. In two Phase 1 multiple-dose studies where healthy volunteers received mesna tablets alone or intravenous mesna injection followed by repeated doses of mesna tablets, flatulence and rhinitis were reported. In addition, constipation was reported by healthy volunteers who had received repeated doses of intravenous mesna injection. Additional adverse reactions in healthy volunteers receiving mesna alone included injection site reactions, abdominal pain/colic, epigastric pain/burning, mucosal irritation, lightheadedness, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, rigors, paresthesia, photophobia, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, extremity pain, malaise, chest pain, dysuria, pleuritic pain, dry mouth, dyspnea, and hyperhidrosis. In healthy volunteers, mesna was commonly associated with a rapid (within 24 hours) decrease in lymphocyte count, which was generally reversible within one week of administration. Because mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing chemotherapy regimens, it is difficult to distinguish the adverse reactions which may be due to mesna from those caused by the concomitantly administered cytotoxic agents. Adverse reactions reasonably associated with mesna administered intravenously and orally in four controlled studies in which patients received ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing regimens are presented in Table 3 .

Because these reactions are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Mesna Injection in combination with ifosfamide can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Do not breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise patients to use effective contraception. Verify pregnancy status prior to initiation of Mesna Injection in combination with ifosfamide. ( 8.3 ) Pediatric use: In premature neonates and low-birth weight infants, avoid use of benzyl alcohol-containing solutions. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Dose selection should be cautious. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mesna Injection is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. Mesna Injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Mesna Injection is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm including embryo-fetal lethality. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. In embryo-fetal development studies, oral administration of mesna to pregnant rats (500, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 mg/kg) and rabbits (500 and 1,000 mg/kg) during the period of organogenesis revealed no adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended total daily human equivalent dose based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesna Injection is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide is excreted in breast milk. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during lactation. There are no data on the presence of mesna in human or animal milk, the effect on the breastfed child, or the effect on milk production. Mesna Injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a lactating woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the breastfed infant is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of mesna or ifosfamide. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Mesna Injection is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on contraception and effects on fertility. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of Mesna Injection in combination with ifosfamide. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Mesna Injection in combination with ifosfamide and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Mesna Injection in combination with ifosfamide and for 3 months after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use Mesna Injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol which has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death when administered intravenously to premature neonates and low birth weight infants. Avoid use of Mesna Injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesna did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. The ratio of ifosfamide to mesna should remain unchanged. 8.6 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna. 8.7 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Mesna Injection is a detoxifying agent to inhibit the hemorrhagic cystitis induced by ifosfamide. The active ingredient, mesna, is a synthetic sulfhydryl compound designated as sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulfonate with a molecular formula of C 2 H 5 NaO 3 S 2 and a molecular weight of 164.18. Its structural formula is as follows: HS\u2013CH 2 \u2013CH 2 SO 3 \u2013Na + Mesna Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, aqueous solution of clear and colorless appearance in clear glass multiple dose vials for intravenous administration. Mesna Injection contains 100 mg/mL mesna, 0.25 mg/mL edetate disodium and sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. Mesna Injection multiple dose vials also contain 10.4 mg/mL of benzyl alcohol as a preservative. The solution has a pH range of 6.5 to 8.5."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mesna reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites, acrolein and 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide, resulting in their detoxification. The first step in the detoxification process is the binding of mesna to 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide forming a non-urotoxic 4-sulfoethylthioifosfamide. Mesna also binds to the double bonds of acrolein and to other urotoxic metabolites and inhibits their effects on the bladder. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration, peak plasma concentrations were reached within 1.5 to 4 hours and 3 to 7 hours for free mesna and total mesna (mesna plus dimesna and mixed disulfides), respectively. Oral bioavailability averaged 58% (range 45 to 71%) for free mesna and 89% (range 74 to 104%) for total mesna based on plasma AUC data from 8 healthy volunteers who received 1,200 mg oral or intravenous doses. Food does not affect the urinary availability of orally administered mesna. Distribution Mean apparent volume of distribution (V d ) for mesna is 0.652 \u00b1 0.242 L/kg after intravenous administration which suggests distribution to total body water (plasma, extracellular fluid, and intracellular water). Metabolism Analogous to the physiological cysteine-cystine system, mesna is rapidly oxidized to its major metabolite, mesna disulfide (dimesna). Plasma concentrations of mesna exceed those of dimesna after oral or intravenous administration. Excretion Following intravenous administration of a single 800 mg dose, approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and dimesna, respectively. Mean plasma elimination half-lives of mesna and dimesna are 0.36 hours and 1.17 hours, respectively. Mesna has a plasma clearance of 1.23 L/h/kg."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Intravenous Mesna Injection Hemorrhagic cystitis produced by ifosfamide is dose dependent ( Table 4 ). At a dose of 1.2 g/m 2 ifosfamide administered daily for 5 days, 16 to 26% of the patients who received conventional uroprophylaxis (high fluid intake, alkalinization of the urine, and the administration of diuretics) developed hematuria (>50 RBC per hpf or macrohematuria) (Studies 1, 2, and 3). In contrast, none of the patients who received mesna injection together with this dose of ifosfamide developed hematuria (Studies 3 and 4). In two randomized studies, (Studies 5 and 6), higher doses of ifosfamide, from 2 g/m 2 to 4 g/m 2 administered for 3 to 5 days, produced hematuria in 31 to 100% of the patients. When mesna injection was administered together with these doses of ifosfamide, the incidence of hematuria was less than 7%. Table 4.

Study 7 was an open label, randomized, two-way crossover study comparing three intravenous doses with an initial intravenous dose followed by two oral doses of mesna in patients with cancer treated with ifosfamide at a dose of 1.2 g/m 2 to 2.0 g/m 2 for 3 to 5 days. Study 8 was a randomized, multicenter study in cancer patients receiving ifosfamide at 2.0 g/m 2 for 5 days. In both studies, development of grade 3 or 4 hematuria was the primary efficacy endpoint.

When the dosage of ifosfamide is increased or decreased, the ratio of mesna to ifosfamide should be maintained. 240 mg/m 2 \u2013 \u2013 MESNEX tablets \u2013 480 mg/m 2 480 mg/m 2 The efficacy and safety of this ratio of intravenous mesna and oral MESNEX has not been established as being effective for daily doses of ifosfamide higher than 2 g/m 2 . Patients who vomit within two hours of taking oral MESNEX should repeat the dose or receive intravenous mesna. 2.3 Monitoring of Hematuria Maintain adequate hydration and sufficient urinary output, as required for ifosfamide treatment, and monitor urine for the presence of hematuria. If severe hematuria develops when mesna is given according to the recommended dosage schedule, dosage reductions or discontinuation of ifosfamide therapy may be required. 2.4 Preparation for Intravenous Administration and Stability Preparation Determine the volume of mesna injection for the intended dose. Dilute the volume of mesna injection for the dose in any of the following fluids to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/mL: \u2022 5% Dextrose Injection, USP \u2022 5% Dextrose and 0.2% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 5% Dextrose and 0.33% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP \u2022 Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP Stability The mesna injection multidose vials may be stored and used for up to 8 days after initial puncture. Store diluted solutions at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). Use diluted solutions within 24 hours. Do not mix mesna injection with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, and nitrogen mustard. The benzyl alcohol contained in mesna injection vials can reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Ifosfamide and mesna may be mixed in the same bag provided the final concentration of ifosfamide does not exceed 50 mg/mL. Higher concentrations of ifosfamide may not be compatible with mesna and may reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Any solutions which are discolored, hazy, or contain visible particulate matter should not be used."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Less severe hypersensitivity reactions may also occur. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Dermatologic toxicity: Skin rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Skin rash, urticaria, and angioedema have also been seen. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Benzyl alcohol toxicity: Serious and fatal adverse reactions can occur in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including mesna injection. Avoid use in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Laboratory test alterations: False positive tests for urinary ketones and interference with enzymatic CPK activity tests have been seen. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Mesna may cause systemic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. These reactions may include fever, cardiovascular symptoms (hypotension, tachycardia), acute renal impairment, hypoxia, respiratory distress, urticaria, angioedema, laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, hematological abnormalities, increased liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and myalgia. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Monitor for signs or symptoms. Discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. 5.2 Dermatologic Toxicity Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and bullous and ulcerative skin and mucosal reactions, consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Mesna may cause skin and mucosal reactions characterized by urticaria, rash, erythema, pruritus, burning sensation, angioedema, periorbital edema, flushing and stomatitis. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Discontinue mesna and provide supportive care. 5.3 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants who received benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Symptoms associated with \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d and other potential adverse reactions include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematological abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Premature neonates and low-birth weight may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Mesna injection contains 10.4 mg/mL of the preservative benzyl alcohol. Avoid use of mesna in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. MESNEX tablets do not contain benzyl alcohol [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.4 Laboratory Test Interferences False-Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with mesna when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies). False-Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity Mesna may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g., N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactiviation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level. False-Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid Mesna may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman\u2019s reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds Mesna is a thiol compound, i.e., a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to mesna."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling. \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Dermatological Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Laboratory Test Interferences [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The most common adverse reactions (> 10%) when mesna is given with ifosfamide are nausea, vomiting, constipation, leukopenia, fatigue, fever, anorexia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, granulocytopenia, diarrhea, asthenia, abdominal pain, headache, alopecia, and somnolence. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Baxter Healthcare at 1-866-888-2472, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Mesna adverse reaction data are available from four Phase 1 studies in which single intravenous doses of 600-1200 mg mesna injection without concurrent chemotherapy were administered to a total of 53 healthy volunteers and single oral doses of 600-2400 mg of MESNEX tablets were administered to a total of 82 healthy volunteers. The most frequently reported side effects (observed in two or more healthy volunteers) for healthy volunteers receiving single doses of mesna injection alone were headache, injection site reactions, flushing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, diarrhea, anorexia, fever, pharyngitis, hyperesthesia, influenza-like symptoms, and coughing. In two Phase 1 multiple-dose studies where healthy volunteers received MESNEX tablets alone or intravenous mesna followed by repeated doses of MESNEX tablets, flatulence and rhinitis were reported. In addition, constipation was reported by healthy volunteers who had received repeated doses of intravenous mesna. Additional adverse reactions in healthy volunteers receiving mesna alone included injection site reactions, abdominal pain/colic, epigastric pain/burning, mucosal irritation, lightheadedness, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, rigors, paresthesia, photophobia, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, extremity pain, malaise, chest pain, dysuria, pleuritic pain, dry mouth, dyspnea, and hyperhidrosis. In healthy volunteers, mesna was commonly associated with a rapid (within 24 hours) decrease in lymphocyte count, which was generally reversible within one week of administration. Because mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing chemotherapy regimens, it is difficult to distinguish the adverse reactions which may be due to mesna from those caused by the concomitantly administered cytotoxic agents. Adverse reactions reasonably associated with mesna administered intravenously and orally in four controlled studies in which patients received ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing regimens are presented in Table 3.

Because these reactions are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Mesna in combination with ifosfamide can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus. ( 8.1 ) \u2022 Lactation: Do not breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) \u2022 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise patients to use effective contraception. Verify pregnancy status prior to initiation of mesna in combination with ifosfamide. ( 8.3 ) \u2022 Pediatric use: In premature neonates and low-birth weight infants, avoid use of benzyl alcohol-containing solutions. ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric use: Dose selection should be cautious. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm including embryo-fetal lethality. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy. In embryo-fetal development studies, oral administration of mesna to pregnant rats (500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg/kg) and rabbits (500 and 1000 mg/kg) during the period of organogenesis revealed no adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended total daily human equivalent dose based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mesna is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide is excreted in breast milk. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during lactation. There are no data on the presence of mesna in human or animal milk, the effect on the breastfed child, or the effect on milk production. Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a lactating woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the breastfed infant is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of mesna or ifosfamide. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential MESNEX is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents. Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on contraception and effects on fertility. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of mesna in combination with ifosfamide. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mesna in combination with ifosfamide and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mesna in combination with ifosfamide and for 3 months after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use Mesna injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol which has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death when administered intravenously to premature neonates and low birth weight infants . Avoid use of mesna injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mesna did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. The ratio of ifosfamide to mesna should remain unchanged. 8.6 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna. 8.7 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mesna."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Mesna is a detoxifying agent to inhibit the hemorrhagic cystitis induced by ifosfamide. The active ingredient, mesna, is a synthetic sulfhydryl compound designated as sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulfonate with a molecular formula of C 2 H 5 NaO 3 S 2 and a molecular weight of 164.18. Its structural formula is as follows: HS\u2013CH 2 \u2013CH 2 SO 3 \u2013Na + Mesna injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, aqueous solution of clear and colorless appearance in clear glass multidose vials for intravenous administration. Mesna injection contains 100 mg/mL mesna, 0.25 mg/mL edetate disodium and sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. Mesna injection multidose vials also contain 10.4 mg/mL of benzyl alcohol as a preservative. The solution has a pH range of 7.5-8.5. MESNEX tablets are white, oblong, scored biconvex film-coated tablets with the imprint M4. They contain 400 mg mesna. The excipients are calcium phosphate, cornstarch, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, lactose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, povidone, simethicone, and titanium dioxide."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mesna reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites, acrolein and 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide, resulting in their detoxification. The first step in the detoxification process is the binding of mesna to 4\u2011hydroxy-ifosfamide forming a non-urotoxic 4-sulfoethylthioifosfamide. Mesna also binds to the double bonds of acrolein and to other urotoxic metabolites and inhibits their effects on the bladder. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration, peak plasma concentrations were reached within 1.5 to 4 hours and 3 to 7 hours for free mesna and total mesna (mesna plus dimesna and mixed disulfides), respectively. Oral bioavailability averaged 58% (range 45 to 71%) for free mesna and 89% (range 74 to 104%) for total mesna based on plasma AUC data from 8 healthy volunteers who received 1200 mg oral or intravenous doses. Food does not affect the urinary availability of orally administered mesna. Distribution Mean apparent volume of distribution (V d ) for mesna is 0.652 \u00b1 0.242 L/kg after intravenous administration which suggests distribution to total body water (plasma, extracellular fluid, and intracellular water). Metabolism Analogous to the physiological cysteine-cystine system, mesna is rapidly oxidized to its major metabolite, mesna disulfide (dimesna). Plasma concentrations of mesna exceed those of dimesna after oral or intravenous administration. Excretion Following intravenous administration of a single 800 mg dose, approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and dimesna, respectively. Mean plasma elimination half-lives of mesna and dimesna are 0.36 hours and 1.17 hours, respectively. Mesna has a plasma clearance of 1.23 L/h/kg."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Intravenous Mesna Hemorrhagic cystitis produced by ifosfamide is dose dependent (Table 4). At a dose of 1.2 g/m 2 ifosfamide administered daily for 5 days, 16 to 26% of the patients who received conventional uroprophylaxis (high fluid intake, alkalinization of the urine, and the administration of diuretics) developed hematuria (>50 RBC per hpf or macrohematuria) (Studies 1, 2, and 3). In contrast, none of the patients who received mesna injection together with this dose of ifosfamide developed hematuria (Studies 3 and 4). In two randomized studies, (Studies 5 and 6), higher doses of ifosfamide, from 2 g/m 2 to 4 g/m 2 administered for 3 to 5 days, produced hematuria in 31 to 100% of the patients. When mesna was administered together with these doses of ifosfamide, the incidence of hematuria was less than 7%. Table 4.

Study 7 was an open label, randomized, two-way crossover study comparing three intravenous doses with an initial intravenous dose followed by two oral doses of MESNEX in patients with cancer treated with ifosfamide at a dose of 1.2 g/m 2 to 2.0 g/m 2 for 3 to 5 days. Study 8 was a randomized, multicenter study in cancer patients receiving ifosfamide at 2.0 g/m 2 for 5 days. In both studies, development of grade 3 or 4 hematuria was the primary efficacy endpoint.
