      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Granisetron is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT 3 ) receptor antagonist with little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT 1 ; 5-HT 1A ; 5-HT 1B/C ; 5-HT 2 ; for \u03b1 1- , \u03b1 2- , or \u03b2-adrenoreceptors; for dopamine-D 2 ; or for histamine-H 1 ; benzodiazepine; picrotoxin or opioid receptors. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT 3 type are located peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. During chemotherapy that induces vomiting, mucosal enterochromaffin cells release serotonin, which stimulates 5-HT 3 receptors. This evokes vagal afferent discharge, inducing vomiting. Animal studies demonstrate that, in binding to 5-HT 3 receptors, granisetron blocks serotonin stimulation and subsequent vomiting after emetogenic stimuli such as cisplatin. In the ferret animal model, a single granisetron injection prevented vomiting due to high-dose cisplatin or arrested vomiting within 5 to 30 seconds. In most human studies, granisetron has had little effect on blood pressure, heart rate or ECG. No evidence of an effect on plasma prolactin or aldosterone concentrations has been found in other studies. Following single and multiple oral doses, granisetron hydrochloride tablets slowed colonic transit in normal volunteers. However, granisetron hydrochloride had no effect on oro-cecal transit time in normal volunteers when given as a single intravenous (IV) infusion of 50 mcg/kg or 200 mcg/kg. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers and adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, administration of granisetron hydrochloride tablets produced mean pharmacokinetic data shown in Table 1 . Table 1 Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Median [range]) Following Granisetron Hydrochloride Tablets Peak Plasma Concentration (ng/mL) Terminal Phase Plasma Half-Life (h) Volume of Distribution (L/kg) Total Clearance (L/h/kg) Cancer Patients 1 mg twice a day, 7 days (n=27) 5.99 [0.63 to 30.9] N.D. 1 N.D. 0.52 [0.09 to 7.37] Volunteers single 1 mg dose (n=39) 3.63 [0.27 to 9.14] 6.23 [0.96 to 19.9] 3.94 [1.89 to 39.4] 0.41 [0.11 to 24.6] 1 Not determined after oral administration; following a single intravenous dose of 40 mcg/kg, terminal phase half-life was determined to be 8.95 hours. N.D. Not determined. Absorption When granisetron hydrochloride tablets were administered with food, AUC was decreased by 5% and C max increased by 30% in non-fasted healthy volunteers who received a single dose of 10 mg. Distribution Plasma protein binding is approximately 65% and granisetron distributes freely between plasma and red blood cells. Metabolism Granisetron metabolism involves N-demethylation and aromatic ring oxidation followed by conjugation. In vitro liver microsomal studies show that granisetron's major route of metabolism is inhibited by ketoconazole, suggestive of metabolism mediated by the cytochrome P-450 3A subfamily. Animal studies suggest that some of the metabolites may also have 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity. Elimination Clearance is predominantly by hepatic metabolism. In normal volunteers, approximately 11% of the orally administered dose is eliminated unchanged in the urine in 48 hours. The remainder of the dose is excreted as metabolites, 48% in the urine and 38% in the feces. Subpopulations Gender The effects of gender on the pharmacokinetics of granisetron hydrochloride tablets have not been studied. However, after intravenous infusion of granisetron hydrochloride, no difference in mean AUC was found between males and females, although males had a higher C max generally. In elderly and pediatric patients and in patients with renal failure or hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of granisetron was determined following administration of intravenous granisetron hydrochloride. Elderly The ranges of the pharmacokinetic parameters in elderly volunteers (mean age 71 years), given a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection, were generally similar to those in younger healthy volunteers; mean values were lower for clearance and longer for half-life in the elderly. Renal Failure Patients Total clearance of granisetron was not affected in patients with severe renal failure who received a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection. Hepatically Impaired Patients A pharmacokinetic study with intravenous granisetron hydrochloride in patients with hepatic impairment due to neoplastic liver involvement showed that total clearance was approximately halved compared to patients without hepatic impairment. Given the wide variability in pharmacokinetic parameters noted in patients, dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic functional impairment is not necessary. Pediatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study in pediatric cancer patients (2 to 16 years of age), given a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection, showed that volume of distribution and total clearance increased with age. No relationship with age was observed for peak plasma concentration or terminal phase plasma half-life. When volume of distribution and total clearance are adjusted for body weight, the pharmacokinetics of granisetron are similar in pediatric and adult cancer patients."

      "CLINICAL TRIALS Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Granisetron hydrochloride tablets prevent nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer therapy, as shown by 24 hour efficacy data from studies using both moderately- and highly-emetogenic chemotherapy. Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy The first trial compared granisetron hydrochloride tablets doses of 0.25 mg to 2 mg twice a day, in 930 cancer patients receiving, principally, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, and cisplatin (20 mg/m 2 to 50 mg/m 2 ). Efficacy was based on complete response (i.e., no vomiting, no moderate or severe nausea, no rescue medication), no vomiting, and no nausea. Table 2 summarizes the results of this study. Table 2 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting 24 Hours Post-Chemotherapy 1 Percentages of Patients Granisetron Hydrochloride Tablet Dose Efficacy Measures 0.25 mg twice a day (n=229) % 0.5 mg twice a day (n=235) % 1 mg twice a day (n=233) % 2 mg twice a day (n=233) % Complete Response 2 61 70* 81*\u2020 72* No Vomiting 66 77* 88* 79* No Nausea 48 57 63* 54 1 Chemotherapy included oral and injectable cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, cisplatin (20 mg/m 2 to 50 mg/m 2 ), dacarbazine, doxorubicin, epirubicin. 2 No vomiting, no moderate or severe nausea, no rescue medication. *Statistically significant (P<0.01) vs. 0.25 mg twice a day. \u2020Statistically significant (P<0.01) vs. 0.5 mg twice a day. Results from a second double-blind, randomized trial evaluating granisetron hydrochloride tablets 2 mg once a day and granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg twice a day were compared to prochlorperazine 10 mg twice a day derived from a historical control. At 24 hours, there was no statistically significant difference in efficacy between the two granisetron hydrochloride tablet regimens. Both regimens were statistically superior to the prochlorperazine control regimen (see Table 3 ).

Results from a granisetron hydrochloride tablets 2 mg daily alone treatment arm in a third double-blind, randomized trial, were compared to prochlorperazine (PCPZ), 10 mg twice a day, derived from a historical control. The 24 hour results for granisetron hydrochloride tablets 2 mg daily were statistically superior to PCPZ for all efficacy parameters: complete response (58%), no vomiting (79%), no nausea (51%), total control (49%). The PCPZ rates are shown in Table 3 . Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy The first double-blind trial compared granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg twice a day, relative to placebo (historical control), in 119 cancer patients receiving high-dose cisplatin (mean dose 80 mg/m 2 ). At 24 hours, granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg twice a day was significantly (P<0.001) superior to placebo (historical control) in all efficacy parameters: complete response (52%), no vomiting (56%) and no nausea (45%). The placebo rates were 7%, 14%, and 7%, respectively, for the three efficacy parameters. Results from a granisetron hydrochloride tablets 2 mg once a day alone treatment arm in a second double-blind, randomized trial, were compared to both granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg twice a day and placebo historical controls. The 24 hour results for granisetron hydrochloride tablets 2 mg once a day were: complete response (44%), no vomiting (58%), no nausea (46%), total control (40%). The efficacy of granisetron hydrochloride tablets 2 mg once a day was comparable to granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg twice a day and statistically superior to placebo. The placebo rates were 7%, 14%, 7%, and 7%, respectively, for the four parameters. No controlled study comparing granisetron injection with the oral formulation to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting has been performed. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Total Body Irradiation In a double-blind randomized study, 18 patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride tablets, 2 mg daily, experienced significantly greater antiemetic protection compared to patients in a historical negative control group who received conventional (non-5-HT 3 antagonist) antiemetics. Total body irradiation consisted of 11 fractions of 120 cGy administered over 4 days, with three fractions on each of the first 3 days, and two fractions on the fourth day. Granisetron hydrochloride tablets were given one hour before the first radiation fraction of each day. Twenty-two percent (22%) of patients treated with granisetron hydrochloride tablets did not experience vomiting or receive rescue antiemetics over the entire 4 day dosing period, compared to 0% of patients in the historical negative control group (P<0.01). In addition, patients who received granisetron hydrochloride tablets also experienced significantly fewer emetic episodes during the first day of radiation and over the 4 day treatment period, compared to patients in the historical negative control group. The median time to the first emetic episode was 36 hours for patients who received granisetron hydrochloride tablets. Fractionated Abdominal Radiation The efficacy of granisetron hydrochloride tablets, 2 mg daily, was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of 260 patients. Granisetron hydrochloride tablets were given 1 hour before radiation, composed of up to 20 daily fractions of 180 to 300 cGy each. The exceptions were patients with seminoma or those receiving whole abdomen irradiation who initially received 150 cGy per fraction. Radiation was administered to the upper abdomen with a field size of at least 100 cm 2 . The proportion of patients without emesis and those without nausea for granisetron hydrochloride tablets, compared to placebo, was statistically significant (P<0.0001) at 24 hours after radiation, irrespective of the radiation dose. Granisetron hydrochloride was superior to placebo in patients receiving up to 10 daily fractions of radiation, but was not superior to placebo in patients receiving 20 fractions. Patients treated with granisetron hydrochloride tablets (n=134) had a significantly longer time to the first episode of vomiting (35 days vs. 9 days, P<0.001) relative to those patients who received placebo (n=126), and a significantly longer time to the first episode of nausea (11 days vs. 1 day, P<0.001). Granisetron hydrochloride provided significantly greater protection from nausea and vomiting than placebo."

      "WARNINGS Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of granisetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue granisetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if granisetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs ( see Drug Interactions , Patient Counseling Information )."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Granisetron hydrochloride is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. The use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. An adequate QT assessment has not been conducted, but QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Therefore, granisetron hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders, as this might lead to clinical consequences. Patients with cardiac disease, on cardio-toxic chemotherapy, with concomitant electrolyte abnormalities and/or on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval are particularly at risk. Drug Interactions Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro . There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, granisetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride in vitro . In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron hydrochloride. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron hydrochloride. The clinical significance of this change is not known. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients concurrently treated with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or are arrhythmogenic, this may result in clinical consequences. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) ( see WARNINGS ). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 24 month carcinogenicity study, rats were treated orally with granisetron 1, 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (6, 30 or 300 mg/m 2 /day). The 50 mg/kg/day dose was reduced to 25 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m 2 /day) during week 59 due to toxicity. For a 50 kg person of average height (1.46 m 2 body surface area), these doses represent 4, 20, and 101 times the recommended clinical dose (1.48 mg/m 2 , oral) on a body surface area basis. There was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas in males treated with 5 mg/kg/day (30 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and above, and in females treated with 25 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m 2 /day, 101 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). No increase in liver tumors was observed at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (6 mg/m 2 /day, 4 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in males and 5 mg/kg/day (30 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in females. In a 12 month oral toxicity study, treatment with granisetron 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m 2 /day, 405 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) produced hepatocellular adenomas in male and female rats while no such tumors were found in the control rats. A 24 month mouse carcinogenicity study of granisetron did not show a statistically significant increase in tumor incidence, but the study was not conclusive. Because of the tumor findings in rat studies, granisetron hydrochloride should be prescribed only at the dose and for the indication recommended (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Granisetron was not mutagenic in in vitro Ames test and mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, and in vivo mouse micronucleus test and in vitro and ex vivo rat hepatocyte UDS assays. It, however, produced a significant increase in UDS in HeLa cells in vitro and a significant increased incidence of cells with polyploidy in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test. Granisetron at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m 2 /day, 405 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B . Reproduction studies have been performed in pregnant rats at oral doses up to 125 mg/kg/day (750 mg/m 2 /day, 507 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 32 mg/kg/day (378 mg/m 2 /day, 255 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to granisetron. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether granisetron is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when granisetron hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use During clinical trials, 325 patients 65 years of age or older received granisetron hydrochloride tablets; 298 were 65 to 74 years of age, and 27 were 75 years of age or older. Efficacy and safety were maintained with increasing age."

      "Drug Interactions Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro . There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, granisetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride in vitro . In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron hydrochloride. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron hydrochloride. The clinical significance of this change is not known. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients concurrently treated with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or are arrhythmogenic, this may result in clinical consequences. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) ( see WARNINGS )."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 24 month carcinogenicity study, rats were treated orally with granisetron 1, 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (6, 30 or 300 mg/m 2 /day). The 50 mg/kg/day dose was reduced to 25 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m 2 /day) during week 59 due to toxicity. For a 50 kg person of average height (1.46 m 2 body surface area), these doses represent 4, 20, and 101 times the recommended clinical dose (1.48 mg/m 2 , oral) on a body surface area basis. There was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas in males treated with 5 mg/kg/day (30 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and above, and in females treated with 25 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m 2 /day, 101 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). No increase in liver tumors was observed at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (6 mg/m 2 /day, 4 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in males and 5 mg/kg/day (30 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in females. In a 12 month oral toxicity study, treatment with granisetron 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m 2 /day, 405 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) produced hepatocellular adenomas in male and female rats while no such tumors were found in the control rats. A 24 month mouse carcinogenicity study of granisetron did not show a statistically significant increase in tumor incidence, but the study was not conclusive. Because of the tumor findings in rat studies, granisetron hydrochloride should be prescribed only at the dose and for the indication recommended (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Granisetron was not mutagenic in in vitro Ames test and mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, and in vivo mouse micronucleus test and in vitro and ex vivo rat hepatocyte UDS assays. It, however, produced a significant increase in UDS in HeLa cells in vitro and a significant increased incidence of cells with polyploidy in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test. Granisetron at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m 2 /day, 405 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

Other adverse events reported in clinical trials were: Gastrointestinal: In single-day dosing studies in which adverse events were collected for 7 days, nausea (20%) and vomiting (12%) were recorded as adverse events after the 24 hour efficacy assessment period. Hepatic: In comparative trials, elevation of AST and ALT (>2 times the upper limit of normal) following the administration of granisetron hydrochloride tablets occurred in 5% and 6% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2%; ALT: 9%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (1%); hypotension, angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, and syncope have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Dizziness (5%), insomnia (5%), anxiety (2%), somnolence (1%). One case compatible with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal symptoms has been reported in a patient treated with granisetron hydrochloride tablets. Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other: Fever (5%). Events often associated with chemotherapy also have been reported: leukopenia (9%), decreased appetite (6%), anemia (4%), alopecia (3%), thrombocytopenia (2%). Over 5000 patients have received injectable granisetron hydrochloride in clinical trials. Table 5 gives the comparative frequencies of the five commonly reported adverse events (\u22653%) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection, 40 mcg/kg, in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy, primarily cisplatin, and intravenous fluids during the 24 hour period following granisetron hydrochloride injection administration.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Granisetron hydrochloride does not stimulate gastric or intestinal peristalsis and should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. (5.1) QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders. (5.2) Hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, and urticaria, may occur in patients with known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. (5.3) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with granisetron products, alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.4) 5.1 Gastric or Intestinal Peristalsis Granisetron hydrochloride is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. The use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. 5.2 Cardiovascular Events An adequate QT assessment has not been conducted, but QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Therefore, granisetron hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders, as this might lead to clinical consequences. Patients with cardiac disease, on cardio-toxic chemotherapy, with concomitant electrolyte abnormalities and/or on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval are particularly at risk. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) may occur in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. 5.4 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of granisetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue granisetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if granisetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]."

Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The following have been reported during controlled clinical trials or in the routine management of patients. The percentage figures are based on clinical trial experience only. Table 1 gives the comparative frequencies of the two most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u2265 3%) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection, in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy, primarily cisplatin, and intravenous fluids during the 24-hour period following granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Reactions were generally recorded over seven days post-granisetron hydrochloride injection administration.

In over 3,000 patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection (2 to 160 mcg/kg) in single-day and multiple-day clinical trials with emetogenic cancer therapies, adverse events, other than those adverse reactions listed in Table 1, were observed; attribution of many of these events to granisetron hydrochloride is uncertain. Hepatic: In comparative trials, mainly with cisplatin regimens, elevations of AST and ALT (> 2 times the upper limit of normal) following administration of granisetron hydrochloride injection occurred in 2.8% and 3.3% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2.1%; ALT: 2.4%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (2%); hypotension, arrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, varying degrees of A-V block, ventricular ectopy including non-sustained tachycardia, and ECG abnormalities have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Agitation, anxiety, CNS stimulation and insomnia were seen in less than 2% of patients. Extrapyramidal syndrome occurred rarely and only in the presence of other drugs associated with this syndrome. Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other: Fever (3%), taste disorder (2%), skin rashes (1%). In multiple-day comparative studies, fever occurred more frequently with granisetron hydrochloride injection (8.6%) than with comparative drugs (3.4%, P < 0.014), which usually included dexamethasone. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse reactions listed in Table 2 were reported in \u2265 2% of adults receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection 1 mg during controlled clinical trials.

In a clinical study conducted in Japan, the types of adverse events differed notably from those reported above in Table 2. The adverse events in the Japanese study that occurred in \u2265 2% of patients and were more frequent with granisetron hydrochloride injection 1 mg than with placebo were: fever (56% to 50%), sputum increased (2.7% to 1.7%), and dermatitis (2.7% to 0%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of granisetron hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to granisetron hydrochloride exposure. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7) ] ."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro . There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, granisetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride in vitro . In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron hydrochloride. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron hydrochloride. The clinical significance of this change is not known. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients concurrently treated with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or are arrhythmogenic may result in clinical consequences. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Granisetron hydrochloride injection has been administered safely with benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and anti-ulcer medications. (7) Does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. (7) Inducers or inhibitors of CYP450 enzymes may change the clearance and therefore the half-life of granisetron. (7) Coadministration of granisetron hydrochloride with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or are arrhythmogenic may result in clinical consequences. (7)"

(8.3) Pediatric use: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established for use in postoperative nausea and vomiting. (8.4) Geriatric use: No differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients were observed in reported clinical experience. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Reproduction studies have been performed in pregnant rats at intravenous doses up to 9 mg/kg/day (54 mg/m 2 /day, 146 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at intravenous doses up to 3 mg/kg/day (35.4 mg/m 2 /day, 96 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to granisetron. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether granisetron is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when granisetron hydrochloride injection is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting [See Dosage and Administration (2) ] for use in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in pediatric patients 2 to 16 years of age. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 2 years of age have not been established. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Granisetron has been evaluated in a pediatric patient clinical trial for use in the prevention of PONV. Due to the lack of efficacy and the QT prolongation observed in this trial, use of granisetron for the prevention of PONV in children is not recommended. The trial was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial that evaluated 157 children aged 2 to 16 years who were undergoing elective surgery for tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. The purpose of the trial was to assess two dose levels (20 mcg/kg and 40 mcg/kg) of intravenous granisetron in the prevention of PONV. There was no active comparator or placebo. The primary endpoint was total control of nausea and vomiting (defined as no nausea, vomiting/retching, or use of rescue medication) in the 24 hours following surgery. Efficacy was not established due to lack of a dose response. The trial also included standard 12 lead ECGs performed pre-dose and after the induction of anesthesia. ECGs were repeated at the end of surgery after the administration of granisetron and just prior to reversal of anesthesia. QT prolongation was seen at both dose levels. Five patients in this trial experienced an increase of \u2265 60 msec in QTcF. In addition, there were two patients whose QTcF was \u2265 500 msec. Interpretation of the QTcF prolongation was confounded by multiple factors, including the use of concomitant medication and the lack of either a placebo or active control. A thorough QT trial in adults has not been performed. Other adverse events that occurred in the study included: vomiting (5 to 8%), post-procedural hemorrhage (3 to 5%), and dehydration (0 to 5%). Pediatric patients under 2 years of age have not been studied. 8.5 Geriatric Use During chemotherapy clinical trials, 713 patients 65 years of age or older received granisetron hydrochloride injection. The safety and effectiveness were similar in patients of various ages. During postoperative nausea and vomiting clinical trials, 168 patients 65 years of age or older, of which 47 were 75 years of age or older, received granisetron hydrochloride injection. Clinical studies of granisetron hydrochloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Granisetron is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT 3 ) receptor antagonist with little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT 1 ; 5-HT 1A ; 5-HT 1B/C ; 5-HT 2 ; for alpha 1 -, alpha 2 - or beta-adrenoreceptors; for dopamine-D 2 ; or for histamine-H 1 ; benzodiazepine; picrotoxin or opioid receptors. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT 3 type are located peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. During chemotherapy-induced vomiting, mucosal enterochromaffin cells release serotonin, which stimulates 5-HT 3 receptors. This evokes vagal afferent discharge and may induce vomiting. Animal studies demonstrate that, in binding to 5-HT 3 receptors, granisetron blocks serotonin stimulation and subsequent vomiting after emetogenic stimuli such as cisplatin. In the ferret animal model, a single granisetron injection prevented vomiting due to high-dose cisplatin or arrested vomiting within 5 to 30 seconds. In most human studies, granisetron has had little effect on blood pressure, heart rate or ECG. No evidence of an effect on plasma prolactin or aldosterone concentrations has been found in other studies. Granisetron hydrochloride injection exhibited no effect on oro-cecal transit time in normal volunteers given a single intravenous infusion of 50 mcg/kg or 200 mcg/kg. Single and multiple oral doses slowed colonic transit in normal volunteers. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting In adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and in volunteers, mean pharmacokinetic data obtained from an infusion of a single 40 mcg/kg dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection are shown in Table 3. Table 3 Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adult Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy and in Volunteers, Following a Single Intravenous 40 mcg/kg Dose of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection * 5-minute infusion. \u2020 3-minute infusion. Peak Plasma Concentration (ng/mL) Terminal Phase Plasma Half-Life (h) Total Clearance (L/h/kg) Volume of Distribution (L/kg) Cancer Patients Mean Range 63.8 * 18 to 176 8.95 * 0.9 to 31.1 0.38 * 0.14 to 1.54 3.07 * 0.85 to 10.4 Volunteers 21 to 42 years Mean Range 64.3 \u2020 11.2 to 182 4.91 \u2020 0.88 to 15.2 0.79 \u2020 0.2 to 2.56 3.04 \u2020 1.68 to 6.13 65 to 81 years Mean Range 57 \u2020 14.6 to 153 7.69 \u2020 2.65 to 17.7 0.44 \u2020 0.17 to 1.06 3.97 \u2020 1.75 to 7.01 Distribution Plasma protein binding is approximately 65% and granisetron distributes freely between plasma and red blood cells. Metabolism Granisetron metabolism involves N-demethylation and aromatic ring oxidation followed by conjugation. In vitro liver microsomal studies show that granisetron\u2019s major route of metabolism is inhibited by ketoconazole, suggestive of metabolism mediated by the cytochrome P-450 3A subfamily. Animal studies suggest that some of the metabolites may also have 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity. Elimination Clearance is predominantly by hepatic metabolism. In normal volunteers, approximately 12% of the administered dose is eliminated unchanged in the urine in 48 hours. The remainder of the dose is excreted as metabolites, 49% in the urine, and 34% in the feces. Subpopulations Gender There was high inter- and intra-subject variability noted in these studies. No difference in mean AUC was found between males and females, although males had a higher C max generally. Elderly The ranges of the pharmacokinetic parameters in elderly volunteers (mean age 71 years), given a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection, were generally similar to those in younger healthy volunteers; mean values were lower for clearance and longer for half-life in the elderly patients (see Table 3). Pediatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study in pediatric cancer patients (2 to 16 years of age), given a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection, showed that volume of distribution and total clearance increased with age. No relationship with age was observed for peak plasma concentration or terminal phase plasma half-life. When volume of distribution and total clearance are adjusted for body weight, the pharmacokinetics of granisetron are similar in pediatric and adult cancer patients. Renal Failure Patients Total clearance of granisetron was not affected in patients with severe renal failure who received a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection. Hepatically Impaired Patients A pharmacokinetic study in patients with hepatic impairment due to neoplastic liver involvement showed that total clearance was approximately halved compared to patients without hepatic impairment. Given the wide variability in pharmacokinetic parameters noted in patients, dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic functional impairment is not necessary. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting In adult patients (age range, 18 to 64 years) recovering from elective surgery and receiving general balanced anesthesia, mean pharmacokinetic data obtained from a single 1 mg dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection administered intravenously over 30 seconds are shown in Table 4. Table 4 Pharmacokinetic Parameters in 16 Adult Surgical Patients Following a Single Intravenous 1 mg Dose of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection Terminal Phase Plasma Half-Life (h) Total Clearance (L/h/kg) Volume of Distribution (L/kg) Mean 8.63 0.28 2.42 Range 1.77 to 17.73 0.07 to 0.71 0.71 to 4.13 The pharmacokinetics of granisetron in patients undergoing surgery were similar to those seen in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Granisetron is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT 3 ) receptor antagonist with little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT 1 ; 5-HT 1A ; 5-HT 1B/C ; 5-HT 2 ; for alpha 1 -, alpha 2 - or beta-adrenoreceptors; for dopamine-D 2 ; or for histamine-H 1 ; benzodiazepine; picrotoxin or opioid receptors. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT 3 type are located peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. During chemotherapy-induced vomiting, mucosal enterochromaffin cells release serotonin, which stimulates 5-HT 3 receptors. This evokes vagal afferent discharge and may induce vomiting. Animal studies demonstrate that, in binding to 5-HT 3 receptors, granisetron blocks serotonin stimulation and subsequent vomiting after emetogenic stimuli such as cisplatin. In the ferret animal model, a single granisetron injection prevented vomiting due to high-dose cisplatin or arrested vomiting within 5 to 30 seconds. In most human studies, granisetron has had little effect on blood pressure, heart rate or ECG. No evidence of an effect on plasma prolactin or aldosterone concentrations has been found in other studies. Granisetron hydrochloride injection exhibited no effect on oro-cecal transit time in normal volunteers given a single intravenous infusion of 50 mcg/kg or 200 mcg/kg. Single and multiple oral doses slowed colonic transit in normal volunteers."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting In adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and in volunteers, mean pharmacokinetic data obtained from an infusion of a single 40 mcg/kg dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection are shown in Table 3. Table 3 Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adult Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy and in Volunteers, Following a Single Intravenous 40 mcg/kg Dose of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection * 5-minute infusion. \u2020 3-minute infusion.

Metabolism Granisetron metabolism involves N-demethylation and aromatic ring oxidation followed by conjugation. In vitro liver microsomal studies show that granisetron\u2019s major route of metabolism is inhibited by ketoconazole, suggestive of metabolism mediated by the cytochrome P-450 3A subfamily. Animal studies suggest that some of the metabolites may also have 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity. Elimination Clearance is predominantly by hepatic metabolism. In normal volunteers, approximately 12% of the administered dose is eliminated unchanged in the urine in 48 hours. The remainder of the dose is excreted as metabolites, 49% in the urine, and 34% in the feces. Subpopulations Gender There was high inter- and intra-subject variability noted in these studies. No difference in mean AUC was found between males and females, although males had a higher C max generally. Elderly The ranges of the pharmacokinetic parameters in elderly volunteers (mean age 71 years), given a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection, were generally similar to those in younger healthy volunteers; mean values were lower for clearance and longer for half-life in the elderly patients (see Table 3). Pediatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study in pediatric cancer patients (2 to 16 years of age), given a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection, showed that volume of distribution and total clearance increased with age. No relationship with age was observed for peak plasma concentration or terminal phase plasma half-life. When volume of distribution and total clearance are adjusted for body weight, the pharmacokinetics of granisetron are similar in pediatric and adult cancer patients. Renal Failure Patients Total clearance of granisetron was not affected in patients with severe renal failure who received a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection. Hepatically Impaired Patients A pharmacokinetic study in patients with hepatic impairment due to neoplastic liver involvement showed that total clearance was approximately halved compared to patients without hepatic impairment. Given the wide variability in pharmacokinetic parameters noted in patients, dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic functional impairment is not necessary. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting In adult patients (age range, 18 to 64 years) recovering from elective surgery and receiving general balanced anesthesia, mean pharmacokinetic data obtained from a single 1 mg dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection administered intravenously over 30 seconds are shown in Table 4.

The 50 mg/kg/day dose was reduced to 25 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m 2 /day) during week 59 due to toxicity. For a 50 kg person of average height (1.46 m 2 body surface area), these doses represent 16, 81 and 405 times the recommended clinical dose (0.37 mg/m 2 , iv) on a body surface area basis. There was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas in males treated with 5 mg/kg/day (30 mg/m 2 /day, 81 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and above, and in females treated with 25 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m 2 /day, 405 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). No increase in liver tumors was observed at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in males and 5 mg/kg/day (30 mg/m 2 /day, 81 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in females. In a 12-month oral toxicity study, treatment with granisetron 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m 2 /day, 1622 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) produced hepatocellular adenomas in male and female rats while no such tumors were found in the control rats. A 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study of granisetron did not show a statistically significant increase in tumor incidence, but the study was not conclusive. Because of the tumor findings in rat studies, granisetron hydrochloride injection should be prescribed only at the dose and for the indication recommended [see Indications and Usage (1) and Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Granisetron was not mutagenic in an in vitro Ames test and mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, and in vivo mouse micronucleus test and in vitro and ex vivo rat hepatocyte UDS assays. It, however, produced a significant increase in UDS in HeLa cells in vitro and a significant increased incidence of cells with polyploidy in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test. Granisetron at subcutaneous doses up to 6 mg/kg/day (36 mg/m 2 /day, 97 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

The 10 mcg/kg dose was at least as effective as the higher doses. Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Granisetron hydrochloride injection, 40 mcg/kg, was compared with the combination of chlorpromazine (50 to 200 mg/24 hours) and dexamethasone (12 mg) in patients treated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, including primarily carboplatin > 300 mg/m 2 , cisplatin 20 to 50 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide > 600 mg/m 2 . Granisetron hydrochloride injection was superior to the chlorpromazine regimen in preventing nausea and vomiting (see Table 8). Table 8 Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting\u2014Single-Day Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy 1 Patients also received dexamethasone, 12 mg. 2 No vomiting and no moderate or severe nausea.

Repeat-Cycle Chemotherapy In an uncontrolled trial, 512 cancer patients received granisetron hydrochloride injection, 40 mcg/kg, prophylactically, for two cycles of chemotherapy, 224 patients received it for at least four cycles, and 108 patients received it for at least six cycles. Granisetron hydrochloride injection efficacy remained relatively constant over the first six repeat cycles, with complete response rates (no vomiting and no moderate or severe nausea in 24 hours) of 60% to 69%. No patients were studied for more than 15 cycles. Pediatric Studies A randomized double-blind study evaluated the 24-hour response of 80 pediatric cancer patients (age 2 to 16 years) to granisetron hydrochloride injection 10, 20 or 40 mcg/kg. Patients were treated with cisplatin \u2265 60 mg/m 2 , cytarabine \u2265 3 g/m 2 , cyclophosphamide \u2265 1 g/m 2 or nitrogen mustard \u2265 6 mg/m 2 (see Table 9).

Granisetron hydrochloride injection was administered on each day of ifosfamide treatment. At 24 hours, 22% of granisetron hydrochloride injection patients achieved complete response (no vomiting and no moderate or severe nausea in 24 hours) compared with 10% on the chlorpromazine regimen. The median number of vomiting episodes with granisetron hydrochloride injection was 1.5; with chlorpromazine it was 7. 14.2 Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The efficacy of granisetron hydrochloride injection for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting was evaluated in 868 patients, of which 833 were women, 35 men, 484 Caucasians, 348 Asians, 18 Blacks, 18 Other, with 61 patients 65 years or older. Granisetron hydrochloride injection was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients who underwent elective gynecological surgery or cholecystectomy and received general anesthesia. Patients received a single intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection (0.1 mg, 1 mg or 3 mg) or placebo either 5 minutes before induction of anesthesia or immediately before reversal of anesthesia. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with no vomiting for 24 hours after surgery. Episodes of nausea and vomiting and use of rescue antiemetic therapy were recorded for 24 hours after surgery. In both studies, granisetron hydrochloride injection (1 mg) was more effective than placebo in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting (see Table 10). No additional benefit was seen in patients who received the 3 mg dose.

Treatment of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The efficacy of granisetron hydrochloride injection for treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting was evaluated in 844 patients, of which 731 were women, 113 men, 777 Caucasians, 6 Asians, 41 Blacks, 20 Other, with 107 patients 65 years or older. Granisetron hydrochloride injection was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of adult surgical patients who received general anesthesia with no prophylactic antiemetic agent, and who experienced nausea or vomiting within 4 hours postoperatively. Patients received a single intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection (0.1 mg, 1 mg or 3 mg) or placebo after experiencing postoperative nausea or vomiting. Episodes of nausea and vomiting and use of rescue antiemetic therapy were recorded for 24 hours after administration of study medication. Granisetron hydrochloride injection was more effective than placebo in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting (see Table 11). No additional benefit was seen in patients who received the 3 mg dose.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Granisetron hydrochloride does not stimulate gastric or intestinal peristalsis and should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, and urticaria, may occur in patients with known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Serotonin syndrome has been reported with granisetron products, alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Gastric or Intestinal Peristalsis Granisetron hydrochloride is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. The use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. 5.2 Cardiovascular Events An adequate QT assessment has not been conducted, but QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Therefore, granisetron hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders, as this might lead to clinical consequences. Patients with cardiac disease, on cardio-toxic chemotherapy, with concomitant electrolyte abnormalities and/or on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval are particularly at risk. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) may occur in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. 5.4 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase Inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of granisetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue granisetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if granisetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) , Patient Counseling Information (17) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Most common adverse reactions: \u2022 Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (\u22653%): Headache, and constipation ( 6.1 ) \u2022 Postoperative nausea and vomiting (\u22652%): Pain, headache, fever, abdominal pain and hepatic enzymes increased ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in patients. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The following have been reported during controlled clinical trials or in the routine management of patients. The percentage figures are based on clinical trial experience only. Table 1 gives the comparative frequencies of the two most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22653%) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection, in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy, primarily cisplatin, and intravenous fluids during the 24-hour period following granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Reactions were generally recorded over seven days post-granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Table 1 Principal Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials\u2014Single-Day Chemotherapy Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 40 mcg/kg (n=1268) Comparator Metoclopramide/dexamethasone and phenothiazines/dexamethasone. (n=422) Headache 14% 6% Constipation 3% 3% Additional adverse events reported in clinical trials were asthenia, somnolence and diarrhea. In over 3,000 patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection (2 to 160 mcg/kg) in single-day and multiple-day clinical trials with emetogenic cancer therapies, adverse events, other than those adverse reactions listed in Table 1, were observed; attribution of many of these events to granisetron hydrochloride injection is uncertain. Hepatic : In comparative trials, mainly with cisplatin regimens, elevations of AST and ALT (>2 times the upper limit of normal) following administration of granisetron hydrochloride injection occurred in 2.8% and 3.3% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2.1%; ALT: 2.4%). Cardiovascular : Hypertension (2%); hypotension, arrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, varying degrees of A-V block, ventricular ectopy including non-sustained tachycardia, and ECG abnormalities have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System : Agitation, anxiety, CNS stimulation and insomnia were seen in less than 2% of patients. Extrapyramidal syndrome occurred rarely and only in the presence of other drugs associated with this syndrome. Hypersensitivity : Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (eg, anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other : Fever (3%), taste disorder (2%), skin rashes (1%). In multiple-day comparative studies, fever occurred more frequently with granisetron hydrochloride injection (8.6%) than with comparative drugs (3.4%, P<0.014), which usually included dexamethasone. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse reactions listed in Table 2 were reported in \u22652% of adults receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection 1 mg during controlled clinical trials. Table 2 Adverse Reactions in Controlled Clinical Trials in Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (Reported in \u2265 2% of Adults Receiving Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 1 mg) Percent of Patients With Reaction Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 1 mg (n=267) Placebo (n=266) Pain 10.1 8.3 Headache 8.6 7.1 Fever 7.9 4.5 Abdominal Pain 6 6 Hepatic Enzymes Increased 5.6 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 3.4 Diarrhea 3.4 1.1 Flatulence 3 3 Dyspepsia 3 1.9 Oliguria 2.2 1.5 Coughing 2.2 1.1 Additional adverse events reported in clinical trials were constipation, anemia, insomnia, bradycardia, leukocytosis, anxiety, hypotension, infection, hypertension, and urinary tract infection. In a clinical study conducted in Japan, the types of adverse events differed notably from those reported above in Table 2. The adverse events in the Japanese study that occurred in \u22652% of patients and were more frequent with granisetron hydrochloride 1 mg than with placebo were: fever (56% to 50%), sputum increased (2.7% to 1.7%), and dermatitis (2.7% to 0%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of granisetron hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to granisetron hydrochloride exposure. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7) ] ."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro . There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, granisetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride in vitro . In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron hydrochloride. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron hydrochloride. The clinical significance of this change is not known. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients concurrently treated with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or are arrhythmogenic may result in clinical consequences. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. \u2022 Granisetron hydrochloride injection has been administered safely with benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and anti-ulcer medications. ( 7 ) \u2022 Does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. ( 7 ) \u2022 Inducers or inhibitors of CYP450 enzymes may change the clearance and therefore the half-life of granisetron.

( 8.3 ) \u2022 Pediatric use: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established for use in postoperative nausea and vomiting. ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric use: No differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients were observed in reported clinical experience. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in pregnant rats at intravenous doses up to 9 mg/kg/day (54 mg/m 2 /day, 146 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at intravenous doses up to 3 mg/kg/day (35.4 mg/m 2 /day, 96 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to granisetron. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether granisetron is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when granisetron hydrochloride injection is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting [See Dosage and Administration (2) ] for use in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in pediatric patients 2 to 16 years of age. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 2 years of age have not been established. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Granisetron has been evaluated in a pediatric patient clinical trial for use in the prevention of PONV. Due to the lack of efficacy and the QT prolongation observed in this trial, use of granisetron for the prevention of PONV in children is not recommended. The trial was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial that evaluated 157 children aged 2 to 16 years who were undergoing elective surgery for tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. The purpose of the trial was to assess two dose levels (20 mcg/kg and 40 mcg/kg) of intravenous granisetron in the prevention of PONV. There was no active comparator or placebo. The primary endpoint was total control of nausea and vomiting (defined as no nausea, vomiting/retching, or use of rescue medication) in the 24 hours following surgery. Efficacy was not established due to lack of a dose response. The trial also included standard 12 lead ECGs performed pre-dose and after the induction of anesthesia. ECGs were repeated at the end of surgery after the administration of granisetron and just prior to reversal of anesthesia. QT prolongation was seen at both dose levels. Five patients in this trial experienced an increase of \u2265 60 msec in QTcF. In addition, there were two patients whose QTcF was \u2265 500 msec. Interpretation of the QTcF prolongation was confounded by multiple factors, including the use of concomitant medication and the lack of either a placebo or active control. A thorough QT trial in adults has not been performed. Other adverse events that occurred in the study included: vomiting (5 to 8%), post-procedural hemorrhage (3 to 5%), and dehydration (0 to 5%). Pediatric patients under 2 years of age have not been studied. 8.5 Geriatric Use During chemotherapy clinical trials, 713 patients 65 years of age or older received granisetron hydrochloride injection. The safety and effectiveness were similar in patients of various ages. During postoperative nausea and vomiting clinical trials, 168 patients 65 years of age or older, of which 47 were 75 years of age or older, received granisetron hydrochloride injection. Clinical studies of granisetron hydrochloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 2 years of age have not been established. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Granisetron has been evaluated in a pediatric patient clinical trial for use in the prevention of PONV. Due to the lack of efficacy and the QT prolongation observed in this trial, use of granisetron for the prevention of PONV in children is not recommended. The trial was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial that evaluated 157 children aged 2 to 16 years who were undergoing elective surgery for tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. The purpose of the trial was to assess two dose levels (20 mcg/kg and 40 mcg/kg) of intravenous granisetron in the prevention of PONV. There was no active comparator or placebo. The primary endpoint was total control of nausea and vomiting (defined as no nausea, vomiting/retching, or use of rescue medication) in the 24 hours following surgery. Efficacy was not established due to lack of a dose response. The trial also included standard 12 lead ECGs performed pre-dose and after the induction of anesthesia. ECGs were repeated at the end of surgery after the administration of granisetron and just prior to reversal of anesthesia. QT prolongation was seen at both dose levels. Five patients in this trial experienced an increase of \u2265 60 msec in QTcF. In addition, there were two patients whose QTcF was \u2265 500 msec. Interpretation of the QTcF prolongation was confounded by multiple factors, including the use of concomitant medication and the lack of either a placebo or active control. A thorough QT trial in adults has not been performed. Other adverse events that occurred in the study included: vomiting (5 to 8%), post-procedural hemorrhage (3 to 5%), and dehydration (0 to 5%).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Granisetron is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT 3 ) receptor antagonist with little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT 1 ; 5-HT 1A ; 5-HT 1B/C ; 5-HT 2 ; for alpha 1 -, alpha 2 - or beta-adrenoreceptors; for dopamine-D 2 ; or for histamine-H 1 ; benzodiazepine; picrotoxin or opioid receptors. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT 3 type are located peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. During chemotherapy-induced vomiting, mucosal enterochromaffin cells release serotonin, which stimulates 5-HT 3 receptors. This evokes vagal afferent discharge and may induce vomiting. Animal studies demonstrate that, in binding to 5-HT 3 receptors, granisetron blocks serotonin stimulation and subsequent vomiting after emetogenic stimuli such as cisplatin. In the ferret animal model, a single granisetron injection prevented vomiting due to high-dose cisplatin or arrested vomiting within 5 to 30 seconds. In most human studies, granisetron has had little effect on blood pressure, heart rate or ECG. No evidence of an effect on plasma prolactin or aldosterone concentrations has been found in other studies. Granisetron hydrochloride injection exhibited no effect on oro-cecal transit time in normal volunteers given a single intravenous infusion of 50 mcg/kg or 200 mcg/kg. Single and multiple oral doses slowed colonic transit in normal volunteers. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting In adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and in volunteers, mean pharmacokinetic data obtained from an infusion of a single 40 mcg/kg dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection are shown in Table 3. Table 3 Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adult Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy and in Volunteers, Following a Single Intravenous 40 mcg/kg Dose of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection Peak Plasma Concentration (ng/mL) Terminal Phase Plasma Half-Life (h) Total Clearance (L/h/kg) Volume of Distribution (L/kg) Cancer Patients Mean 63.8 5-minute infusion 8.95 0.38 3.07 Range 18 to 176 0.90 to 31.1 0.14 to 1.54 0.85 to 10.4 Volunteers 21 to 42 years Mean 64.3 3- minute infusion 4.91 0.79 3.04 Range 11.2 to 182 0.88 to 15.2 0.20 to 2.56 1.68 to 6.13 65 to 81 years Mean 57 7.69 0.44 3.97 Range 14.6 to 153 2.65 to 17.7 0.17 to 1.06 1.75 to 7.01 Distribution Plasma protein binding is approximately 65% and granisetron distributes freely between plasma and red blood cells. Metabolism Granisetron metabolism involves N-demethylation and aromatic ring oxidation followed by conjugation. In vitro liver microsomal studies show that granisetron\u2019s major route of metabolism is inhibited by ketoconazole, suggestive of metabolism mediated by the cytochrome P-450 3A subfamily. Animal studies suggest that some of the metabolites may also have 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity. Elimination Clearance is predominantly by hepatic metabolism. In normal volunteers, approximately 12% of the administered dose is eliminated unchanged in the urine in 48 hours. The remainder of the dose is excreted as metabolites, 49% in the urine, and 34% in the feces. Subpopulations Gender There was high inter- and intra-subject variability noted in these studies. No difference in mean AUC was found between males and females, although males had a higher C max generally. Elderly The ranges of the pharmacokinetic parameters in elderly volunteers (mean age 71 years), given a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection, were generally similar to those in younger healthy volunteers; mean values were lower for clearance and longer for half-life in the elderly patients (see Table 3). Pediatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study in pediatric cancer patients (2 to 16 years of age), given a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection, showed that volume of distribution and total clearance increased with age. No relationship with age was observed for peak plasma concentration or terminal phase plasma half-life. When volume of distribution and total clearance are adjusted for body weight, the pharmacokinetics of granisetron are similar in pediatric and adult cancer patients. Renal Failure Patients Total clearance of granisetron was not affected in patients with severe renal failure who received a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection. Hepatically Impaired Patients A pharmacokinetic study in patients with hepatic impairment due to neoplastic liver involvement showed that total clearance was approximately halved compared to patients without hepatic impairment. Given the wide variability in pharmacokinetic parameters noted in patients, dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic functional impairment is not necessary. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting In adult patients (age range, 18 to 64 years) recovering from elective surgery and receiving general balanced anesthesia, mean pharmacokinetic data obtained from a single 1 mg dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection administered intravenously over 30 seconds are shown in Table 4. Table 4 Pharmacokinetic Parameters in 16 Adult Surgical Patients Following a Single Intravenous 1 mg Dose of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection Terminal Phase Plasma Half-Life (h) TotalClearance (L/h/kg) Volume ofDistribution (L/kg) Mean 8.63 0.28 2.42 Range 1.77 to 17.73 0.07 to 0.71 0.71 to 4.13 The pharmacokinetics of granisetron in patients undergoing surgery were similar to those seen in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 24-month carcinogenicity study, rats were treated orally with granisetron 1, 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (6, 30 or 300 mg/m 2 /day). The 50 mg/kg/day dose was reduced to 25 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m 2 /day) during week 59 due to toxicity. For a 50 kg person of average height (1.46 m 2 body surface area), these doses represent 16, 81 and 405 times the recommended clinical dose (0.37 mg/m 2 , iv) on a body surface area basis. There was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas in males treated with 5 mg/kg/day (30 mg/m 2 /day, 81 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and above, and in females treated with 25 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m 2 /day, 405 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). No increase in liver tumors was observed at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in males and 5 mg/kg/day (30 mg/m 2 /day, 81 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in females. In a 12-month oral toxicity study, treatment with granisetron 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m 2 /day, 1622 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) produced hepatocellular adenomas in male and female rats while no such tumors were found in the control rats. A 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study of granisetron did not show a statistically significant increase in tumor incidence, but the study was not conclusive. Because of the tumor findings in rat studies, granisetron hydrochloride injection should be prescribed only at the dose and for the indication recommended [see Indications and Usage (1) and Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Granisetron was not mutagenic in an in vitro Ames test and mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, and in vivo mouse micronucleus test and in vitro and ex vivo rat hepatocyte UDS assays. It, however, produced a significant increase in UDS in HeLa cells in vitro and a significant increased incidence of cells with polyploidy in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test. Granisetron at subcutaneous doses up to 6 mg/kg/day (36 mg/m 2 /day, 97 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Single-Day Chemotherapy Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 28 cancer patients, granisetron hydrochloride injection, administered as a single intravenous infusion of 40 mcg/kg, was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing nausea and vomiting induced by cisplatin chemotherapy (see Table 5). Table 5 Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting\u2014Single-Day Cisplatin Therapy 1 Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection Placebo P-Value Number of Patients 14 14 Response Over 24 Hours Complete Response No vomiting and no moderate or severe nausea. 93% 7% <0.001 No Vomiting 93% 14% <0.001 No More Than Mild Nausea 93% 7% <0.001 1 Cisplatin administration began within 10 minutes of granisetron hydrochloride injection infusion and continued for 1.5 to 3 hours. Mean cisplatin dose was 86 mg/m2 in the granisetron hydrochloride injection group and 80 mg/m2 in the placebo group. Granisetron hydrochloride injection was also evaluated in a randomized dose response study of cancer patients receiving cisplatin \u226575 mg/m 2 . Additional chemotherapeutic agents included: anthracyclines, carboplatin, cytostatic antibiotics, folic acid derivatives, methylhydrazine, nitrogen mustard analogs, podophyllotoxin derivatives, pyrimidine analogs, and vinca alkaloids. Granisetron hydrochloride injection doses of 10 and 40 mcg/kg were superior to 2 mcg/kg in preventing cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting, but 40 mcg/kg was not significantly superior to 10 mcg/kg (see Table 6).

For both the low and high cisplatin strata, the 10, 20, and 40 mcg/kg doses were more effective than the 5 mcg/kg dose in preventing nausea and vomiting within 24 hours of chemotherapy administration. The 10 mcg/kg dose was at least as effective as the higher doses. Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Granisetron hydrochloride injection, 40 mcg/kg, was compared with the combination of chlorpromazine (50 to 200 mg/24 hours) and dexamethasone (12 mg) in patients treated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, including primarily carboplatin >300 mg/m 2 , cisplatin 20 to 50 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide >600 mg/m 2 . Granisetron hydrochloride injection was superior to the chlorpromazine regimen in preventing nausea and vomiting (see Table 8). Table 8 Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting\u2014Single-Day Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection Chlorpromazine Patients also received dexamethasone, 12 mg. P-Value Number of Patients 133 133 Response Over 24 Hours Complete Response No vomiting and no moderate or severe nausea. 68% 47% <0.001 No Vomiting 73% 53% <0.001 No More Than Mild Nausea 77% 59% <0.001 In other studies of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, no significant difference in efficacy was found between granisetron hydrochloride injection doses of 40 mcg/kg and 160 mcg/kg. Repeat-Cycle Chemotherapy In an uncontrolled trial, 512 cancer patients received granisetron hydrochloride injection, 40 mcg/kg, prophylactically, for two cycles of chemotherapy, 224 patients received it for at least four cycles, and 108 patients received it for at least six cycles. Granisetron hydrochloride injection efficacy remained relatively constant over the first six repeat cycles, with complete response rates (no vomiting and no moderate or severe nausea in 24 hours) of 60% to 69%. No patients were studied for more than 15 cycles. Pediatric Studies A randomized double-blind study evaluated the 24-hour response of 80 pediatric cancer patients (age 2 to 16 years) to granisetron hydrochloride injection 10, 20 or 40 mcg/kg. Patients were treated with cisplatin \u226560 mg/m 2 , cytarabine \u22653 g/m 2 , cyclophosphamide \u22651 g/m 2 or nitrogen mustard \u22656 mg/m 2 (see Table 9).

Granisetron hydrochloride injection was administered on each day of ifosfamide treatment. At 24 hours, 22% of granisetron hydrochloride injection patients achieved complete response (no vomiting and no moderate or severe nausea in 24 hours) compared with 10% on the chlorpromazine regimen. The median number of vomiting episodes with granisetron hydrochloride injection was 1.5; with chlorpromazine it was 7. 14.2 Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The efficacy of granisetron hydrochloride injection for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting was evaluated in 868 patients, of which 833 were women, 35 men, 484 Caucasians, 348 Asians, 18 Blacks, 18 Other, with 61 patients 65 years or older. Granisetron hydrochloride was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients who underwent elective gynecological surgery or cholecystectomy and received general anesthesia. Patients received a single intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection (0.1 mg, 1 mg or 3 mg) or placebo either 5 minutes before induction of anesthesia or immediately before reversal of anesthesia. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with no vomiting for 24 hours after surgery. Episodes of nausea and vomiting and use of rescue antiemetic therapy were recorded for 24 hours after surgery. In both studies, granisetron hydrochloride injection (1 mg) was more effective than placebo in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting (see Table 10). No additional benefit was seen in patients who received the 3 mg dose.

Treatment of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The efficacy of granisetron hydrochloride injection for treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting was evaluated in 844 patients, of which 731 were women, 113 men, 777 Caucasians, 6 Asians, 41 Blacks, 20 Other, with 107 patients 65 years or older. Granisetron hydrochloride injection was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of adult surgical patients who received general anesthesia with no prophylactic antiemetic agent, and who experienced nausea or vomiting within 4 hours postoperatively. Patients received a single intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection (0.1 mg, 1 mg or 3 mg) or placebo after experiencing postoperative nausea or vomiting. Episodes of nausea and vomiting and use of rescue antiemetic therapy were recorded for 24 hours after administration of study medication. Granisetron hydrochloride injection was more effective than placebo in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting (see Table 11). No additional benefit was seen in patients who received the 3 mg dose.

      "CLINICAL TRIALS Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Granisetron hydrochloride tablets prevent nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer therapy, as shown by 24 hour efficacy data from studies using both moderately- and highly-emetogenic chemotherapy. Moderatly Emetogenic Chemotherapy The first trial compared granisetron hydrochloride tablets doses of 0.25 mg to 2 mg twice a day, in 930 cancer patients receiving, principally, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, and cisplatin (20 mg/m 2 to 50 mg/m 2 ). Efficacy was based on complete response (i.e., no vomiting, no moderate or severe nausea, no rescue medication), no vomiting, and no nausea. Table 2 summarizes the results of this study. Table 2: Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting 24 Hours Post-Chemotherapy* *Chemotherapy included oral and injectable cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, cisplatin (20 mg/m 2 to 50 mg/m 2 ), dacarbazine, doxorubicin, epirubicin. \u2020 No vomiting, no moderate or severe nausea, no rescue medication. \u2021 Statistically significant (p<0.01) vs. 0.25 mg bid. \u00a7 Statistically significant (p<0.01) vs. 0.5 mg bid.

At 24 hours, there was no statistically significant difference in efficacy between the two granisetron hydrochloride tablet regimens. Both regimens were statistically superior to the prochlorperazine control regimen (see Table 3 ). Table 3: Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting 24 Hours Post-Chemotherapy* *Moderately emetogenic chemotherapeutic agents included cisplatin (20 mg/m 2 to 50 mg/m 2 ), oral and intravenous cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, dacarbazine, doxorubicin. \u2020 Historical control from a previous double-blind granisetron hydrochloride trial. \u2021 No vomiting, no moderate or severe nausea, no rescue medication. \u00a7 Statistically significant (p<0.05) vs. prochlorperazine historical control. \u00b6 No vomiting, no nausea, no rescue medication.

The 24 hour results for granisetron hydrochloride tablets 2 mg daily were statistically superior to PCPZ for all efficacy parameters: complete response (58%), no vomiting (79%), no nausea (51%), total control (49%). The PCPZ rates are shown in Table 3. Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy The first double-blind trial compared granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg bid, relative to placebo (historical control), in 119 cancer patients receiving high-dose cisplatin (mean dose 80 mg/m 2 ). At 24 hours, granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg bid was significantly (p<0.001) superior to placebo (historical control) in all efficacy parameters: complete response (52%), no vomiting (56%) and no nausea (45%). The placebo rates were 7%, 14%, and 7%, respectively, for the three efficacy parameters. Results from a granisetron hydrochloride tablets 2 mg once a day alone treatment arm in a second double-blind, randomized trial, were compared to both granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg twice a day and placebo historical controls. The 24 hour results for granisetron hydrochloride tablets 2 mg once a day were: complete response (44%), no vomiting (58%), no nausea (46%), total control (40%). The efficacy of granisetron hydrochloride tablets 2 mg once a day was comparable to granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg twice a day and statistically superior to placebo. The placebo rates were 7%, 14%, 7%, and 7%, respectively, for the four parameters. No controlled study comparing granisetron injection with the oral formulation to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting has been performed. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Total Body Irradiation In a double-blind randomized study, 18 patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride tablets, 2 mg daily, experienced significantly greater antiemetic protection compared to patients in a historical negative control group who received conventional (non-5-HT 3 antagonist) antiemetics. Total body irradiation consisted of 11 fractions of 120 cGy administered over 4 days, with three fractions on each of the first 3 days, and two fractions on the fourth day. Granisetron hydrochloride tablets were given one hour before the first radiation fraction of each day. Twenty-two percent (22%) of patients treated with granisetron hydrochloride tablets did not experience vomiting or receive rescue antiemetics over the entire 4-day dosing period, compared to 0% of patients in the historical negative control group (p<0.01). In addition, patients who received granisetron hydrochloride tablets also experienced significantly fewer emetic episodes during the first day of radiation and over the 4 day treatment period, compared to patients in the historical negative control group. The median time to the first emetic episode was 36 hours for patients who received granisetron hydrochloride tablets. Fractionated Abdominal Radiation The efficacy of granisetron hydrochloride tablets, 2 mg daily, was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of 260 patients. granisetron hydrochloride tablets were given 1 hour before radiation, composed of up to 20 daily fractions of 180 to 300 cGy each. The exceptions were patients with seminoma or those receiving whole abdomen irradiation who initially received 150 cGy per fraction. Radiation was administered to the upper abdomen with a field size of at least 100 cm 2 . The proportion of patients without emesis and those without nausea for granisetron hydrochloride tablets, compared to placebo, was statistically significant (p<0.0001) at 24 hours after radiation, irrespective of the radiation dose. Granisetron hydrochloride was superior to placebo in patients receiving up to 10 daily fractions of radiation, but was not superior to placebo in patients receiving 20 fractions. Patients treated with granisetron hydrochloride tablets (n=134) had a significantly longer time to the first episode of vomiting (35 days vs. 9 days, p<0.001) relative to those patients who received placebo (n=126), and a significantly longer time to the first episode of nausea (11 days vs. 1 day, p<0.001). granisetron hydrochloride provided significantly greater protection from nausea and vomiting than placebo."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Granisetron is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT 3 ) receptor antagonist with little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT 1 ; 5-HT 1A ; 5-HT 1B/C ; 5-HT 2 ; for alpha 1 -, alpha 2 -, or beta-adrenoreceptors; for dopamine-D 2 ; or for histamine-H 1 ; benzodiazepine; picrotoxin or opioid receptors. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT 3 type are located peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. During chemotherapy that induces vomiting, mucosal enterochromaffin cells release serotonin, which stimulates 5-HT 3 receptors. This evokes vagal afferent discharge, inducing vomiting. Animal studies demonstrate that, in binding to 5-HT 3 receptors, granisetron blocks serotonin stimulation and subsequent vomiting after emetogenic stimuli such as cisplatin. In the ferret animal model, a single granisetron injection prevented vomiting due to high-dose cisplatin or arrested vomiting within 5 to 30 seconds. In most human studies, granisetron has had little effect on blood pressure, heart rate or ECG. No evidence of an effect on plasma prolactin or aldosterone concentrations has been found in other studies. Following single and multiple oral doses, granisetron hydrochloride tablets slowed colonic transit in normal volunteers. However, granisetron hydrochloride had no effect on oro-cecal transit time in normal volunteers when given as a single intravenous (IV) infusion of 50 mcg/kg or 200 mcg/kg. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers and adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, administration of granisetron hydrochloride tablets produced mean pharmacokinetic data shown in Table 1. Table 1: Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Median [range]) Following Granisetron hydrochloride Tablets * Not determined after oral administration; following a single intravenous dose of 40 mcg/kg, terminal phase half-life was determined to be 8.95 hours. Peak Plasma Concentration (ng/mL) Terminal Phase Plasma Half-Life (h) Volume of Distribution (L/kg) Total Clearance (L/h/kg) Cancer Patients 1 mg bid, 7 days (n=27) 5.99 [0.63 to 30.9] N.D. * N.D. 0.52 [0.09 to 7.37] Volunteers single 1 mg dose (n=39) 3.63 [0.27 to 9.14] 6.23 [0.96 to 19.9] 3.94 [1.89 to 39.4] 0.41 [0.11 to 24.6] Absorption When granisetron tablets were administered with food, AUC was decreased by 5% and C max increased by 30% in non-fasted healthy volunteers who received a single dose of 10 mg. Distribution Plasma protein binding is approximately 65% and granisetron distributes freely between plasma and red blood cells. Metabolism Granisetron metabolism involves N-demethylation and aromatic ring oxidation followed by conjugation. In vitro liver microsomal studies show that granisetron's major route of metabolism is inhibited by ketoconazole, suggestive of metabolism mediated by the cytochrome P-450 3A subfamily. Animal studies suggest that some of the metabolites may also have 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity. Elimination Clearance is predominantly by hepatic metabolism. In normal volunteers, approximately 11% of the orally administered dose is eliminated unchanged in the urine in 48 hours. The remainder of the dose is excreted as metabolites, 48% in the urine and 38% in the feces. Subpopulations Gender The effects of gender on the pharmacokinetics of granisetron hydrochloride tablets have not been studied. However, after intravenous infusion of granisetron hydrochloride, no difference in mean AUC was found between males and females, although males had a higher C max generally. In elderly and pediatric patients and in patients with renal failure or hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of granisetron was determined following administration of intravenous granisetron. Elderly The ranges of the pharmacokinetic parameters in elderly volunteers (mean age 71 years), given a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection, were generally similar to those in younger healthy volunteers; mean values were lower for clearance and longer for half-life in the elderly. Renal Failure Patients Total clearance of granisetron was not affected in patients with severe renal failure who received a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection. Hepatically Impaired Patients A pharmacokinetic study with intravenous granisetron hydrochloride in patients with hepatic impairment due to neoplastic liver involvement showed that total clearance was approximately halved compared to patients without hepatic impairment. Given the wide variability in pharmacokinetic parameters noted in patients, dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic functional impairment is not necessary. Pediatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study in pediatric cancer patients (2 to 16 years of age), given a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection, showed that volume of distribution and total clearance increased with age. No relationship with age was observed for peak plasma concentration or terminal phase plasma half-life. When volume of distribution and total clearance are adjusted for body weight, the pharmacokinetics of granisetron are similar in pediatric and adult cancer patients"

      "WARNINGS Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagoinist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of granisetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue granisetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if granisetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs (see Drug Interactions and Patient Counseling Information )."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Granisetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. The use of granisetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. An adequate QT assessment has not been conducted, but QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron. Therefore, granisetron should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders, as this might lead to clinical consequences. Patients with cardiac disease, on cardio-toxic chemotherapy, with concomitant electrolyte abnormalities and/or on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval are particularly at risk. Drug Interactions Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro . There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, granisetron hydrochloride Injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride Injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride in vitro. In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron. The clinical significance of this change is not known. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients concurrently treated with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or are arrhythmogenic may result in clinical consequences. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings]. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 24 month carcinogenicity study, rats were treated orally with granisetron 1, 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (6, 30 or 300 mg/m 2 /day). The 50mg/kg/day dose was reduced to 25 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m 2 /day) during week 59 due to toxicity. For a 50 kg person of average height (1.46 m 2 body surface area), these doses represent 4, 20, and 101 times the recommended clinical dose (1.48 mg/m 2 , oral) on a body surface area basis. There was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas in males treated with 5 mg/kg/day (30 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and above, and in females treated with 25 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m 2 /day, 101 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). No increase in liver tumors was observed at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (6 mg/m 2 /day, 4 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in males and 5 mg/kg/day (30 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in females. In a 12 month oral toxicity study, treatment with granisetron 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m 2 /day, 405 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) produced hepatocellular adenomas in male and female rats while no such tumors were found in the control rats. A 24 month mouse carcinogenicity study of granisetron did not show a statistically significant increase in tumor incidence, but the study was not conclusive. Because of the tumor findings in rat studies, granisetron hydrochloride should be prescribed only at the dose and for the indication recommended (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Granisetron was not mutagenic in in vitro Ames test and mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, and in vivo mouse micronucleus test and in vitro and ex vivo rat hepatocyte UDS assays. It, however, produced a significant increase in UDS in HeLa cells in vitro and a significant increased incidence of cells with polyploidy in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test. Granisetron at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m 2 /day, 405 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B . Reproduction studies have been performed in pregnant rats at oral doses up to 125 mg/kg/day (750 mg/m 2 /day, 507 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 32 mg/kg/day (378 mg/m 2 /day, 255 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to granisetron. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether granisetron is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when granisetron hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use During clinical trials, 325 patients 65 years of age or older received granisetron hydrochloride tablets; 298 were 65 to 74 years of age, and 27 were 75 years of age or older. Efficacy and safety were maintained with increasing age."

      "Drug Interactions Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro . There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, granisetron hydrochloride Injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride Injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride in vitro. In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron. The clinical significance of this change is not known. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients concurrently treated with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or are arrhythmogenic may result in clinical consequences. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings]."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride (see PRECAUTIONS and Drug Interactions ). Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Over 3700 patients have received granisetron hydrochloride tablets in clinical trials with emetogenic cancer therapies consisting primarily of cyclophosphamide or cisplatin regimens. In patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg bid for 1, 7 or 14 days, or 2 mg daily for 1 day, adverse experiences reported in more than 5% of the patients with comparator and placebo incidences are listed in Table 4. Table 4: Principal Adverse Events in Clinical Trials * Adverse events were recorded for 7 days when granisetron hydrochloride tablets were given on a single day and for up to 28 days when granisetron hydrochloride tablets were administered for 7 or 14 days. \u2020 Metoclopramide/dexamethasone; phenothiazines/dexamethasone; dexamethasone alone; prochlorperazine. \u2021 Usually mild to moderate in severity. Percent of Patients With Even Granisetron hydrochloride Tablets * 1 mg twice a day (n=978) Granisetron hydrochloride Tablets * 2 mg once a day (n=1450) Comparator \u2020 (n=599) Placebo (n=185) Headache 21% 20% 13% 12% Constipation 18% 14% 16% 8% Asthenia 14% 18% 10% 4% Diarrhea 8% 9% 10% 4% Abdominal pain 6% 4% 6% 3% Dyspepsia 4% 6% 5% 4% Other adverse events reported in clinical trials were: Gastrointestinal: In single-day dosing studies in which adverse events were collected for 7 days, nausea (20%) and vomiting (12%) were recorded as adverse events after the 24 hour efficacy assessment period. Hepatic: In comparative trials, elevation of AST and ALT (>2 times the upper limit of normal) following the administration of granisetron hydrochloride tablets occurred in 5% and 6% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2%; ALT: 9%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (1%); hypotension, angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, and syncope have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Dizziness (5%), insomnia (5%), anxiety (2%), somnolence (1%). One case compatible with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal symptoms has been reported in a patient treated with granisetron tablets. Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (eg, anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other: Fever (5%). Events often associated with chemotherapy also have been reported: leukopenia (9%), decreased appetite (6%), anemia (4%), alopecia (3%), thrombocytopenia (2%). Over 5000 patients have received injectable granisetron hydrochloride in clinical trials. Table 5 gives the comparative frequencies of the five commonly reported adverse events (\u22653%) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection, 40 mcg/kg, in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy, primarily cisplatin, and intravenous fluids during the 24 hour period following granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Table 5: Principal Adverse Events in Clinical Trials \u2014 Single-Day Chemotherapy Percent of Patients with Event Granisetron hydrochloride Injection * 40mcg/kg (n=1268) Comparator \u2020 (n=422) Headache 14% 6% Asthenia 5% 6% Somnolence 4% 15% Diarrhea 4% 6% Constipation 3% 3% * Adverse events were generally recorded over 7 days post- granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. \u2020 Metoclopramide/dexamethasone and phenothiazines/dexamethasone. In the absence of a placebo group, there is uncertainty as to how many of these events should be attributed to granisetron, except for headache, which was clearly more frequent than in comparison groups. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting In controlled clinical trials, the adverse events reported by patients receiving granisetron tablets and concurrent radiation were similar to those reported by patients receiving granisetron tablets prior to chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea, asthenia, and constipation. Headache, however, was less prevalent in this patient population. Postmarketing Experience QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron ( see PRECAUTIONS and Drug Interactions )."

      "CLINICAL TRIALS Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Granisetron hydrochloride tablets prevent nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer therapy, as shown by 24 hour efficacy data from studies using both moderately- and highly-emetogenic chemotherapy. Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy The first trial compared granisetron hydrochloride tablet doses of 0.25 mg to 2 mg twice a day, in 930 cancer patients receiving, principally, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, and cisplatin (20 mg/m 2 to 50 mg/m 2 ). Efficacy was based on complete response (i.e., no vomiting, no moderate or severe nausea, no rescue medication), no vomiting, and no nausea. Table 2 summarizes the results of this study. Table 2: Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting 24 Hours Post-Chemotherapy Chemotherapy included oral and injectable cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, cisplatin (20 mg/m 2 to 50 mg/m 2 ), dacarbazine, doxorubicin, epirubicin. Percentages of Patients Granisetron Hydrochloride Tablet Dose Efficacy Measures 0.25 mg twice a day (N = 229) % 0.5 mg twice a day (N = 235) % 1 mg twice a day (N = 233) % 2 mg twice a day (N = 233) % Complete Response No vomiting, no moderate or severe nausea, no rescue medication. 61 70 Statistically significant (p < 0.01) vs. 0.25 mg bid. 81 Statistically significant (p < 0.01) vs. 0.5 mg bid. 72 No Vomiting 66 77 88 79 No Nausea 48 57 63 54 Results from a second double-blind, randomized trial evaluating granisetron hydrochloride tablets 2 mg once a day and granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg twice a day were compared to prochlorperazine 10 mg twice a day derived from a historical control. At 24 hours, there was no statistically significant difference in efficacy between the two granisetron hydrochloride tablet regimens. Both regimens were statistically superior to the prochlorperazine control regimen (see Table 3 ). Table 3: Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting 24 Hours Post-Chemotherapy Moderately emetogenic chemotherapeutic agents included cisplatin (20 mg/m 2 to 50 mg/m 2 ), oral and intravenous cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, dacarbazine, doxorubicin.

The 24 hour results for granisetron hydrochloride tablets 2 mg daily were statistically superior to PCPZ for all efficacy parameters: complete response (58%), no vomiting (79%), no nausea (51%), total control (49%). The PCPZ rates are shown in Table 3 . Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy The first double-blind trial compared granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg bid, relative to placebo (historical control), in 119 cancer patients receiving high-dose cisplatin (mean dose 80 mg/m 2 ). At 24 hours, granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg bid was significantly (p < 0.001) superior to placebo (historical control) in all efficacy parameters: complete response (52%), no vomiting (56%) and no nausea (45%). The placebo rates were 7%, 14%, and 7%, respectively, for the three efficacy parameters. Results from a granisetron hydrochloride tablets 2 mg once a day alone treatment arm in a second double-blind, randomized trial, were compared to both granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg twice a day and placebo historical controls. The 24 hour results for granisetron hydrochloride tablets 2 mg once a day were: complete response (44%), no vomiting (58%), no nausea (46%), total control (40%). The efficacy of granisetron hydrochloride tablets 2 mg once a day was comparable to granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg twice a day and statistically superior to placebo. The placebo rates were 7%, 14%, 7%, and 7%, respectively, for the four parameters. No controlled study comparing granisetron injection with the oral formulation to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting has been performed. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Total Body Irradiation In a double-blind randomized study, 18 patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride tablets, 2 mg daily, experienced significantly greater antiemetic protection compared to patients in a historical negative control group who received conventional (non-5-HT 3 antagonist) antiemetics. Total body irradiation consisted of 11 fractions of 120 cGy administered over 4 days, with three fractions on each of the first 3 days, and two fractions on the fourth day. Granisetron hydrochloride tablets were given one hour before the first radiation fraction of each day. Twenty-two percent (22%) of patients treated with granisetron hydrochloride tablets did not experience vomiting or receive rescue antiemetics over the entire 4 day dosing period, compared to 0% of patients in the historical negative control group (p < 0.01). In addition, patients who received granisetron hydrochloride tablets also experienced significantly fewer emetic episodes during the first day of radiation and over the 4 day treatment period, compared to patients in the historical negative control group. The median time to the first emetic episode was 36 hours for patients who received granisetron hydrochloride tablets. Fractionated Abdominal Radiation The efficacy of granisetron hydrochloride tablets, 2 mg daily, was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of 260 patients. Granisetron hydrochloride tablets were given 1 hour before radiation, composed of up to 20 daily fractions of 180 to 300 cGy each. The exceptions were patients with seminoma or those receiving whole abdomen irradiation who initially received 150 cGy per fraction. Radiation was administered to the upper abdomen with a field size of at least 100 cm 2 . The proportion of patients without emesis and those without nausea for granisetron hydrochloride tablets, compared to placebo, was statistically significant (p < 0.0001) at 24 hours after radiation, irrespective of the radiation dose. Granisetron hydrochloride was superior to placebo in patients receiving up to 10 daily fractions of radiation, but was not superior to placebo in patients receiving 20 fractions. Patients treated with granisetron hydrochloride tablets (N = 134) had a significantly longer time to the first episode of vomiting (35 days vs. 9 days, p < 0.001) relative to those patients who received placebo (N = 126), and a significantly longer time to the first episode of nausea (11 days vs. 1 day, p < 0.001). Granisetron hydrochloride provided significantly greater protection from nausea and vomiting than placebo.",

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Granisetron is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT 3 ) receptor antagonist with little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT 1 ; 5-HT 1A ; 5-HT 1B/C ; 5-HT 2 ; for alpha 1- , alpha 2- , or beta-adrenoreceptors; for dopamine-D 2 ; or for histamine-H 1 ; benzodiazepine; picrotoxin or opioid receptors. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT 3 type are located peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. During chemotherapy that induces vomiting, mucosal enterochromaffin cells release serotonin, which stimulates 5-HT 3 receptors. This evokes vagal afferent discharge, inducing vomiting. Animal studies demonstrate that, in binding to 5-HT 3 receptors, granisetron blocks serotonin stimulation and subsequent vomiting after emetogenic stimuli such as cisplatin. In the ferret animal model, a single granisetron injection prevented vomiting due to high-dose cisplatin or arrested vomiting within 5 to 30 seconds. In most human studies, granisetron has had little effect on blood pressure, heart rate or ECG. No evidence of an effect on plasma prolactin or aldosterone concentrations has been found in other studies. Following single and multiple oral doses, granisetron hydrochloride tablets slowed colonic transit in normal volunteers. However, granisetron hydrochloride had no effect on oro-cecal transit time in normal volunteers when given as a single intravenous (IV) infusion of 50 mcg/kg or 200 mcg/kg. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers and adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, administration of granisetron hydrochloride tablets produced mean pharmacokinetic data shown in Table 1 . Table 1: Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Median [range]) Following Granisetron Hydrochloride Tablets, USP Peak Plasma Concentration (ng/mL) Terminal Phase Plasma Half-Life (h) Volume of Distribution (L/kg) Total Clearance (L/h/kg) Cancer Patients 1 mg bid, 7 days (N = 27) 5.99 [0.63 to 30.9] N.D. Not determined after oral administration; following a single intravenous dose of 40 mcg/kg, terminal phase half-life was determined to be 8.95 hours. N.D. 0.52 [0.09 to 7.37] Volunteers single 1 mg dose (N = 39) 3.63 [0.27 to 9.14] 6.23 [0.96 to 19.9] 3.94 [1.89 to 39.4] 0.41 [0.11 to 24.6] Absorption When granisetron tablets were administered with food, AUC was decreased by 5% and C max increased by 30% in non-fasted healthy volunteers who received a single dose of 10 mg. Distribution Plasma protein binding is approximately 65% and granisetron distributes freely between plasma and red blood cells. Metabolism Granisetron metabolism involves N-demethylation and aromatic ring oxidation followed by conjugation. In vitro liver microsomal studies show that granisetron's major route of metabolism is inhibited by ketoconazole, suggestive of metabolism mediated by the cytochrome P-450 3A subfamily. Animal studies suggest that some of the metabolites may also have 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity. Elimination Clearance is predominantly by hepatic metabolism. In normal volunteers, approximately 11% of the orally administered dose is eliminated unchanged in the urine in 48 hours. The remainder of the dose is excreted as metabolites, 48% in the urine and 38% in the feces. Subpopulations Gender The effects of gender on the pharmacokinetics of granisetron hydrochloride tablets have not been studied. However, after intravenous infusion of granisetron hydrochloride, no difference in mean AUC was found between males and females, although males had a higher C max generally. In elderly and pediatric patients and in patients with renal failure or hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of granisetron was determined following administration of intravenous granisetron. Elderly The ranges of the pharmacokinetic parameters in elderly volunteers (mean age 71 years), given a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection, were generally similar to those in younger healthy volunteers; mean values were lower for clearance and longer for half-life in the elderly. Renal Failure Patients Total clearance of granisetron was not affected in patients with severe renal failure who received a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection. Hepatically Impaired Patients A pharmacokinetic study with intravenous granisetron hydrochloride in patients with hepatic impairment due to neoplastic liver involvement showed that total clearance was approximately halved compared to patients without hepatic impairment. Given the wide variability in pharmacokinetic parameters noted in patients, dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic functional impairment is not necessary. Pediatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study in pediatric cancer patients (2 to 16 years of age), given a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection, showed that volume of distribution and total clearance increased with age. No relationship with age was observed for peak plasma concentration or terminal phase plasma half-life. When volume of distribution and total clearance are adjusted for body weight, the pharmacokinetics of granisetron are similar in pediatric and adult cancer patients."

      "WARNINGS Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of granisetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue granisetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if granisetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs (see Drug Interactions and Patient Counseling Information )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Granisetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. The use of granisetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. An adequate QT assessment has not been conducted, but QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Therefore, granisetron hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders, as this might lead to clinical consequences. Patients with cardiac disease, on cardio-toxic chemotherapy, with concomitant electrolyte abnormalities and/or on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval are particularly at risk. Drug Interactions Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro . There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, granisetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron in vitro . In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron. The clinical significance of this change is not known. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients concurrently treated with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or are arrhythmogenic may result in clinical consequences. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see WARNINGS ) . Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 24 month carcinogenicity study, rats were treated orally with granisetron 1, 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (6, 30 or 300 mg/m 2 /day). The 50 mg/kg/day dose was reduced to 25 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m 2 /day) during week 59 due to toxicity. For a 50 kg person of average height (1.46 m 2 body surface area), these doses represent 4, 20, and 101 times the recommended clinical dose (1.48 mg/m 2 , oral) on a body surface area basis. There was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas in males treated with 5 mg/kg/day (30 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and above, and in females treated with 25 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m 2 /day, 101 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). No increase in liver tumors was observed at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (6 mg/m 2 /day, 4 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in males and 5 mg/kg/day (30 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in females. In a 12 month oral toxicity study, treatment with granisetron 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m 2 /day, 405 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) produced hepatocellular adenomas in male and female rats while no such tumors were found in the control rats. A 24 month mouse carcinogenicity study of granisetron did not show a statistically significant increase in tumor incidence, but the study was not conclusive. Because of the tumor findings in rat studies, granisetron hydrochloride should be prescribed only at the dose and for the indication recommended (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) . Granisetron was not mutagenic in in vitro Ames test and mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, and in vivo mouse micronucleus test and in vitro and ex vivo rat hepatocyte UDS assays. It, however, produced a significant increase in UDS in HeLa cells in vitro and a significant increased incidence of cells with polyploidy in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test. Granisetron at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m 2 /day, 405 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in pregnant rats at oral doses up to 125 mg/kg/day (750 mg/m 2 /day, 507 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 32 mg/kg/day (378 mg/m 2 /day, 255 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to granisetron. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether granisetron is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when granisetron hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use During clinical trials, 325 patients 65 years of age or older received granisetron hydrochloride tablets; 298 were 65 to 74 years of age, and 27 were 75 years of age or older. Efficacy and safety were maintained with increasing age."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro . There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, granisetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron in vitro . In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron. The clinical significance of this change is not known. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients concurrently treated with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or are arrhythmogenic may result in clinical consequences. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see WARNINGS ) ."

The 50 mg/kg/day dose was reduced to 25 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m 2 /day) during week 59 due to toxicity. For a 50 kg person of average height (1.46 m 2 body surface area), these doses represent 4, 20, and 101 times the recommended clinical dose (1.48 mg/m 2 , oral) on a body surface area basis.

Hepatic: In comparative trials, elevation of AST and ALT (> 2 times the upper limit of normal) following the administration of granisetron hydrochloride tablets occurred in 5% and 6% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2%; ALT: 9%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (1%); hypotension, angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, and syncope have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Dizziness (5%), insomnia (5%), anxiety (2%), somnolence (1%). One case compatible with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal symptoms has been reported in a patient treated with granisetron hydrochloride tablets. Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other: Fever (5%). Events often associated with chemotherapy also have been reported: leukopenia (9%), decreased appetite (6%), anemia (4%), alopecia (3%), thrombocytopenia (2%). Over 5000 patients have received injectable granisetron hydrochloride in clinical trials. Table 5 gives the comparative frequencies of the five commonly reported adverse events (\u2265 3%) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection, 40 mcg/kg, in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy, primarily cisplatin, and intravenous fluids during the 24 hour period following granisetron hydrochloride injection administration.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Granisetron hydrochloride does not stimulate gastric or intestinal peristalsis and should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. ( 5.1 ) QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, and urticaria, may occur in patients with known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. ( 5.3 ) Contains benzyl alcohol. ( 5.4 ) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with granisetron products, alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Gastric or Intestinal Peristalsis Granisetron hydrochloride is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. The use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. 5.2 Cardiovascular Events An adequate QT assessment has not been conducted, but QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Therefore, granisetron hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders, as this might lead to clinical consequences. Patients with cardiac disease, on cardio-toxic chemotherapy, with concomitant electrolyte abnormalities and/or on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval are particularly at risk. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) may occur in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists 5.4 Benzyl Alcohol Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 1 mg/mL contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol, a component of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 1 mg/mL, has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death, particularly in neonates. The \u201cgasping syndrome,\u201d characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and metabolites in blood and urine, has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low birth-weight neonates. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \u201cgasping syndrome,\u201d the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low birth-weight infants, as well as patients receiving high dosages, may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources. 5.5 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of granisetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue granisetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if granisetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Most common adverse reactions: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (\u22653%): Headache, and constipation ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-845-0689 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www . fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in patients. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The following have been reported during controlled clinical trials or in the routine management of patients. The percentage figures are based on clinical trial experience only. Table 1 gives the comparative frequencies of the two most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22653%) in patients receiving Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection, in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy, primarily cisplatin, and intravenous fluids during the 24-hour period following Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection administration. Reactions were generally recorded over seven days post-Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection administration. Table 1. Principal Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials \u2014 Single-Day Chemotherapy Percent of Patients With Reaction Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 40 mcg/kg (n=1268) Comparator Metoclopramide/dexamethasone and phenothiazines/dexamethasone. (n=422) Headache 14% 6% Constipation 3% 3% Additional adverse events reported in clinical trials were asthenia, somnolence and diarrhea. In over 3,000 patients receiving Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection (2 to 160 mcg/kg) in single-day and multiple-day clinical trials with emetogenic cancer therapies, adverse events, other than those adverse reactions listed in Table 1, were observed; attribution of many of these events to granisetron hydrochloride is uncertain. Hepatic: In comparative trials, mainly with cisplatin regimens, elevations of AST and ALT (>2 times the upper limit of normal) following administration of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection occurred in 2.8% and 3.3% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2.1%; ALT: 2.4%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (2%); hypotension, arrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, varying degrees of A-V block, ventricular ectopy including non-sustained tachycardia, and ECG abnormalities have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Agitation, anxiety, CNS stimulation and insomnia were seen in less than 2% of patients. Extrapyramidal syndrome occurred rarely and only in the presence of other drugs associated with this syndrome. Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (eg, anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other: Fever (3%), taste disorder (2%), skin rashes (1%). In multiple-day comparative studies, fever occurred more frequently with Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection (8.6%) than with comparative drugs (3.4%, P<0.014), which usually included dexamethasone. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of granisetron hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to granisetron hydrochloride exposure. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] ."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro . There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride in vitro . In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron hydrochloride. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron hydrochloride. The clinical significance of this change is not known. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients concurrently treated with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or are arrhythmogenic may result in clinical consequences. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection, USP has been administered safely with benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and anti-ulcer medications. ( 7 ) Does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. ( 7 ) Inducers or inhibitors of CYP450 enzymes may change the clearance and therefore the half-life of granisetron.

The trial was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial that evaluated 157 children aged 2 to 16 years who were undergoing elective surgery for tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. The purpose of the trial was to assess two dose levels (20 mcg/kg and 40 mcg/kg) of intravenous granisetron in the prevention of PONV. There was no active comparator or placebo. The primary endpoint was total control of nausea and vomiting (defined as no nausea, vomiting/retching, or use of rescue medication) in the 24 hours following surgery. Efficacy was not established due to lack of a dose response. The trial also included standard 12 lead ECGs performed pre-dose and after the induction of anesthesia.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Granisetron is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT 3 ) receptor antagonist with little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT 1 ; 5-HT 1A ; 5-HT 1B/C ; 5-HT 2 ; for alpha 1- , alpha 2- or beta-adrenoreceptors; for dopamine-D 2 ; or for histamine-H 1 ; benzodiazepine; picrotoxin or opioid receptors. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT 3 type are located peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. During chemotherapy-induced vomiting, mucosal enterochromaffin cells release serotonin, which stimulates 5-HT 3 receptors. This evokes vagal afferent discharge and may induce vomiting. Animal studies demonstrate that, in binding to 5-HT 3 receptors, granisetron blocks serotonin stimulation and subsequent vomiting after emetogenic stimuli such as cisplatin. In the ferret animal model, a single granisetron injection prevented vomiting due to high-dose cisplatin or arrested vomiting within 5 to 30 seconds. In most human studies, granisetron has had little effect on blood pressure, heart rate or ECG. No evidence of an effect on plasma prolactin or aldosterone concentrations has been found in other studies. Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection exhibited no effect on oro-cecal transit time in normal volunteers given a single intravenous infusion of 50 mcg/kg or 200 mcg/kg. Single and multiple oral doses slowed colonic transit in normal volunteers. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting In adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and in volunteers, mean pharmacokinetic data obtained from an infusion of a single 40 mcg/kg dose of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection are shown in Table 2. Table 2. Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adult Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy and in Volunteers, Following a Single Intravenous 40 mcg/kg Dose of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection Peak Plasma Concentration (ng/mL) Terminal Phase Plasma Half-Life (h) Total Clearance (L/h/kg) Volume of Distribution (L/kg) Cancer Patients Mean 63.8 5-minute infusion. 8.95 0.38 3.07 Range 18.0 to 176 0.90 to 31.1 0.14 to 1.54 0.85 to 10.4 Volunteers 21 to 42 years Mean 64.3 3-minute infusion. 4.91 0.79 3.04 Range 11.2 to 182 0.88 to 15.2 0.20 to 2.56 1.68 to 6.13 65 to 81 years Mean 57.0 7.69 0.44 3.97 Range 14.6 to 153 2.65 to 17.7 0.17 to 1.06 1.75 to 7.01 Distribution Plasma protein binding is approximately 65% and granisetron distributes freely between plasma and red blood cells. Metabolism Granisetron metabolism involves N-demethylation and aromatic ring oxidation followed by conjugation. In vitro liver microsomal studies show that granisetron\u2019s major route of metabolism is inhibited by ketoconazole, suggestive of metabolism mediated by the cytochrome P-450 3A subfamily. Animal studies suggest that some of the metabolites may also have 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity. Elimination Clearance is predominantly by hepatic metabolism. In normal volunteers, approximately 12% of the administered dose is eliminated unchanged in the urine in 48 hours. The remainder of the dose is excreted as metabolites, 49% in the urine, and 34% in the feces. Subpopulations Gender There was high inter- and intra-subject variability noted in these studies. No difference in mean AUC was found between males and females, although males had a higher Cmax generally. Elderly The ranges of the pharmacokinetic parameters in elderly volunteers (mean age 71 years), given a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection, were generally similar to those in younger healthy volunteers; mean values were lower for clearance and longer for half-life in the elderly patients (see Table 2). Pediatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study in pediatric cancer patients (2 to 16 years of age), given a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection, showed that volume of distribution and total clearance increased with age. No relationship with age was observed for peak plasma concentration or terminal phase plasma half-life. When volume of distribution and total clearance are adjusted for body weight, the pharmacokinetics of granisetron are similar in pediatric and adult cancer patients. Renal Failure Patients Total clearance of granisetron was not affected in patients with severe renal failure who received a single 40 mcg/kg intravenous dose of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection. Hepatically Impaired Patients A pharmacokinetic study in patients with hepatic impairment due to neoplastic liver involvement showed that total clearance was approximately halved compared to patients without hepatic impairment. Given the wide variability in pharmacokinetic parameters noted in patients, dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic functional impairment is not necessary."

Hepatically Impaired Patients A pharmacokinetic study in patients with hepatic impairment due to neoplastic liver involvement showed that total clearance was approximately halved compared to patients without hepatic impairment. Given the wide variability in pharmacokinetic parameters noted in patients, dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic functional impairment is not necessary."

The 50 mg/kg/day dose was reduced to 25 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m2/day) during week 59 due to toxicity. For a 50 kg person of average height (1.46 m2 body surface area), these doses represent 16, 81 and 405 times the recommended clinical dose (0.37 mg/m2, iv) on a body surface area basis. There was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas in males treated with 5 mg/kg/day (30 mg/m2/day, 81 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and above, and in females treated with 25 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m2/day, 405 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). No increase in liver tumors was observed at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (6 mg/m2/day, 16 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in males and 5 mg/kg/day (30 mg/m2/day, 81 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in females. In a 12-month oral toxicity study, treatment with granisetron 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m2/day, 1622 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) produced hepatocellular adenomas in male and female rats while no such tumors were found in the control rats. A 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study of granisetron did not show a statistically significant increase in tumor incidence, but the study was not conclusive. Because of the tumor findings in rat studies, Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection should be prescribed only at the dose and for the indication recommended [see Indications and Usage (1) and Dosage and Administration (2)] . Granisetron was not mutagenic in an in vitro Ames test and mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, and in vivo mouse micronucleus test and in vitro and ex vivo rat hepatocyte UDS assays. It, however, produced a significant increase in UDS in HeLa cells in vitro and a significant increased incidence of cells with polyploidy in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test. Granisetron at subcutaneous doses up to 6 mg/kg/day (36 mg/m2/day, 97 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Single-Day Chemotherapy Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 28 cancer patients, Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection, administered as a single intravenous infusion of 40 mcg/kg, was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing nausea and vomiting induced by cisplatin chemotherapy (see Table 3). Table 3. Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting - Single-Day Cisplatin Therapy Cisplatin administration began within 10 minutes of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection infusion and continued for 1.5 to 3.0 hours. Mean cisplatin dose was 86 mg/m 2 in the Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection group and 80 mg/m 2 in the placebo group. Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection Placebo P-Value Number of Patients 14 14 Response Over 24 Hours Complete Response No vomiting and no moderate or severe nausea. 93% 7% <0.001 No Vomiting 93% 14% <0.001 No More Than Mild Nausea 93% 7% <0.001 Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection was also evaluated in a randomized dose response study of cancer patients receiving cisplatin \u226575 mg/m 2 . Additional chemotherapeutic agents included: anthracyclines, carboplatin, cytostatic antibiotics, folic acid derivatives, methylhydrazine, nitrogen mustard analogs, podophyllotoxin derivatives, pyrimidine analogs, and vinca alkaloids. Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection doses of 10 and 40 mcg/kg were superior to 2 mcg/kg in preventing cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting, but 40 mcg/kg was not significantly superior to 10 mcg/kg (see Table 4). Table 4. Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting \u2014 Single-Day High-Dose Cisplatin Therapy Cisplatin administration began within 10 minutes of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection infusion and continued for 2.6 hours (mean).

The 10 mcg/kg dose was at least as effective as the higher doses. Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection, 40 mcg/kg, was compared with the combination of chlorpromazine (50 to 200 mg/24 hours) and dexamethasone (12 mg) in patients treated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, including primarily carboplatin >300 mg/m2, cisplatin 20 to 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide >600 mg/m2. Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection was superior to the chlorpromazine regimen in preventing nausea and vomiting (see Table 6). Table 6. Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting \u2014 Single-Day Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection Chlorpromazine Patients also received dexamethasone, 12 mg. P-Value Number of Patients 133 133 Response Over 24 Hours Complete Response No vomiting and no moderate or severe nausea. 68% 47% <0.001 No Vomiting 73% 53% <0.001 No More Than Mild Nausea 77% 59% <0.001 In other studies of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, no significant difference in efficacy was found between granisetron hydrochloride doses of 40 mcg/kg and 160 mcg/kg. Repeat-Cycle Chemotherapy In an uncontrolled trial, 512 cancer patients received Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection, 40 mcg/kg, prophylactically, for two cycles of chemotherapy, 224 patients received it for at least four cycles, and 108 patients received it for at least six cycles. Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection efficacy remained relatively constant over the first six repeat cycles, with complete response rates (no vomiting and no moderate or severe nausea in 24 hours) of 60% to 69%. No patients were studied for more than 15 cycles. Pediatric Studies A randomized double-blind study evaluated the 24-hour response of 80 pediatric cancer patients (age 2 to 16 years) to Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 10, 20 or 40 mcg/kg. Patients were treated with cisplatin \u226560 mg/m 2 , cytarabine \u22653 g/m 2 , cyclophosphamide \u22651 g/m 2 or nitrogen mustard \u22656 mg/m 2 (see Table 7). Table 7.

Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection was administered on each day of ifosfamide treatment. At 24 hours, 22% of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection patients achieved complete response (no vomiting and no moderate or severe nausea in 24 hours) compared with 10% on the chlorpromazine regimen. The median number of vomiting episodes with Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection was 1.5; with chlorpromazine it was 7."
