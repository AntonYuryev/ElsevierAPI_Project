      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. (5.1) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl capsules contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl capsules. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. (5.2) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. (5.3) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR= 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F 1 or F 2 ). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl capsules was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl capsules with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl have not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R - and S -warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

Hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas of the mesenteric lymph node, the site of drug absorption, were observed in females at clinically relevant exposures based on body surface area comparisons across species relative to the maximum clinical dose of 4 g/day. Overall incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in all vascular tissues did not increase with treatment. In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice with oral gavage doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4.6 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, drug-related incidences of benign squamous cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the tail was observed in high dose male mice. The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice. Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation. In an oral gavage rat fertility study, ethyl-EPA, administered at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 g/kg/day to male rats for 9 weeks before mating and to female rats for 14 days before mating through day 7 of gestation, increased anogenital distance in female pups and increased cervical ribs were observed at 3 g/kg/day (7 times human systemic exposure with 4 g/day clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison)."

Tell your doctor if you get any symptoms of heart rhythm problems such as feeling as if your heart is beating fast and irregular, lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or you faint. Possible allergic reactions if you are allergic to fish or shellfish. Stop taking icosapent ethyl capsules and tell your doctor right away or get emergency medical help if you have any signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction. Bleeding. Serious bleeding can happen in people who take icosapent ethyl capsules. Your risk of bleeding may increase if you are also taking a blood thinner medicine. If you have liver problems and are taking icosapent ethyl capsules, your doctor should do blood tests during treatment. The most common side effects of icosapent ethyl capsules include: Muscle and joint pain. Swelling of the hands, legs, or feet. Constipation Gout Heart rhythm problems (atrial fibrillation). These are not all the possible side effects of icosapent ethyl capsules. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. ( 5.1 ) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. ( 5.2 ) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR= 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions to icosapent ethyl and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. 5.3 Bleeding Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 patients, 482 (12%) patients receiving icosapent ethyl experienced a bleeding event compared to 404 (10%) patients receiving placebo. Serious bleeding events occurred in 111 (3%) of patients on icosapent ethyl vs. 85 (2%) of patients receiving placebo.

Common adverse reactions (incidence \u22653% on icosapent ethyl and \u22651% more frequent than placebo) included musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, constipation, gout, and atrial fibrillation. Hypertriglyceridemia Trials In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with triglyceride levels between 200 and 2000 mg/dL treated for 12 weeks, adverse reactions reported with icosapent ethyl at an incidence \u22651% more frequent than placebo based on pooled data included arthralgia and oropharyngeal pain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of icosapent ethyl. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Diarrhea \u2022 Blood triglycerides increased \u2022 Abdominal discomfort \u2022 Pain in the extremities"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F1 or F2). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl has not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin: In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R - and S -warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin: In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

Hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas of the mesenteric lymph node, the site of drug absorption, were observed in females at clinically relevant exposures based on body surface area comparisons across species relative to the maximum clinical dose of 4 g/day. Overall incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in all vascular tissues did not increase with treatment. In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice with oral gavage doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4.6 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, drug-related incidences of benign squamous cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the tail was observed in high dose male mice. The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice. Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation. In an oral gavage rat fertility study, ethyl-EPA, administered at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 g/kg/day to male rats for 9 weeks before mating and to female rats for 14 days before mating through day 7 of gestation, increased anogenital distance in female pups and increased cervical ribs were observed at 3 g/kg/day (7 times human systemic exposure with 4 g/day clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison)."

The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. ( 5.1 ) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. ( 5.2 ) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR= 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish.

Common adverse reactions (incidence \u22653% on icosapent ethyl and \u22651% more frequent than placebo) included musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, constipation, gout, and atrial fibrillation. Hypertriglyceridemia Trials In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with triglyceride levels between 200 and 2000 mg/dL treated for 12 weeks, adverse reactions reported with icosapent ethyl at an incidence \u22651% more frequent than placebo based on pooled data included arthralgia and oropharyngeal pain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of icosapent ethyl. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7 to 17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F 1 or F 2 ). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F 2 ) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl have not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when coadministered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R - and S -warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when coadministered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when coadministered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl with or following a meal.

Hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas of the mesenteric lymph node, the site of drug absorption, were observed in females at clinically relevant exposures based on body surface area comparisons across species relative to the maximum clinical dose of 4 g/day. Overall incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in all vascular tissues did not increase with treatment. In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice with oral gavage doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4.6 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, drug-related incidences of benign squamous cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the tail was observed in high dose male mice. The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice. Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation. In an oral gavage rat fertility study, ethyl-EPA, administered at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 g/kg/day to male rats for 9 weeks before mating and to female rats for 14 days before mating through day 7 of gestation, increased anogenital distance in female pups and increased cervical ribs were observed at 3 g/kg/day (7 times human systemic exposure with 4 g/day clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison)."

Patients whose baseline TG levels were between 500 and 2,000 mg/dL were enrolled in this study for 12 weeks. The median baseline TG and LDL-C levels in these patients were 684 mg/dL and 86 mg/dL, respectively. Median baseline HDL-C level was 27 mg/dL. The randomized population in this study was mostly Caucasian (88%) and male (76%). The mean age was 53 years and the mean body mass index was 31 kg/m 2 . Twenty-five percent of patients were on concomitant statin therapy, 28% were diabetics, and 39% of the patients had TG levels >750 mg/dL. The changes in the major lipoprotein lipid parameters for the groups receiving icosapent ethyl or placebo are shown in Table 2. Table 2.

The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. ( 5.1 ) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. ( 5.2 ) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR= 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F1 or F2). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl has not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin: In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R - and S -warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin: In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study with oral gavage doses of 0.09, 0.27, and 0.91 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, respectively, males did not exhibit drug-related neoplasms. Hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas of the mesenteric lymph node, the site of drug absorption, were observed in females at clinically relevant exposures based on body surface area comparisons across species relative to the maximum clinical dose of 4 g/day. Overall incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in all vascular tissues did not increase with treatment. In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice with oral gavage doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4.6 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, drug-related incidences of benign squamous cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the tail was observed in high dose male mice. The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice. Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation. In an oral gavage rat fertility study, ethyl-EPA, administered at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 g/kg/day to male rats for 9 weeks before mating and to female rats for 14 days before mating through day 7 of gestation, increased anogenital distance in female pups and increased cervical ribs were observed at 3 g/kg/day (7 times human systemic exposure with 4 g/day clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.2 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia The effects of icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day were assessed in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study of adult patients (76 on icosapent ethyl, 75 on placebo) with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Patients whose baseline TG levels were between 500 and 2,000 mg/dL were enrolled in this study for 12 weeks. The median baseline TG and LDL-C levels in these patients were 684 mg/dL and 86 mg/dL, respectively. Median baseline HDL-C level was 27 mg/dL. The randomized population in this study was mostly Caucasian (88%) and male (76%). The mean age was 53 years and the mean body mass index was 31 kg/m 2 . Twenty-five percent of patients were on concomitant statin therapy, 28% were diabetics, and 39% of the patients had TG levels >750 mg/dL.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F 1 or F 2 ). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl capsules, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl capsules."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl capsules 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl capsules were administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl capsules with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl have not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R - and S -warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice. Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation. In an oral gavage rat fertility study, ethyl-EPA, administered at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 g/kg/day to male rats for 9 weeks before mating and to female rats for 14 days before mating through day 7 of gestation, increased anogenital distance in female pups and increased cervical ribs were observed at 3 g/kg/day (7 times human systemic exposure with 4 g/day clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.2 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia The effects of icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day were assessed in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study of adult patients (76 on icosapent ethyl, 75 on placebo) with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Patients whose baseline TG levels were between 500 and 2,000 mg/dL were enrolled in this study for 12 weeks. The median baseline TG and LDL-C levels in these patients were 684 mg/dL and 86 mg/dL, respectively. Median baseline HDL-C level was 27 mg/dL. The randomized population in this study was mostly Caucasian (88%) and male (76%). The mean age was 53 years and the mean body mass index was 31 kg/m 2 . Twenty-five percent of patients were on concomitant statin therapy, 28% were diabetics, and 39% of the patients had TG levels >750 mg/dL. The changes in the major lipoprotein lipid parameters for the groups receiving icosapent ethyl or placebo are shown in Table 2. Table 2.

The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. ( 5.1 ) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl capsules contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl capsules. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl capsules and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. ( 5.2 ) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl capsules were associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl capsules are associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl capsules compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR=1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl capsules contain ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl capsules.

Common adverse reactions (incidence \u22653% on icosapent ethyl capsules and \u22651% more frequent than placebo) included musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, constipation, gout, and atrial fibrillation. Hypertriglyceridemia Trials In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with triglyceride levels between 200 and 2000 mg/dL treated for 12 weeks, adverse reactions reported with icosapent ethyl capsules at an incidence \u22651% more frequent than placebo based on pooled data included arthralgia and oropharyngeal pain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of icosapent ethyl capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F1 or F2). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea, number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl capsules."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl capsules 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl capsules with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady-state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl have not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin: In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R- and S- warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin: In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

The median baseline TG and LDL-C levels in these patients were 684 mg/dL and 86 mg/dL, respectively. Median baseline HDL-C level was 27 mg/dL. The randomized population in this study was mostly Caucasian (88%) and male (76%). The mean age was 53 years and the mean body mass index was 31 kg/m 2 . Twenty-five percent of patients were on concomitant statin therapy, 28% were diabetics, and 39% of the patients had TG levels >750 mg/dL. The changes in the major lipoprotein lipid parameters for the groups receiving icosapent ethyl or placebo are shown in Table 2 . Table 2.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. (5.1) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl capsules contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl capsules. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. (5.2) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. (5.3) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR= 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions to icosapent ethyl and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. 5.3 Bleeding Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 patients, 482 (12%) patients receiving icosapent ethyl experienced a bleeding event compared to 404 (10%) patients receiving placebo. Serious bleeding events occurred in 111 (3%) of patients on icosapent ethyl vs. 85 (2%) of patients receiving placebo. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin."

Common adverse reactions (incidence \u22653% on icosapent ethyl and \u22651% more frequent than placebo) included musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, constipation, gout, and atrial fibrillation. Hypertriglyceridemia Trials In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with triglyceride levels between 200 and 2000 mg/dL treated for 12 weeks, adverse reactions reported with icosapent ethyl at an incidence \u22651% more frequent than placebo based on pooled data included arthralgia and oropharyngeal pain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of icosapent ethyl capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F 1 or F 2 ). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl."

Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F 1 or F 2 ). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl capsules was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl capsules with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl have not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R - and S -warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study with oral gavage doses of 0.09, 0.27, and 0.91 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, respectively, males did not exhibit drug-related neoplasms. Hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas of the mesenteric lymph node, the site of drug absorption, were observed in females at clinically relevant exposures based on body surface area comparisons across species relative to the maximum clinical dose of 4 g/day. Overall incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in all vascular tissues did not increase with treatment. In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice with oral gavage doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4.6 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, drug-related incidences of benign squamous cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the tail was observed in high dose male mice. The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice. Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation. In an oral gavage rat fertility study, ethyl-EPA, administered at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 g/kg/day to male rats for 9 weeks before mating and to female rats for 14 days before mating through day 7 of gestation, increased anogenital distance in female pups and increased cervical ribs were observed at 3 g/kg/day (7 times human systemic exposure with 4 g/day clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.2 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia The effects of icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day were assessed in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study of adult patients (76 on icosapent ethyl, 75 on placebo) with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Patients whose baseline TG levels were between 500 and 2,000 mg/dL were enrolled in this study for 12 weeks. The median baseline TG and LDL-C levels in these patients were 684 mg/dL and 86 mg/dL, respectively. Median baseline HDL-C level was 27 mg/dL. The randomized population in this study was mostly Caucasian (88%) and male (76%). The mean age was 53 years and the mean body mass index was 31 kg/m 2 . Twenty-five percent of patients were on concomitant statin therapy, 28% were diabetics, and 39% of the patients had TG levels >750 mg/dL. The changes in the major lipoprotein lipid parameters for the groups receiving icosapent ethyl or placebo are shown in Table 2. Table 2.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. ( 5.1 ) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. ( 5.2 ) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR= 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)].

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F1 or F2). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea, number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl has not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin: In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R - and S -warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin: In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

( 5.3 ) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR= 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions to icosapent ethyl and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. 5.3 Bleeding Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo- controlled trial of 8,179 patients, 482 (12%) patients receiving icosapent ethyl experienced a bleeding event compared to 404 (10%) patients receiving placebo. Serious bleeding events occurred in 111 (3%) of patients on icosapent ethyl vs. 85 (2%) of patients receiving placebo. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin."

Common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 3% on icosapent ethyl and \u2265 1% more frequent than placebo) included musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, constipation, gout, and atrial fibrillation. Hypertriglyceridemia Trials In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with triglyceride levels between 200 and 2000 mg/dL treated for 12 weeks, adverse reactions reported with icosapent ethyl at an incidence \u2265 1% more frequent than placebo based on pooled data included arthralgia and oropharyngeal pain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of icosapent ethyl. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7 to 17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F1 or F2). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea, number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl has not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R- and S- warfarin or the anticoagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. ( 5.1 ) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. ( 5.2 ) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR= 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions to icosapent ethyl and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. 5.3 Bleeding Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 patients, 482 (12%) patients receiving icosapent ethyl experienced a bleeding event compared to 404 (10%) patients receiving placebo. Serious bleeding events occurred in 111 (3%) of patients on icosapent ethyl vs. 85 (2%) of patients receiving placebo.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F1 or F2). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F1 or F2). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl has not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin: In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R - and S -warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin: In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

Hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas of the mesenteric lymph node, the site of drug absorption, were observed in females at clinically relevant exposures based on body surface area comparisons across species relative to the maximum clinical dose of 4 g/day. Overall incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in all vascular tissues did not increase with treatment. In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice with oral gavage doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4.6 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, drug-related incidences of benign squamous cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the tail was observed in high dose male mice. The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice. Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation. In an oral gavage rat fertility study, ethyl-EPA, administered at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 g/kg/day to male rats for 9 weeks before mating and to female rats for 14 days before mating through day 7 of gestation, increased anogenital distance in female pups and increased cervical ribs were observed at 3 g/kg/day (7 times human systemic exposure with 4 g/day clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison)."

How should I take icosapent ethyl? \u2022 Take icosapent ethyl exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. \u2022 Do not change your dose or stop taking icosapent ethyl without talking to your doctor. \u2022 Do not take more capsules than what is prescribed by your doctor. o If you are prescribed the 0.5-gram capsules, you should not take more than 8 capsules each day with food. o If you are prescribed the 1-gram capsules, you should not take more than 4 capsules each day with food. \u2022 Take icosapent ethyl capsules whole. Do not break, crush, dissolve, or chew icosapent ethyl capsules before swallowing. \u2022 If you miss a dose of icosapent ethyl, take it as soon as you remember. However, if you miss one day of icosapent ethyl, do not double your dose when you take it. \u2022 Your doctor may start you on a diet that is low in saturated fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, and low in added sugars before giving you icosapent ethyl. Stay on this diet while taking icosapent ethyl. \u2022 Your doctor may do blood tests to check your triglyceride and other lipid levels while you take icosapent ethyl. What are the possible side effects of icosapent ethyl? Icosapent ethyl may cause serious side effects, including: \u2022 Heart rhythm problems (atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter). Heart rhythm problems which can be serious and cause hospitalization have happened in people who take icosapent ethyl, especially in people who have heart (cardiovascular) disease or diabetes with a risk factor for heart (cardiovascular) disease, or who have had heart rhythm problems in the past. Tell your doctor if you get any symptoms of heart rhythm problems such as feeling as if your heart is beating fast and irregular, lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or you faint. \u2022 Possible allergic reactions if you are allergic to fish or shellfish. Stop taking icosapent ethyl and tell your doctor right away or get emergency medical help if you have any signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction. \u2022 Bleeding . Serious bleeding can happen in people who take icosapent ethyl. Your risk of bleeding may increase if you are also taking a blood thinner medicine. If you have liver problems and are taking icosapent ethyl, your doctor should do blood tests during treatment. The most common side effects of icosapent ethyl include: \u2022 Muscle and joint pain. \u2022 Swelling of the hands, legs, or feet. \u2022 Constipation \u2022 Gout \u2022 Heart rhythm problems (atrial fibrillation). These are not all the possible side effects of icosapent ethyl. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. How should I store Icosapent Ethyl Capsules? \u2022 Store icosapent ethyl at room temperature between 68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0 F (20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0 C). \u2022 Safely throw away medicine that is out of date or no longer needed. Keep icosapent ethyl and all medicine out of the reach of children. General information about the safe and effective use of icosapent ethyl.

The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. ( 5.1 ) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. ( 5.2 ) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel or warfarin. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR= 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions to icosapent ethyl and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. 5.3 Bleeding Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 patients, 482 (12%) patients receiving icosapent ethyl experienced a bleeding event compared to 404 (10%) patients receiving placebo. Serious bleeding events occurred in 111 (3%) of patients on icosapent ethyl vs. 85 (2%) of patients receiving placebo. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel or warfarin."

Common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 3% on icosapent ethyl and \u2265 1% more frequent than placebo) included musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, constipation, gout and atrial fibrillation. Hypertriglyceridemia Trials In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with triglyceride levels between 200 mg/dL and 2,000 mg/dL treated for 12 weeks, adverse reactions reported with icosapent ethyl at an incidence \u2265 1% more frequent than placebo based on pooled data included arthralgia and oropharyngeal pain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of icosapent ethyl. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3 g/kg/day, 1 g/kg/day and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3 g/kg/day, 1 g/kg/day, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7 to 17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F 1 or F 2 ). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1 g/kg/day, 0.3 g/kg/day and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea, number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3 g/kg/day, 1 g/kg/day, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for icosapent ethyl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl."

Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1 g/kg/day, 0.3 g/kg/day and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea, number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3 g/kg/day, 1 g/kg/day, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12 week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters and < 1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl have not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R- and S- warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

Hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas of the mesenteric lymph node, the site of drug absorption, were observed in females at clinically relevant exposures based on body surface area comparisons across species relative to the maximum clinical dose of 4 g/day. Overall incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in all vascular tissues did not increase with treatment. In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice with oral gavage doses of 0.5 g/kg/day, 1 g/kg/day, 2 g/kg/day and 4.6 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, drug-related incidences of benign squamous cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the tail was observed in high dose male mice. The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice. Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation. In an oral gavage rat fertility study, ethyl-EPA, administered at doses of 0.3 g/kg/day, 1 g/kg/day and 3 g/kg/day to male rats for 9 weeks before mating and to female rats for 14 days before mating through day 7 of gestation, increased anogenital distance in female pups and increased cervical ribs were observed at 3 g/kg/day (7 times human systemic exposure with 4 g/day clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison)."

Patients whose baseline TG levels were between 500 mg/dL and 2,000 mg/dL were enrolled in this study for 12 weeks. The median baseline TG and LDL-C levels in these patients were 684 mg/dL and 86 mg/dL, respectively. Median baseline HDL-C level was 27 mg/dL. The randomized population in this study was mostly Caucasian (88%) and male (76%). The mean age was 53 years and the mean body mass index was 31 kg/m 2 . Twenty-five percent of patients were on concomitant statin therapy, 28% were diabetics and 39% of the patients had TG levels > 750 mg/dL. The changes in the major lipoprotein lipid parameters for the groups receiving icosapent ethyl or placebo are shown in Table 2.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7 to 17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F 1 or F 2 ). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F 2 ) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and < 1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl has not been studied in pediatric patients.

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and < 1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl has not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R- and S-warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg.

Hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas of the mesenteric lymph node, the site of drug absorption, were observed in females at clinically relevant exposures based on body surface area comparisons across species relative to the maximum clinical dose of 4 g/day. Overall incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in all vascular tissues did not increase with treatment. In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice with oral gavage doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4.6 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, drug-related incidences of benign squamous cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the tail was observed in high dose male mice. The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice. Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation. In an oral gavage rat fertility study, ethyl-EPA, administered at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 g/kg/day to male rats for 9 weeks before mating and to female rats for 14 days before mating through day 7 of gestation, increased anogenital distance in female pups and increased cervical ribs were observed at 3 g/kg/day (7 times human systemic exposure with 4 g/day clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison)."

The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. ( 5.1 ) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl capsules contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl capsules. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl capsules and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. ( 5.2 ) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl capsules were associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl capsules are associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl capsules compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR=1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl capsules contain ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F1 or F2). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea, number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl capsules."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl capsules 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl capsules with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady-state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl have not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin: In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R- and S- warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin: In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

Hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas of the mesenteric lymph node, the site of drug absorption, were observed in females at clinically relevant exposures based on body surface area comparisons across species relative to the maximum clinical dose of 4 g/day. Overall incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in all vascular tissues did not increase with treatment. In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice with oral gavage doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4.6 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, drug-related incidences of benign squamous cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the tail was observed in high dose male mice. The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice. Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation. In an oral gavage rat fertility study, ethyl-EPA, administered at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 g/kg/day to male rats for 9 weeks before mating and to female rats for 14 days before mating through day 7 of gestation, increased anogenital distance in female pups and increased cervical ribs were observed at 3 g/kg/day (7 times human systemic exposure with 4 g/day clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison)."

In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice with oral gavage doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4.6 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, drug-related incidences of benign squamous cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the tail was observed in high dose male mice. The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice. Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation. In an oral gavage rat fertility study, ethyl-EPA, administered at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 g/kg/day to male rats for 9 weeks before mating and to female rats for 14 days before mating through day 7 of gestation, increased anogenital distance in female pups and increased cervical ribs were observed at 3 g/kg/day (7 times human systemic exposure with 4 g/day clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.2 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia The effects of icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day were assessed in a randomized, placebo- controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study of adult patients (76 on icosapent ethyl, 75 on placebo) with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Patients whose baseline TG levels were between 500 and 2,000 mg/dL were enrolled in this study for 12 weeks. The median baseline TG and LDL-C levels in these patients were 684 mg/dL and 86 mg/dL, respectively. Median baseline HDL-C level was 27 mg/dL. The randomized population in this study was mostly Caucasian (88%) and male (76%). The mean age was 53 years and the mean body mass index was 31 kg/m 2 . Twenty-five percent of patients were on concomitant statin therapy, 28% were diabetics, and 39% of the patients had TG levels >750 mg/dL. The changes in the major lipoprotein lipid parameters for the groups receiving icosapent ethyl or placebo are shown in Table 2 . Table 2.

The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. (5.1) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl capsules contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl capsules. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. (5.2) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. (5.3) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR= 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions to icosapent ethyl and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. 5.3 Bleeding Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 patients, 482 (12%) patients receiving icosapent ethyl experienced a bleeding event compared to 404 (10%) patients receiving placebo. Serious bleeding events occurred in 111 (3%) of patients on icosapent ethyl vs. 85 (2%) of patients receiving placebo.

Common adverse reactions (incidence \u22653% on icosapent ethyl and \u22651% more frequent than placebo) included musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, constipation, gout, and atrial fibrillation. Hypertriglyceridemia Trials In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with triglyceride levels between 200 and 2000 mg/dL treated for 12 weeks, adverse reactions reported with icosapent ethyl at an incidence \u22651% more frequent than placebo based on pooled data included arthralgia and oropharyngeal pain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of icosapent ethyl capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F 1 or F 2 ). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F 1 or F 2 ). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl capsules was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl capsules with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl have not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R - and S -warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study with oral gavage doses of 0.09, 0.27, and 0.91 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, respectively, males did not exhibit drug-related neoplasms. Hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas of the mesenteric lymph node, the site of drug absorption, were observed in females at clinically relevant exposures based on body surface area comparisons across species relative to the maximum clinical dose of 4 g/day. Overall incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in all vascular tissues did not increase with treatment. In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice with oral gavage doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4.6 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, drug-related incidences of benign squamous cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the tail was observed in high dose male mice. The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice. Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation. In an oral gavage rat fertility study, ethyl-EPA, administered at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 g/kg/day to male rats for 9 weeks before mating and to female rats for 14 days before mating through day 7 of gestation, increased anogenital distance in female pups and increased cervical ribs were observed at 3 g/kg/day (7 times human systemic exposure with 4 g/day clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.2 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia The effects of icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day were assessed in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study of adult patients (76 on icosapent ethyl, 75 on placebo) with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Patients whose baseline TG levels were between 500 and 2,000 mg/dL were enrolled in this study for 12 weeks. The median baseline TG and LDL-C levels in these patients were 684 mg/dL and 86 mg/dL, respectively. Median baseline HDL-C level was 27 mg/dL. The randomized population in this study was mostly Caucasian (88%) and male (76%). The mean age was 53 years and the mean body mass index was 31 kg/m 2 . Twenty-five percent of patients were on concomitant statin therapy, 28% were diabetics, and 39% of the patients had TG levels >750 mg/dL. The changes in the major lipoprotein lipid parameters for the groups receiving icosapent ethyl or placebo are shown in Table 2. Table 2.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F 1 or F 2 ). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl capsules was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl capsules with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl have not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R - and S -warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

Hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas of the mesenteric lymph node, the site of drug absorption, were observed in females at clinically relevant exposures based on body surface area comparisons across species relative to the maximum clinical dose of 4 g/day. Overall incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in all vascular tissues did not increase with treatment. In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice with oral gavage doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4.6 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, drug-related incidences of benign squamous cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the tail was observed in high dose male mice. The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice. Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation. In an oral gavage rat fertility study, ethyl-EPA, administered at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 g/kg/day to male rats for 9 weeks before mating and to female rats for 14 days before mating through day 7 of gestation, increased anogenital distance in female pups and increased cervical ribs were observed at 3 g/kg/day (7 times human systemic exposure with 4 g/day clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter : Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. ( 5.1 ) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy : Icosapent ethyl capsules contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl capsules. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. ( 5.2 ) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR= 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions to icosapent ethyl and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. 5.3 Bleeding Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo- controlled trial of 8,179 patients, 482 (12%) patients receiving icosapent ethyl experienced a bleeding event compared to 404 (10%) patients receiving placebo. Serious bleeding events occurred in 111 (3%) of patients on icosapent ethyl vs. 85 (2%) of patients receiving placebo.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7 to 17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F1 or F2). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl.",

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl capsules was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl capsules with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl have not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC\u03c4 or Cmax of omeprazole when co- administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or Cmax of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or Cmax of R- and S\u00ad warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC\u03c4 or Cmax of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state.",

Overall incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in all vascular tissues did not increase with treatment. In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice with oral gavage doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4.6 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, drug-related incidences of benign squamous cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the tail was observed in high dose male mice. The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice. Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation.

The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. ( 5.1 ) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. ( 5.2 ) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR= 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)].

Common adverse reactions (incidence \u22653% on icosapent ethyl and \u22651% more frequent than placebo) included musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, constipation, gout, and atrial fibrillation. Hypertriglyceridemia Trials In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with triglyceride levels between 200 and 2000 mg/dL treated for 12 weeks, adverse reactions reported with icosapent ethyl at an incidence \u22651% more frequent than placebo based on pooled data included arthralgia and oropharyngeal pain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of icosapent ethyl. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7 to 17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F 1 or F 2 ). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F 2 ) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl have not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when coadministered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R - and S -warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when coadministered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when coadministered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.2 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia The effects of icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day were assessed in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study of adult patients (76 on icosapent ethyl, 75 on placebo) with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Patients whose baseline TG levels were between 500 and 2,000 mg/dL were enrolled in this study for 12 weeks. The median baseline TG and LDL-C levels in these patients were 684 mg/dL and 86 mg/dL, respectively. Median baseline HDL-C level was 27 mg/dL. The randomized population in this study was mostly Caucasian (88%) and male (76%). The mean age was 53 years and the mean body mass index was 31 kg/m 2 . Twenty-five percent of patients were on concomitant statin therapy, 28% were diabetics, and 39% of the patients had TG levels >750 mg/dL. The changes in the major lipoprotein lipid parameters for the groups receiving icosapent ethyl or placebo are shown in Table 2. Table 2. Median Baseline and Percent Change from Baseline in Lipid Parameters in Patients with Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (\u2265500 mg/dL) Parameter Icosapent Ethyl 4 g/day N=76 Placebo N=75 Difference (95% Confidence Interval) Baseline % Change Baseline % Change TG (mg/dL) 680 -27 703 +10 -33 * (-47, -22) LDL-C (mg/dL) 91 -5 86 -3 -2 (-13, +8) Non-HDL-C (mg/dL) 225 -8 229 +8 -18 (-25, -11) TC (mg/dL) 254 -7 256 +8 -16 (-22, -11) HDL-C (mg/dL) 27 -4 27 0 -4 (-9, +2) VLDL-C (mg/dL) 123 -20 124 +14 -29 ** (-43, -14) Apo B (mg/dL) 121 -4 118 +4 -9 ** (-14, -3) % Change= Median Percent Change from Baseline Difference= Median of [Icosapent Ethyl % Change \u2013 Placebo % Change] (Hodges-Lehmann Estimate) p-values from Wilcoxon rank-sum test * p-value < 0.001 (primary efficacy endpoint) ** p-value < 0.05 (key secondary efficacy endpoints determined to be statistically significant according to the pre-specified multiple comparison procedure) Icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG, VLDL-C, and Apo B levels from baseline relative to placebo. The reduction in TG observed with icosapent ethyl was not associated with elevations in LDL-C levels relative to placebo."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. ( 5.1 ) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. ( 5.2 ) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR= 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F1 or F2). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl has not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin: In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R - and S -warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin: In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. ( 5.1 ) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. ( 5.2 ) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F1 or F2). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea, number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl has not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin: In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R - and S -warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin: In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl capsules contain ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl capsules. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions to icosapent ethyl capsules and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl capsules and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. 5.3 Bleeding Icosapent ethyl capsules are associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 patients, 482 (12%) patients receiving icosapent ethyl capsules experienced a bleeding event compared to 404 (10%) patients receiving placebo. Serious bleeding events occurred in 111 (3%) of patients on icosapent ethyl capsules vs. 85 (2%) of patients receiving placebo. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin."

Common adverse reactions (incidence \u22653% on icosapent ethyl capsules and \u22651% more frequent than placebo) included musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, constipation, gout, and atrial fibrillation. Hypertriglyceridemia Trials In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with triglyceride levels between 200 and 2000 mg/dL treated for 12 weeks, adverse reactions reported with icosapent ethyl capsules at an incidence \u22651% more frequent than placebo based on pooled data included arthralgia and oropharyngeal pain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of icosapent ethyl capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F1 or F2). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea, number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for icosapent ethyl capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl capsules."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl capsules 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl capsules with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady-state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl have not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone: In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin: In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R- and S- warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin: In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: Icosapent ethyl capsules were associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. (5.1) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl capsules contain ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl capsules. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl capsules and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. (5.2) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl capsules were associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. (5.3) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl capsules are associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl capsules compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR= 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl capsules contain ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl capsules. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions to icosapent ethyl capsules and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl capsules and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. 5.3 Bleeding Icosapent ethyl capsules are associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 patients, 482 (12%) patients receiving icosapent ethyl capsules experienced a bleeding event compared to 404 (10%) patients receiving placebo. Serious bleeding events occurred in 111 (3%) of patients on icosapent ethyl capsules vs. 85 (2%) of patients receiving placebo. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin."

Common adverse reactions (incidence \u22653% on icosapent ethyl capsules and \u22651% more frequent than placebo) included musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, constipation, gout, and atrial fibrillation. Hypertriglyceridemia Trials In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with triglyceride levels between 200 and 2000 mg/dL treated for 12 weeks, adverse reactions reported with icosapent ethyl capsules at an incidence \u22651% more frequent than placebo based on pooled data included arthralgia and oropharyngeal pain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of icosapent ethyl capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.3, 1 and 2 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis all drug treated groups had non-dose-related imbalances in visceral and skeletal findings, including 13 th reduced ribs, additional liver lobes, testes medially displaced and/or not descended, at human systemic exposures following a maximum oral dose of 4 g/day based on body surface comparisons. In a multigenerational developmental study in pregnant rats given doses of 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl by oral gavage from gestation day 7-17, icosapent ethyl did not affect viability in fetuses (F 1 or F 2 ). Non-dose-related imbalances in findings of absent optic nerves and unilateral testes atrophy at human exposures based on the maximum dose of 4 g/day and on body surface area comparisons. Additional variations consisting of early incisor eruption and increased percent cervical ribs were observed at the same exposures. Pups from high dose treated dams exhibited decreased copulation rates, delayed estrus, decreased implantations and decreased surviving fetuses (F2) suggesting potential multigenerational effects of icosapent ethyl at 7 times human systemic exposure following 4 g/day dose based on body surface area comparisons across species. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl from gestation through organogenesis, a decrease in body weight and food consumption was observed at the high dose of 1 g/kg/day (5 times the human exposure at the maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons). Slight increases in resorbed and dead fetuses were noted in the 1 g/kg/day group, but these were not significantly different from the control group. There were no differences between the icosapent ethyl groups and control group as to the number of corpora lutea , number of implantations, number of surviving fetuses, sex ratio, body weight of female fetuses or placental weight. There were no treatment-related malformations or skeletal anomalies. In pregnant rats given icosapent ethyl from gestation day 17 through lactation day 20 at 0.3, 1, 3 g/kg/day no adverse maternal or developmental effects were observed. However, complete litter loss (not dose-related) was noted in 2/23 litters at the low dose and 1/23 mid-dose dams by post-natal day 4 at human exposures at a maximum dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for icosapent ethyl capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from icosapent ethyl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in well-controlled clinical studies of icosapent ethyl, 45% were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger groups. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with icosapent ethyl capsules."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from published case reports and the pharmacovigilance database on the use of icosapent ethyl capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats, non-dose-related imbalances for some minor developmental findings were observed with oral administration of icosapent ethyl during organogenesis at exposures that were equivalent to the clinical exposure at the human dose of 4 g/day, based on body surface area comparisons. In a study in pregnant rabbits orally administered icosapent ethyl during organogenesis, there were no clinically relevant adverse developmental effects at exposures that were 5 times the clinical exposure, based on body surface area comparisons (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased \u03b2-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, icosapent ethyl capsules 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take icosapent ethyl capsules with or following a meal. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and <1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA. Excretion The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. Icosapent ethyl does not undergo renal excretion. Specific Populations Gender When administered icosapent ethyl in clinical trials, plasma total EPA concentrations did not differ significantly between men and women. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of icosapent ethyl have not been studied in pediatric patients. Hepatic or Renal Impairment Icosapent ethyl has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Omeprazole In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of omeprazole when co-administered at 40 mg/day to steady-state. Rosiglitazone In a drug-drug interaction study with 28 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of rosiglitazone at 8 mg. Warfarin In a drug-drug interaction study with 25 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the single dose AUC or C max of R- and S- warfarin or the anti-coagulation pharmacodynamics of warfarin when co-administered as racemic warfarin at 25 mg. Atorvastatin In a drug-drug interaction study of 26 healthy adult subjects, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day at steady-state did not significantly change the steady-state AUC \u03c4 or C max of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin when co-administered with atorvastatin 80 mg/day at steady-state."

Hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas of the mesenteric lymph node, the site of drug absorption, were observed in females at clinically relevant exposures based on body surface area comparisons across species relative to the maximum clinical dose of 4 g/day. Overall incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in all vascular tissues did not increase with treatment. In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice with oral gavage doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4.6 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, drug-related incidences of benign squamous cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the tail was observed in high dose male mice. The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice. Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation. In an oral gavage rat fertility study, ethyl-EPA, administered at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 g/kg/day to male rats for 9 weeks before mating and to female rats for 14 days before mating through day 7 of gestation, increased anogenital distance in female pups and increased cervical ribs were observed at 3 g/kg/day (7 times human systemic exposure with 4 g/day clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison)."

Patients whose baseline TG levels were between 500 and 2,000 mg/dL were enrolled in this study for 12 weeks. The median baseline TG and LDL-C levels in these patients were 684 mg/dL and 86 mg/dL, respectively. Median baseline HDL-C level was 27 mg/dL. The randomized population in this study was mostly Caucasian (88%) and male (76%). The mean age was 53 years and the mean body mass index was 31 kg/m 2 . Twenty-five percent of patients were on concomitant statin therapy, 28% were diabetics, and 39% of the patients had TG levels >750 mg/dL.
