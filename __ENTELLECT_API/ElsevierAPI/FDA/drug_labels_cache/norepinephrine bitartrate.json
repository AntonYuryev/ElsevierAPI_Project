      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. ( 2.2 ) The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique . Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one norepinephrine bitartrate injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue Ischemia : Avoid extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation : Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate injection infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine bitartrate injection may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite: Norepinephrine bitartrate injection contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of norepinephrine bitartrate to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine bitartrate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Avoid norepinephrine bitartrate in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine bitartrate elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine bitartrate injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or antidepressants of the triptyline or imipramine types may result in hypertension. ( 7.1 ) Cyclopropane and halothane anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 MAO-Inhibiting Drugs Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or other drugs with MAO-inhibiting properties (e.g., linezolid) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in patients who recently have received any of these drugs and in whom, after discontinuation, MAO activity has not yet sufficiently recovered, monitor for hypertension. 7.2 Tricyclic Antidepressants Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with tricyclic antidepressants (including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in these patients, monitor for hypertension. 7.3 Antidiabetics Norepinephrine bitartrate can decrease insulin sensitivity and raise blood glucose. Monitor glucose and consider dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drugs. 7.4 Halogenated Anesthetics Concomitant use of norepinephrine bitartrate with halogenated anesthetics (e.g., cyclopropane, desflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) may lead to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Monitor cardiac rhythm in patients receiving concomitant halogenated anesthetics."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing adverse reactions. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower ( see Data ). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis ( see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2 to 4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 to 10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of norepinephrine bitartrate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of norepinephrine bitartrate into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1-2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3- methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4- dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Administration Dilute Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection prior to use [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Infuse Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually.

To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation: Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \"normal\" blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Avoid Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower ( see Data ). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis ( see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2-4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7-10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1-2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Norepinephrine should not be given to patients who are hypotensive from blood volume deficits except as an emergency measure to maintain coronary and cerebral artery perfusion until blood volume replacement therapy can be completed. If norepinephrine bitartrate injection is continuously administered to maintain blood pressure in the absence of blood volume replacement, the following may occur: severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and urine output, poor systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure, tissue hypoxia, and lactate acidosis. Norepinephrine should also not be given to patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis (because of the risk of increasing ischemia and extending the area of infarction) unless, in the opinion of the attending physician, the administration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection is necessary as a life-saving procedure. Cyclopropane and halothane anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability and therefore seem to sensitize the myocardium to the action of intravenously administered epinephrine or norepinephrine. Hence, the use of norepinephrine during cyclopropane and halothane anesthesia is generally considered contraindicated because of the risk of producing ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. The same type of cardiac arrhythmias may result from the use of norepinephrine bitartrate injection in patients with profound hypoxia or hypercarbia."

The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Avoid Hypertension : Because of the potency of norepinephrine and because of varying response to pressor substances, the possibility always exists that dangerously high blood pressure may be produced with overdoses of this pressor agent. It is desirable, therefore, to record the blood pressure every two minutes from the time administration is started until the desired blood pressure is obtained, then every five minutes if administration is to be continued. The rate of flow must be watched constantly, and the patient should never be left unattended while receiving norepinephrine bitartrate injection. Headache may be a symptom of hypertension due to overdosage. Site of Infusion : Whenever possible, infusions of norepinephrine should be given into a large vein, particularly an antecubital vein because, when administered into this vein, the risk of necrosis of the overlying skin from prolonged vasoconstriction is apparently very slight. Some authors have indicated that the femoral vein is also an acceptable route of administration. A catheter tie-in technique should be avoided, if possible, since the obstruction to blood flow around the tubing may cause stasis and increased local concentration of the drug. Occlusive vascular diseases (for example, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, diabetic endarteritis, Buerger\u2019s disease) are more likely to occur in the lower than in the upper extremity. Therefore, one should avoid the veins of the leg in elderly patients or in those suffering from such disorders. Gangrene has been reported in a lower extremity when infusions of norepinephrine were given in an ankle vein. Extravasation : The infusion site should be checked frequently for free flow. Care should be taken to avoid extravasation of norepinephrine into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Blanching along the course of the infused vein, sometimes without obvious extravasation, has been attributed to vasa vasorum constriction with increased permeability of the vein wall, permitting some leakage. This also may progress on rare occasions to superficial slough, particularly during infusion into leg veins in elderly patients or in those suffering from obliterative vascular disease. Hence, if blanching occurs, consideration should be given to the advisability of changing the infusion site at intervals to allow the effects of local vasoconstriction to subside. IMPORTANT \u2014 Antidote for Extravasation Ischemia: To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of Regitine \u00ae (brand of phentolamine) , an adrenergic blocking agent. A syringe with a fine hypodermic needle should be used, with the solution being infiltrated liberally throughout the area, which is easily identified by its cold, hard, and pallid appearance. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. Therefore, phentolamine should be given as soon as possible after the extravasation is noted. Drug Interactions: Cyclopropane and halothane anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability and therefore seem to sensitize the myocardium to the action of intravenously administered epinephrine or norepinephrine. Hence, the use of norepinephrine during cyclopropane and halothane anesthesia is generally considered contraindicated because of the risk of producing ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. The same type of cardiac arrhythmias may result from the use of norepinephrine in patients with profound hypoxia or hypercarbia. Norepinephrine should be used with extreme caution in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or antidepressants of the triptyline or imipramine types, because severe, prolonged hypertension may result. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Studies have not been performed. Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with norepinephrine. It is also not known whether norepinephrine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Norepinephrine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when norepinephrine is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients has not been established. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of norepinephrine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Norepinephrine infusions should not be administered into the veins in the leg in elderly patients (see PRECAUTIONS , General )."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Avoid Hypertension : Because of the potency of norepinephrine and because of varying response to pressor substances, the possibility always exists that dangerously high blood pressure may be produced with overdoses of this pressor agent. It is desirable, therefore, to record the blood pressure every two minutes from the time administration is started until the desired blood pressure is obtained, then every five minutes if administration is to be continued. The rate of flow must be watched constantly, and the patient should never be left unattended while receiving norepinephrine bitartrate injection. Headache may be a symptom of hypertension due to overdosage. Site of Infusion : Whenever possible, infusions of norepinephrine should be given into a large vein, particularly an antecubital vein because, when administered into this vein, the risk of necrosis of the overlying skin from prolonged vasoconstriction is apparently very slight. Some authors have indicated that the femoral vein is also an acceptable route of administration. A catheter tie-in technique should be avoided, if possible, since the obstruction to blood flow around the tubing may cause stasis and increased local concentration of the drug. Occlusive vascular diseases (for example, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, diabetic endarteritis, Buerger\u2019s disease) are more likely to occur in the lower than in the upper extremity. Therefore, one should avoid the veins of the leg in elderly patients or in those suffering from such disorders. Gangrene has been reported in a lower extremity when infusions of norepinephrine were given in an ankle vein. Extravasation : The infusion site should be checked frequently for free flow. Care should be taken to avoid extravasation of norepinephrine into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Blanching along the course of the infused vein, sometimes without obvious extravasation, has been attributed to vasa vasorum constriction with increased permeability of the vein wall, permitting some leakage. This also may progress on rare occasions to superficial slough, particularly during infusion into leg veins in elderly patients or in those suffering from obliterative vascular disease. Hence, if blanching occurs, consideration should be given to the advisability of changing the infusion site at intervals to allow the effects of local vasoconstriction to subside. IMPORTANT \u2014 Antidote for Extravasation Ischemia: To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of Regitine \u00ae (brand of phentolamine) , an adrenergic blocking agent. A syringe with a fine hypodermic needle should be used, with the solution being infiltrated liberally throughout the area, which is easily identified by its cold, hard, and pallid appearance. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. Therefore, phentolamine should be given as soon as possible after the extravasation is noted."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following reactions can occur: Body As A Whole: Ischemic injury due to potent vasoconstrictor action and tissue hypoxia. Cardiovascular System: Bradycardia, probably as a reflex result of a rise in blood pressure, arrhythmias. Nervous System: Anxiety, transient headache. Respiratory System: Respiratory difficulty. Skin and Appendages: Extravasation necrosis at injection site. Prolonged administration of any potent vasopressor may result in plasma volume depletion which should be continuously corrected by appropriate fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy. If plasma volumes are not corrected, hypotension may recur when norepinephrine is discontinued, or blood pressure may be maintained at the risk of severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction (e.g., decreased renal perfusion) with diminution in blood flow and tissue perfusion with subsequent tissue hypoxia and lactic acidosis and possible ischemic injury. Gangrene of extremities has been rarely reported. Overdoses or conventional doses in hypersensitive persons (e.g., hyperthyroid patients) cause severe hypertension with violent headache, photophobia, stabbing retrosternal pain, pallor, intense sweating, and vomiting.

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Norepinephrine bitartrate injection is a concentrated, potent drug which must be diluted in dextrose containing solutions prior to infusion. An infusion of norepinephrine bitartrate injection should be given into a large vein ( see PRECAUTIONS ). Restoration of Blood Pressure in Acute Hypotensive States Blood volume depletion should always be corrected as fully as possible before any vasopressor is administered. When, as an emergency measure, intraaortic pressures must be maintained to prevent cerebral or coronary artery ischemia, norepinephrine bitartrate injection can be administered before and concurrently with blood volume replacement. Diluent: Norepinephrine bitartrate injection should be diluted in 5 percent dextrose injection or 5 percent dextrose and sodium chloride injections. These dextrose containing fluids are protection against significant loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately (for example, by use of a Y-tube and individual containers if given simultaneously). Average Dosage: Add the content of the vial (4 mg/4 mL) of norepinephrine bitartrate injection to 1,000 mL of a 5 percent dextrose containing solution. Each mL of this dilution contains 4 mcg of the base of norepinephrine bitartrate. Give this solution by intravenous infusion. Insert a plastic intravenous catheter through a suitable bore needle well advanced centrally into the vein and securely fixed with adhesive tape, avoiding, if possible, a catheter tie-in technique as this promotes stasis. An IV drip chamber or other suitable metering device is essential to permit an accurate estimation of the rate of flow in drops per minute. After observing the response to an initial dose of 2 mL to 3 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation to vital organs. In previously hypertensive patients, it is recommended that the blood pressure should be raised no higher than 40 mm Hg below the preexisting systolic pressure. The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.5 mL to 1 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). High Dosage: Great individual variation occurs in the dose required to attain and maintain an adequate blood pressure. In all cases, dosage of norepinephrine bitartrate injection should be titrated according to the response of the patient. Occasionally much larger or even enormous daily doses (as high as 68 mg base or 17 vials) may be necessary if the patient remains hypotensive, but occult blood volume depletion should always be suspected and corrected when present. Central venous pressure monitoring is usually helpful in detecting and treating this situation. Fluid Intake: The degree of dilution depends on clinical fluid volume requirements. If large volumes of fluid (dextrose) are needed at a flow rate that would involve an excessive dose of the pressor agent per unit of time, a solution more dilute than 4 mcg per mL should be used. On the other hand, when large volumes of fluid are clinically undesirable, a concentration greater than 4 mcg per mL may be necessary. Duration of Therapy: The infusion should be continued until adequate blood pressure and tissue perfusion are maintained without therapy. Infusions of norepinephrine bitartrate injection should be reduced gradually, avoiding abrupt withdrawal. In some of the reported cases of vascular collapse due to acute myocardial infarction, treatment was required for up to six days. Adjunctive Treatment in Cardiac Arrest Infusions of norepinephrine bitartrate injection are usually administered intravenously during cardiac resuscitation to restore and maintain an adequate blood pressure after an effective heartbeat and ventilation have been established by other means. [Norepinephrine\u2019s powerful beta-adrenergic stimulating action is also thought to increase the strength and effectiveness of systolic contractions once they occur.] Average Dosage: To maintain systemic blood pressure during the management of cardiac arrest, norepinephrine bitartrate injection is used in the same manner as described under Restoration of Blood Pressure in Acute Hypotensive States. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to use, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents."

(2.2) The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). (2.2) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )] . Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one norepinephrine bitartrate injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue Ischemia : Avoid extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. (5.1) Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation : Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate injection infusion rate gradually. (5.2) Cardiac Arrhythmias : Norepinephrine Bitartrate may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. (5.3) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite : Norepinephrine Bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. (5.4) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of norepinephrine bitartrate to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine bitartrate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Avoid norepinephrine bitartrate in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine Bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing adverse reactions. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower (see Data) . Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4% and 15 - 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2 - 4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 - 10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of norepinephrine bitartrate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of norepinephrine bitartrate into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4% and 15 - 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2 - 4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 - 10)."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Norepinephrine (sometimes referred to as l-arterenol/Levarterenol or l-norepinephrine) is a sympathomimetic amine which differs from epinephrine by the absence of a methyl group on the nitrogen atom. Norepinephrine Bitartrate is (-)-\u03b1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol tartrate (1:1) (salt) monohydrate (molecular weight 337.3 g/mol) and has the following structural formula: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection, USP is supplied in a sterile aqueous solution in the form of the bitartrate salt to be administered by intravenous infusion. Norepinephrine is sparingly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in alcohol and ether, and readily soluble in acids. Each mL contains 1 mg of norepinephrine base (equivalent to 1.89 mg of norepinephrine bitartrate, anhydrous basis), sodium chloride for isotonicity, not more than 0.2 mg (vials) of sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant. It has a pH of 3.0 to 4.5. The air in the containers has been displaced by nitrogen gas. norepinephrine-spl-structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1 - 2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4\u00ac dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. ( 2.2 ) The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Administration Dilute Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Infuse Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique . Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless) . Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue Ischemia : Avoid extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation : Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Avoid Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Norepinephrine (sometimes referred to as l-arterenol/Levarterenol or l-norepinephrine) is a sympathomimetic amine which differs from epinephrine by the absence of a methyl group on the nitrogen atom. Norepinephrine bitartrate is (-)-\u03b1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol tartrate (1:1) (salt) monohydrate (molecular weight 337.3 g/mol) and has the following structural formula: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection is supplied in a sterile aqueous solution in the form of the bitartrate salt to be administered by intravenous infusion. Norepinephrine is sparingly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in alcohol and ether, and readily soluble in acids. Each mL contains 1 mg of norepinephrine base (equivalent to 1.89 mg of norepinephrine bitartrate, anhydrous basis), sodium chloride for isotonicity, not more than 0.2 mg (vials) of sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant. It has a pH of 3.0 to 4.5. The air in the containers has been displaced by nitrogen gas. structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1-2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3\u00ad methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4\u00ad dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one norepinephrine bitartrate injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Tissue Ischemia: Avoid extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation: Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine bitartrate may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Allergic Reactions with Sulfite: Norepinephrine bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine bitartrate injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Avoid norepinephrine bitartrate injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine bitartrate injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine bitartrate injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower ( see Data ). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis ( see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15\u221220%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2-4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7-10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of norepinephrine bitartrate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1-2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. ( 2.2 ) The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one norepinephrine bitartrate injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue Ischemia: Avoid extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation : Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine bitartrate may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite: Norepinephrine bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of norepinephrine bitartrate to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine bitartrate [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Avoid norepinephrine bitartrate in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine bitartrate elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine bitartrate injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

( 7.4 ) 7.1 MAO-Inhibiting Drugs Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or other drugs with MAO-inhibiting properties (e.g., linezolid) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in patients who recently have received any of these drugs and in whom, after discontinuation, MAO activity has not yet sufficiently recovered, monitor for hypertension. 7.2 Tricyclic Antidepressants Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with tricyclic antidepressants (including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, and imipramine) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in these patients, monitor for hypertension. 7.3 Antidiabetics Norepinephrine bitartrate can decrease insulin sensitivity and raise blood glucose. Monitor glucose and consider dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drugs. 7.4 Halogenated Anesthetics Concomitant use of norepinephrine bitartrate with halogenated anesthetics (e.g., cyclopropane, desflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) may lead to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Monitor cardiac rhythm in patients receiving concomitant halogenated anesthetics."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing adverse reactions. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower (see Data). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on an mg/m3 basis for four days during organogenesis (see Data). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2 to 4 mcg/min in human, on an mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on an mg/m2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 to 10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of norepinephrine bitartrate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of norepinephrine bitartrate into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1 to 2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. (2.2) The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). (2.2) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one norepinephrine bitartrate injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue Ischemia: Avoid extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. (5.1) Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation: Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate injection infusion rate gradually. (5.2) Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine bitartrate injection may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. (5.3) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite: Norepinephrine bitartrate injection contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. (5.4) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine bitartrate injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Avoid norepinephrine bitartrate injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine bitartrate injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine bitartrate injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

(7.4) 7.1 MAO-Inhibiting Drugs Coadministration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or other drugs with MAO-inhibiting properties (e.g., linezolid) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection cannot be avoided in patients who recently have received any of these drugs and in whom, after discontinuation, MAO activity has not yet sufficiently recovered, monitor for hypertension. 7.2 Tricyclic Antidepressants Coadministration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection with tricyclic antidepressants (including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection cannot be avoided in these patients, monitor for hypertension. 7.3 Antidiabetics Norepinephrine bitartrate injection can decrease insulin sensitivity and raise blood glucose. Monitor glucose and consider dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drugs. 7.4 Halogenated Anesthetics Concomitant use of norepinephrine bitartrate injection with halogenated anesthetics (e.g., cyclopropane, desflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) may lead to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Monitor cardiac rhythm in patients receiving concomitant halogenated anesthetics."

(8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower (see Data). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m3 basis for four days during organogenesis (see Data). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2 to 4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 to 10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of norepinephrine bitartrate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1 to 2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3\u00ad methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4\u00ad dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

( 2.2 ) The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one norepinephrine bitartrate injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue Ischemia: Avoid extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation: Sudden cessation of theinfusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Avoid Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing adverse reactions. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower (see Data). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m3 basis for four days during organogenesis (see Data). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4% and 15 - 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Lifesustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2 - 4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 - 10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Norepinephrine (sometimes referred to as l-arterenol/Levarterenol or l-norepinephrine) is a sympathomimetic amine which differs from epinephrine by the absence of a methyl group on the nitrogen atom. Norepinephrine Bitartrate is (-)-\u03b1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol tartrate (1:1) (salt) monohydrate (molecular weight 337.3 g/mol) and has the following structural formula: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection, USP is supplied in a sterile aqueous solution in the form of the bitartrate salt to be administered by intravenous infusion. Norepinephrine is Freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in alcohol, practically insoluble in chloroform and ether. Each mL contains 1 mg of norepinephrine base (equivalent to 1.89 mg of norepinephrine bitartrate, anhydrous basis), sodium chloride for isotonicity, not more than 0.2 mg (vials) of sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant. It has a pH of 3.0 to 4.5. The air in the containers has been displaced by nitrogen gas. \"Image Description\""

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1- 2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4- dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower ( see Data ). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on an mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis ( see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2 to 4 mcg/min in human, on an mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on an mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 to 10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Norepinephrine (sometimes referred to as l-arterenol/Levarterenol or l-norepinephrine) is a sympathomimetic amine which differs from epinephrine by the absence of a methyl group on the nitrogen atom. Norepinephrine bitartrate, USP is (-)-\u03b1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol tartrate (1:1) (salt) monohydrate (molecular weight 337.3 g/mol) and has the following structural formula: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection, USP is supplied in a sterile aqueous solution in the form of the bitartrate salt to be administered by intravenous infusion. Norepinephrine is sparingly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in alcohol and ether, and readily soluble in acids. Each mL contains 1 mg of norepinephrine base (equivalent to 1.89 mg of norepinephrine bitartrate, anhydrous basis), sodium chloride for isotonicity, not more than 2 mg of sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant. It has a pH of 3.0 to 4.5. The air in the vials has been displaced by nitrogen gas. structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1 to 2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3\u00ad-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4\u00ad-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

( 2.2 ) \u2022 The average maintenance dose ranges from 2 to 4 mcg/min. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Administration Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection is a ready to administer product that requires no further dilution prior to infusion. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Infuse Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. The choice of appropriate concentration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection depends on clinical fluid volume requirements. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

( 5.2 ) \u2022 Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Avoid Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing adverse reactions ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower (see Data). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2-4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7-10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of norepinephrine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower (see Data). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2-4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7-10)."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection contains norepinephrine, a sympathomimetic amine. Norepinephrine is sometimes referred to as l-arterenol/Levarterenol or l-norepinephrine which differs from epinephrine by the absence of a methyl group on the nitrogen atom. Chemically, norepinephrine bitartrate monohydrate is (-)-\u03b1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol tartrate (1:1) (salt) monohydrate and has the following structural formula: Norepinephrine is sparingly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in alcohol and ether, and readily soluble in acids. Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection is supplied as a sterile aqueous solution administered by intravenous infusion. Each mL contains the equivalent of 16, 32, or 64 micrograms of norepinephrine base supplied as 31.90, 63.80, and 127.60 micrograms per mL of norepinephrine bitartrate monohydrate. It contains dextrose monohydrate (50 mg/mL) and may contain hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. It has a target pH of 3.7. The air in the containers has been displaced by nitrogen gas. Structural Formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1-2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Norepinephrine metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as the sulfate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as the glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. ( 2.2 ) The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one norepinephrine bitartrate injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue Ischemia: Avoid extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation: Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine bitartrate may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite: Norepinephrine bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine bitartrate injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Avoid norepinephrine bitartrate injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine bitartrate injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine bitartrate injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower ( see Data ). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis ( see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15\u221220%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2-4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7-10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of norepinephrine bitartrate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower ( see Data ). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis ( see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1-2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS LEVOPHED should not be given to patients who are hypotensive from blood volume deficits except as an emergency measure to maintain coronary and cerebral artery perfusion until blood volume replacement therapy can be completed. If LEVOPHED is continuously administered to maintain blood pressure in the absence of blood volume replacement, the following may occur: severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and urine output, poor systemic blood flow despite \"normal\" blood pressure, tissue hypoxia, and lactate acidosis. LEVOPHED should also not be given to patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis (because of the risk of increasing ischemia and extending the area of infarction) unless, in the opinion of the attending physician, the administration of LEVOPHED is necessary as a life-saving procedure. Cyclopropane and halothane anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability and therefore seem to sensitize the myocardium to the action of intravenously administered epinephrine or norepinephrine. Hence, the use of LEVOPHED during cyclopropane and halothane anesthesia is generally considered contraindicated because of the risk of producing ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. The same type of cardiac arrhythmias may result from the use of LEVOPHED in patients with profound hypoxia or hypercarbia."

The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Avoid Hypertension: Because of the potency of LEVOPHED and because of varying response to pressor substances, the possibility always exists that dangerously high blood pressure may be produced with overdoses of this pressor agent. It is desirable, therefore, to record the blood pressure every two minutes from the time administration is started until the desired blood pressure is obtained, then every five minutes if administration is to be continued. The rate of flow must be watched constantly, and the patient should never be left unattended while receiving LEVOPHED. Headache may be a symptom of hypertension due to overdosage. Site of Infusion: Whenever possible, infusions of LEVOPHED should be given into a large vein, particularly an antecubital vein because, when administered into this vein, the risk of necrosis of the overlying skin from prolonged vasoconstriction is apparently very slight. Some authors have indicated that the femoral vein is also an acceptable route of administration. A catheter tie-in technique should be avoided, if possible, since the obstruction to blood flow around the tubing may cause stasis and increased local concentration of the drug. Occlusive vascular diseases (for example, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, diabetic endarteritis, Buerger's disease) are more likely to occur in the lower than in the upper extremity. Therefore, one should avoid the veins of the leg in elderly patients or in those suffering from such disorders. Gangrene has been reported in a lower extremity when infusions of LEVOPHED were given in an ankle vein. Extravasation: The infusion site should be checked frequently for free flow. Care should be taken to avoid extravasation of LEVOPHED into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Blanching along the course of the infused vein, sometimes without obvious extravasation, has been attributed to vasa vasorum constriction with increased permeability of the vein wall, permitting some leakage. This also may progress on rare occasions to superficial slough, particularly during infusion into leg veins in elderly patients or in those suffering from obliterative vascular disease. Hence, if blanching occurs, consideration should be given to the advisability of changing the infusion site at intervals to allow the effects of local vasoconstriction to subside. Drug Interactions: Cyclopropane and halothane anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability and therefore seem to sensitize the myocardium to the action of intravenously administered epinephrine or norepinephrine. Hence, the use of LEVOPHED during cyclopropane and halothane anesthesia is generally considered contraindicated because of the risk of producing ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. The same type of cardiac arrhythmias may result from the use of LEVOPHED in patients with profound hypoxia or hypercarbia. LEVOPHED should be used with extreme caution in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or antidepressants of the triptyline or imipramine types, because severe, prolonged hypertension may result. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Studies have not been performed. Pregnancy: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with LEVOPHED. It is also not known whether LEVOPHED can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. LEVOPHED should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when LEVOPHED is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients has not been established. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of LEVOPHED did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. LEVOPHED infusions should not be administered into the veins in the leg in elderly patients (see PRECAUTIONS, General). PRECAUTIONS"

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following reactions can occur: Body As A Whole: Ischemic injury due to potent vasoconstrictor action and tissue hypoxia. Cardiovascular System: Bradycardia, probably as a reflex result of a rise in blood pressure, arrhythmias, and stress cardiomyopathy. Nervous System: Anxiety, transient headache. Respiratory System: Respiratory difficulty. Skin and Appendages: Extravasation necrosis at injection site. Prolonged administration of any potent vasopressor may result in plasma volume depletion which should be continuously corrected by appropriate fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy. If plasma volumes are not corrected, hypotension may recur when LEVOPHED is discontinued, or blood pressure may be maintained at the risk of severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction (e.g., decreased renal perfusion) with diminution in blood flow and tissue perfusion with subsequent tissue hypoxia and lactic acidosis and possible ischemic injury. Gangrene of extremities has been rarely reported. Overdoses or conventional doses in hypersensitive persons (e.g., hyperthyroid patients) cause severe hypertension with violent headache, photophobia, stabbing retrosternal pain, pallor, intense sweating, and vomiting."

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection is a concentrated, potent drug which must be diluted in dextrose containing solutions prior to infusion. An infusion of LEVOPHED should be given into a large vein (see PRECAUTIONS). Restoration of Blood Pressure in Acute Hypotensive States Blood volume depletion should always be corrected as fully as possible before any vasopressor is administered. When, as an emergency measure, intraaortic pressures must be maintained to prevent cerebral or coronary artery ischemia, LEVOPHED can be administered before and concurrently with blood volume replacement. Diluent: LEVOPHED should be diluted in 5 percent dextrose injection or 5 percent dextrose and sodium chloride injections. These dextrose containing fluids are protection against significant loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately (for example, by use of a Y-tube and individual containers if given simultaneously). Average Dosage: Add the content of the vial (4 mg/4 mL) of LEVOPHED to 1,000 mL of a 5 percent dextrose containing solution. Each mL of this dilution contains 4 mcg of the base of LEVOPHED. Give this solution by intravenous infusion. Insert a plastic intravenous catheter through a suitable bore needle well advanced centrally into the vein and securely fixed with adhesive tape, avoiding, if possible, a catheter tie-in technique as this promotes stasis. An IV drip chamber or other suitable metering device is essential to permit an accurate estimation of the rate of flow in drops per minute. After observing the response to an initial dose of 2 mL to 3 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation to vital organs. In previously hypertensive patients, it is recommended that the blood pressure should be raised no higher than 40 mm Hg below the preexisting systolic pressure. The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.5 mL to 1 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). High Dosage: Great individual variation occurs in the dose required to attain and maintain an adequate blood pressure. In all cases, dosage of LEVOPHED should be titrated according to the response of the patient. Occasionally much larger or even enormous daily doses (as high as 68 mg base or 17 vials) may be necessary if the patient remains hypotensive, but occult blood volume depletion should always be suspected and corrected when present. Central venous pressure monitoring is usually helpful in detecting and treating this situation. Fluid Intake: The degree of dilution depends on clinical fluid volume requirements. If large volumes of fluid (dextrose) are needed at a flow rate that would involve an excessive dose of the pressor agent per unit of time, a solution more dilute than 4 mcg per mL should be used. On the other hand, when large volumes of fluid are clinically undesirable, a concentration greater than 4 mcg per mL may be necessary. Duration of Therapy: The infusion should be continued until adequate blood pressure and tissue perfusion are maintained without therapy. Infusions of LEVOPHED should be reduced gradually, avoiding abrupt withdrawal. In some of the reported cases of vascular collapse due to acute myocardial infarction, treatment was required for up to six days. Adjunctive Treatment in Cardiac Arrest Infusions of LEVOPHED are usually administered intravenously during cardiac resuscitation to restore and maintain an adequate blood pressure after an effective heartbeat and ventilation have been established by other means. [LEVOPHED's powerful beta-adrenergic stimulating action is also thought to increase the strength and effectiveness of systolic contractions once they occur.] Average Dosage: To maintain systemic blood pressure during the management of cardiac arrest, LEVOPHED is used in the same manner as described under Restoration of Blood Pressure in Acute Hypotensive States. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to use, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique . Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless) . Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Tissue Ischemia : Avoid extravasation of norepinephrine into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse norepinephrine into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation : Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the norepinephrine infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Allergic Reactions with Sulfite: Norepinephrine contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of norepinephrine to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Avoid norepinephrine in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of norepinephrine may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the norepinephrine infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or antidepressants of the triptyline or imipramine types may result in hypertension. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Cyclopropane and halothane anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 MAO-Inhibiting Drugs Co-administration of norepinephrine with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or other drugs with MAO-inhibiting properties (e.g., linezolid) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine cannot be avoided in patients who recently have received any of these drugs and in whom, after discontinuation, MAO activity has not yet sufficiently recovered, monitor for hypertension. 7.2 Tricyclic Antidepressants Co-administration of norepinephrine with tricyclic antidepressants (including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine cannot be avoided in these patients, monitor for hypertension. 7.3 Antidiabetics Norepinephrine can decrease insulin sensitivity and raise blood glucose. Monitor glucose and consider dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drugs. 7.4 Halogenated Anesthetics Concomitant use of norepinephrine with halogenated anesthetics (e.g., cyclopropane, desflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) may lead to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Monitor cardiac rhythm in patients receiving concomitant halogenated anesthetics."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower ( see Data) . Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis ( see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2 to 4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 to 10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of norepinephrine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of norepinephrine into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1 to 2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique . Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless) . Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one norepinephrine bitartrate injection ampule (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Tissue Ischemia : Avoid extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation : Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate injection infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine bitartrate injection may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine bitartrate injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Avoid norepinephrine bitartrate injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine bitartrate injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or antidepressants of the triptyline or imipramine types may result in hypertension. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Cyclopropane and halothane anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 MAO-Inhibiting Drugs Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or other drugs with MAO-inhibiting properties (e.g., linezolid) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection cannot be avoided in patients who recently have received any of these drugs and in whom, after discontinuation, MAO activity has not yet sufficiently recovered, monitor for hypertension. 7.2 Tricyclic Antidepressants Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection with tricyclic antidepressants (including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection cannot be avoided in these patients, monitor for hypertension. 7.3 Antidiabetics Norepinephrine bitartrate injection can decrease insulin sensitivity and raise blood glucose. Monitor glucose and consider dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drugs. 7.4 Halogenated Anesthetics Concomitant use of norepinephrine bitartrate injection with halogenated anesthetics (e.g., cyclopropane, desflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) may lead to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Monitor cardiac rhythm in patients receiving concomitant halogenated anesthetics."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower ( see Data ). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis ( see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2 mcg/min to 4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 to 10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of norepinephrine bitartrate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of norepinephrine bitartrate injection into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1 minutes to 2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3- methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4- dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless to slightly yellow color solution). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one norepinephrine bitartrate injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Tissue Ischemia: Avoid extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation: Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine bitartrate may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Allergic Reactions with Sulfite: Norepinephrine bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of norepinephrine bitartrate to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine bitartrate [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Avoid norepinephrine bitartrate in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine bitartrate elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower ( see Data ). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis ( see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2 to 4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 to 10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of norepinephrine bitartrate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Norepinephrine (sometimes referred to as l-arterenol/Levarterenol or l-norepinephrine) is a sympathomimetic amine which differs from epinephrine by the absence of a methyl group on the nitrogen atom. Norepinephrine bitartrate is (-)-\u03b1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol tartrate (1:1) (salt) monohydrate (molecular weight 337.28 g/mol) and has the following structural formula: Norepinephrine bitartrate injection, USP is supplied in a sterile aqueous solution in the form of the bitartrate salt to be administered by intravenous infusion. Norepinephrine is freely soluble in purified water, slightly soluble in alcohol, practically insoluble in chloroform and ether. Each mL contains 1 mg of norepinephrine base (equivalent to 1.89 mg of norepinephrine bitartrate USP, anhydrous basis), sodium chloride for isotonicity, not more than 0.2 mg of sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant. It has a pH of 3.0 to 4.5. The air in the containers has been displaced by nitrogen gas. norepinephrinestructure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1 to 2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3- methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4- dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

( 2.2 ) The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Administration Dilute Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Infuse Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents.

( 5.3 ) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Avoid Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower ( see Data) . Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis ( see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15\u221220%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2-4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7-10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1-2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. (2.2) The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). (2.2) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one norepinephrine bitartrate injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue Ischemia: Avoid extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. (5.1) Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation: Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate injection infusion rate gradually. (5.2) Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine Bitartrate may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. (5.3) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite: Norepinephrine Bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. (5.4) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of norepinephrine bitartrate to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine bitartrate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Avoid norepinephrine bitartrate in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine Bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or antidepressants of the triptyline or imipramine types may result in hypertension. (7.1) Cyclopropane and halothane anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability. (7.4) 7.1 MAO-Inhibiting Drugs Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or other drugs with MAO-inhibiting properties (e.g., linezolid) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in patients who recently have received any of these drugs and in whom, after discontinuation, MAO activity has not yet sufficiently recovered, monitor for hypertension. 7.2 Tricyclic Antidepressants Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with tricyclic antidepressants (including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in these patients, monitor for hypertension. 7.3 Antidiabetics Norepinephrine Bitartrate can decrease insulin sensitivity and raise blood glucose. Monitor glucose and consider dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drugs. 7.4 Halogenated Anesthetics Concomitant use of norepinephrine bitartrate with halogenated anesthetics (e.g., cyclopropane, desflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) may lead to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Monitor cardiac rhythm in patients receiving concomitant halogenated anesthetics."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing adverse reactions. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower (see Data). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis (see Data). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4% and 15 - 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2 - 4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 - 10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of norepinephrine bitartrate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of norepinephrine bitartrate into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Norepinephrine (sometimes referred to as l-arterenol/Levarterenol or l-norepinephrine) is a sympathomimetic amine which differs from epinephrine by the absence of a methyl group on the nitrogen atom. Norepinephrine Bitartrate is (-)-\u03b1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol tartrate (1:1) (salt) monohydrate (molecular weight 337.3 g/mol) and has the following structural formula: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection, USP is supplied in a sterile aqueous solution in the form of the bitartrate salt to be administered by intravenous infusion. Norepinephrine is sparingly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in alcohol and ether, and readily soluble in acids. Each mL contains 1 mg of norepinephrine base (equivalent to 1.89 mg of norepinephrine bitartrate, anhydrous basis), sodium chloride for isotonicity, not more than 0.2 mg (vials) of sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant. It has a pH of 3.0 to 4.5. The air in the containers has been displaced by nitrogen gas. structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1 - 2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4 dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Administration Dilute Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection prior to use [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3)]. Infuse Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents.

Address hypovolemia prior to initiating Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1)]. Avoid Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1)]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. (see CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS below). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower (see DATA below). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m3 basis for four days during organogenesis (see DATA below). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15\u221220%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2-4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7-10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Norepinephrine (sometimes referred to as l-arterenol/Levarterenol or l-norepinephrine) is a sympathomimetic amine which differs from epinephrine by the absence of a methyl group on the nitrogen atom. Norepinephrine bitartrate is (-)-\u03b1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol tartrate (1:1) (salt) monohydrate (molecular weight 337.3 g/mol) and has the following structural formula: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection is supplied in a sterile aqueous solution in the form of the bitartrate salt to be administered by intravenous infusion. Norepinephrine is sparingly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in alcohol and ether, and readily soluble in acids. Each mL contains 1 mg of norepinephrine base (equivalent to 1.89 mg of norepinephrine bitartrate, anhydrous basis), sodium chloride for isotonicity, not more than 0.2 mg (vials) of sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant. It has a pH of 3.0 to 4.5. The air in the containers has been displaced by nitrogen gas. STRUCTURE"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1-2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3\u00ad methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4\u00ad dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. ( 2.2 ) The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one norepinephrine bitartrate injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue Ischemia : Avoid extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation : Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) Cardiac Arrhythmias : Norepinephrine Bitartrate may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite : Norepinephrine Bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of norepinephrine bitartrate to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine bitartrate [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Avoid norepinephrine bitartrate in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1 to 2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique . Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless) . Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Tissue Ischemia : Avoid extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation : Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine bitartrate may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Allergic Reactions with Sulfite: Norepinephrine bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of norepinephrine bitartrate to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine bitartrate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Avoid norepinephrine bitartrate in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine bitartrate elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

( 7.4 ) 7.1 MAO-Inhibiting Drugs Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or other drugs with MAO-inhibiting properties (e.g., linezolid) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in patients who recently have received any of these drugs and in whom, after discontinuation, MAO activity has not yet sufficiently recovered, monitor for hypertension. 7.2 Tricyclic Antidepressants Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with tricyclic antidepressants (including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in these patients, monitor for hypertension. 7.3 Antidiabetics Norepinephrine bitartrate can decrease insulin sensitivity and raise blood glucose. Monitor glucose and consider dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drugs. 7.4 Halogenated Anesthetics Concomitant use of norepinephrine bitartrate with halogenated anesthetics (e.g., cyclopropane, desflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) may lead to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower ( see Data ) . Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis ( see Data ) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2 to 4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 to 10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of norepinephrine bitartrate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1 to 2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. ( 2.2 ) The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one norepinephrine bitartrate injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue Ischemia : Avoid extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation : Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) Cardiac Arrhythmias : Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite : Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Avoid Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower (see Data ). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis (see Data ) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2 to 4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 to 10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

Norepinephrine Bitartrate is (-)-\u03b1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol tartrate (1:1) (salt) monohydrate (molecular weight 337.3 g/mol) and has the following structural formula: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection, USP is supplied in a sterile aqueous solution in the form of the bitartrate salt to be administered by intravenous infusion. Norepinephrine is freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in alcohol, practically insoluble in chloroform and ether. Each mL contains 1 mg of norepinephrine base (equivalent to 1.89 mg of norepinephrine bitartrate, anhydrous basis), sodium chloride for isotonicity, not more than 0.2 mg (vials) of sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant. It has a pH of 3.0 to 4.5. The air in the containers has been displaced by nitrogen gas. Figure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1 to 2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 minutes. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 minutes. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 minutes. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Tissue Ischemia : Avoid extravasation into tissues, which can cause local necrosis. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation : Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Sodium Chloride Injection infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Sodium Chloride Injection may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Sodium Chloride Injection to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \"normal\" blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Sodium Chloride Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Avoid Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Sodium Chloride Injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Sodium Chloride Injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Sodium Chloride Injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower ( see Data ). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis ( see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2\u20134% and 15\u201320%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2\u20134 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7\u201310). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Sodium Chloride Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1\u20132 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. ( 2.2 ) The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique . Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless) . Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one norepinephrine bitartrate injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue Ischemia : Avoid extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation : Sudden cessation of theinfusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) Cardiac Arrhythmias : Norepinephrine Bitartrate may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite : Norepinephrine Bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of norepinephrine bitartrate to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine bitartrate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Avoid norepinephrine bitartrate in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

( 7.4 ) 7.1 MAO-Inhibiting Drugs Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or other drugs with MAO-inhibiting properties (e.g., linezolid) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in patients who recently have received any of these drugs and in whom, after discontinuation, MAO activity has not yet sufficiently recovered, monitor for hypertension. 7.2 Tricyclic Antidepressants Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with tricyclic antidepressants (including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in these patients, monitor for hypertension. 7.3 Antidiabetics Norepinephrine Bitartrate can decrease insulin sensitivity and raise blood glucose. Monitor glucose and consider dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drugs. 7.4 Halogenated Anesthetics Concomitant use of norepinephrine bitartrate with halogenated anesthetics (e.g., cyclopropane, desflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) may lead to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Monitor cardiac rhythm in patients receiving concomitant halogenated anesthetics."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower (see Data). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis (see Data). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15\u221220%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2-4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7-10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of norepinephrine bitartrate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of norepinephrine bitartrate into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Norepinephrine (sometimes referred to as l-arterenol/Levarterenol or l-norepinephrine) is a sympathomimetic amine which differs from epinephrine by the absence of a methyl group on the nitrogen atom. Norepinephrine Bitartrate is (-)-\u03b1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol tartrate (1:1) (salt) monohydrate (molecular weight 337.3 g/mol) and has the following structural formula: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection, USP is supplied in a sterile aqueous solution in the form of the bitartrate salt to be administered by intravenous infusion. Norepinephrine is sparingly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in alcohol and ether, and readily soluble in acids. Each mL contains 1 mg of norepinephrine base (equivalent to 1.89 mg of norepinephrine bitartrate, anhydrous basis), sodium chloride for isotonicity, not more than 0.2 mg of sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant. It has a pH of 3.0 to 4.5. The air in the containers has been displaced by nitrogen gas. SPL-Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1-2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. ( 2.2 ) The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Administration Dilute Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Infuse Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue Ischemia : Avoid extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation : Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Avoid Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. ( see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower ( see Data) . Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis ( see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15\u221220%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2-4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7-10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1-2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. (2.2 ) \u2022 The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique . Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless) . Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one norepinephrine bitartrate injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Tissue Ischemia: Avoid extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation: Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate gradually. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine Bitartrate may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Allergic Reactions with Sulfite: Norepinephrine Bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of norepinephrine bitartrate to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine bitartrate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Avoid norepinephrine bitartrate in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

( 7.4 ) 7.1 MAO-Inhibiting Drugs Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or other drugs with MAO-inhibiting properties (e.g., linezolid) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in patients who recently have received any of these drugs and in whom, after discontinuation, MAO activity has not yet sufficiently recovered, monitor for hypertension. 7.2 Tricyclic Antidepressants Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with tricyclic antidepressants (including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in these patients, monitor for hypertension. 7.3 Antidiabetics Norepinephrine Bitartrate can decrease insulin sensitivity and raise blood glucose. Monitor glucose and consider dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drugs. 7.4 Halogenated Anesthetics Concomitant use of norepinephrine bitartrate with halogenated anesthetics (e.g., cyclopropane, desflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) may lead to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Monitor cardiac rhythm in patients receiving concomitant halogenated anesthetics."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower (see Data ). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis (see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2 to 4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 to 10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of norepinephrine bitartrate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of norepinephrine bitartrate into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Norepinephrine (sometimes referred to as l-arterenol/Levarterenol or l-norepinephrine) is a sympathomimetic amine which differs from epinephrine by the absence of a methyl group on the nitrogen atom. Norepinephrine Bitartrate is (-)-\u03b1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol tartrate (1:1) (salt) monohydrate (molecular weight 337.3 g/mol) and has the following structural formula: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection, USP is supplied in a sterile aqueous solution in the form of the bitartrate salt to be administered by intravenous infusion. Norepinephrine is sparingly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in alcohol and ether, and readily soluble in acids. Each mL contains 1 mg of norepinephrine base (equivalent to 1.89 mg of norepinephrine bitartrate, anhydrous basis), sodium chloride for isotonicity, not more than 0.2 mg (vials) of sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant. It has a pH of 3.0 to 4.5. The air in the containers has been displaced by nitrogen gas. Norepinephrine Structural Formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1-2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. (2.2) The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). (2.2) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Administration Dilute Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Infuse Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )] . Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection vial to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue Ischemia : Avoid extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. (5.1) Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation : Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection infusion rate gradually. (5.2) Cardiac Arrhythmias : Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. (5.3) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite : Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. (5.4) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Avoid Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

(8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower (see Data) . Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2-4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7-10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1-2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4\u00ac dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial dose of 0.25 mL to 0.375 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low to normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation of vital organs. (2.2) The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.0625 mL to 0.125 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). (2.2) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia Address hypovolemia before initiation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection therapy. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Administration Dilute norepinephrine bitartrate injection prior to use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. Avoid infusions into the veins of the leg in the elderly or in patients with occlusive vascular disease of the legs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )] . Avoid using a catheter-tie-in technique. Discontinuation When discontinuing the infusion, reduce the flow rate gradually. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 2.2 Dosage After an initial dosage of 8 to 12 mcg per minute via intravenous infusion, assess patient response and adjust dosage to maintain desired hemodynamic effect. Monitor blood pressure every two minutes until the desired hemodynamic effect is achieved, and then monitor blood pressure every five minutes for the duration of the infusion. Typical maintenance intravenous dosage is 2 to 4 mcg per minute. 2.3 Preparation of Diluted Solution Visually inspect norepinephrine bitartrate injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is colorless). Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Add the content of one norepinephrine bitartrate injection vial (4 mg in 4 mL) to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection solutions that contain 5% dextrose to produce a 4 mcg per mL dilution. Dextrose reduces loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not recommended. Use higher concentration solutions in patients requiring fluid restriction. Prior to use, store the diluted norepinephrine bitartrate injection solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] and protect from light. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue Ischemia : Avoid extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate injection into the tissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Infuse norepinephrine bitartrate injection into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of an adrenergic blocking agent. (5.1) Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation : Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate injection infusion rate gradually. (5.2) Cardiac Arrhythmias : Norepinephrine Bitartrate may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. (5.3) Allergic Reactions with Sulfite : Norepinephrine Bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite. Sulfite may cause allergic-type-reactions. (5.4) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of norepinephrine bitartrate to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine bitartrate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Avoid norepinephrine bitartrate in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Norepinephrine Bitartrate contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or antidepressants of the triptyline or imipramine types may result in hypertension. (7.1) Cyclopropane and halothane anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability. (7.4) 7.1 MAO-Inhibiting Drugs Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or other drugs with MAO-inhibiting properties (e.g., linezolid) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in patients who recently have received any of these drugs and in whom, after discontinuation, MAO activity has not yet sufficiently recovered, monitor for hypertension. 7.2 Tricyclic Antidepressants Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with tricyclic antidepressants (including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in these patients, monitor for hypertension. 7.3 Antidiabetics Norepinephrine Bitartrate can decrease insulin sensitivity and raise blood glucose. Monitor glucose and consider dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drugs. 7.4 Halogenated Anesthetics Concomitant use of norepinephrine bitartrate with halogenated anesthetics (e.g., cyclopropane, desflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) may lead to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Monitor cardiac rhythm in patients receiving concomitant halogenated anesthetics."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing adverse reactions. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower (see Data) . Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 3 basis for four days during organogenesis (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4% and 15 - 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Data Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2 - 4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed. Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 - 10). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of norepinephrine in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinically relevant exposure to the infant is not expected based on the short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of norepinephrine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of norepinephrine bitartrate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Avoid administration of norepinephrine bitartrate into the veins in the leg in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Norepinephrine (sometimes referred to as l-arterenol/Levarterenol or l-norepinephrine) is a sympathomimetic amine which differs from epinephrine by the absence of a methyl group on the nitrogen atom. Norepinephrine Bitartrate is (-)-\u03b1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol tartrate (1:1) (salt) monohydrate (molecular weight 337.3 g/mol) and has the following structural formula: Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection, USP is supplied in a sterile aqueous solution in the form of the bitartrate salt to be administered by intravenous infusion. Norepinephrine is sparingly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in alcohol and ether, and readily soluble in acids. Each mL contains 1 mg of norepinephrine base (equivalent to 1.89 mg of norepinephrine bitartrate, anhydrous basis), sodium chloride for isotonicity, not more than 0.2 mg (vials) of sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant. It has a pH of 3.0 to 4.5. The air in the containers has been displaced by nitrogen gas. norepinephrine-spl-structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Norepinephrine is a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The primary pharmacodynamic effects of norepinephrine are cardiac stimulation and vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1 - 2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min. Metabolism Norepinephrine is metabolized in the liver and other tissues by a combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. The major metabolites are normetanephrine and 3-methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA), both of which are inactive. Other inactive metabolites include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and 3,4\u00ac dihydroxyphenylglycol. Excretion Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in urine primarily as sulphate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates. Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged."
