      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryo-Fetal Toxicity. Do not use in pregnant women. Obtain a urine or serum pregnancy test prior to initiation of therapy. Advise use of effective contraception in females of reproductive potential ( Boxed Warning , 5.1 , 8.1 , 8.8 , 13.1 ). Reproductive effects. Miltefosine caused testicular atrophy and impaired fertility in male rats and impaired fertility in female rats. Advise patients of reproductive toxicities in animal studies and that the potential effects on human fertility have not been adequately evaluated ( 13.1 ). Renal Effects. Monitor serum creatinine during therapy and for 4 weeks after end of therapy ( 5.3 , 6.1 ). Hepatic Effects. Monitor transaminases and bilirubin during therapy ( 5.4 , 6.1 ). Gastrointestinal Effects. Encourage fluid intake ( 5.5 ). Thrombocytopenia. Monitor platelet count during therapy for visceral leishmaniasis ( 5.6 , 6.1 ). Absorption of Oral Contraceptives. Advise use of alternative method of contraception if vomiting and/or diarrhea occur ( 5.7 ). Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Discontinue IMPAVIDO ( 5.8 ). 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Miltefosine may cause fetal harm. Embryo-fetal toxicity, including death and teratogenicity, was observed in animals administered miltefosine prior to mating, during early pregnancy, and during organogenesis at doses lower than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Do not use IMPAVIDO in pregnant women. Obtain a urine or serum pregnancy test prior to prescribing IMPAVIDO to females of reproductive potential. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IMPAVIDO therapy and for 5 months after completion of therapy [see Boxed Warning , Contraindications ( 4.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.8 )] . 5.2 Reproductive Effects Females Miltefosine caused impaired fertility in rats and reversible follicular atresia and diestrus in dogs at doses approximately 1.0 and 0.2 times respectively the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Effects on human female fertility have not been formally studied. Males Miltefosine caused reduced viable sperm counts and impaired fertility in rats at doses approximately 0.4 times the MRHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ] . A higher dose in rats, approximately 1.0 times the MRHD, caused testicular atrophy and impaired fertility that did not fully reverse 10 weeks after drug administration ended. Scrotal pain and decreased or absent ejaculation during therapy have been reported during IMPAVIDO therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . The effects of IMPAVIDO on human male fertility have not been adequately studied. Advise women and men of the animal fertility findings, and that the potential for impaired fertility with IMPAVIDO therapy in humans has not been adequately evaluated. 5.3 Renal Effects Elevations of serum creatinine (Cr) were noted in clinical trials evaluating IMPAVIDO in the treatment of cutaneous, mucosal and visceral leishmaniasis. Monitor renal function weekly in patients receiving IMPAVIDO during therapy and for 4 weeks after end of therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.4 Hepatic Effects Elevations in liver transaminases (ALT, AST) and bilirubin were noted in clinical trials evaluating IMPAVIDO in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. Monitor liver transaminases (ALT, AST) and bilirubin during therapy in patients receiving IMPAVIDO [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.5 Gastrointestinal Effects Vomiting and/or diarrhea commonly occur during IMPAVIDO administration and may result in volume depletion. Encourage fluid intake to avoid volume depletion [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.6 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia during therapy has been reported in patients treated for visceral leishmaniasis. Monitor platelet count during therapy for visceral leishmaniasis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . 5.7 Absorption of Oral Contraceptives Vomiting and/or diarrhea occurring during IMPAVIDO therapy may affect the absorption of oral contraceptives, and therefore compromise their efficacy. If vomiting and/or diarrhea occur during IMPAVIDO therapy, advise females to use additional non-hormonal or alternative method(s) of effective contraception. 5.8 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been reported during IMPAVIDO therapy. Discontinue IMPAVIDO if an exfoliative or bullous rash is noted during therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions occurring in \u22652% of patients include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, decreased appetite, dizziness, abdominal pain, pruritus, somnolence, elevated transaminases, and elevated creatinine (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Profounda, Inc. at 1-866-588-5405 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Visceral Leishmaniasis One Phase 3 trial was conducted in patients \u2265 12 years of age in India. Two-hundred and ninety-nine (299) patients (211 men and 88 women) received oral IMPAVIDO at a target dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days (50 mg capsule once daily if weight was less than 25 kg and 50 mg capsule twice daily if weight was 25 kg or greater). Patients ranged between 12 and 64 years of age. Weight ranged between 15 and 67 kg (mean weight 38.6 kg) and BMI ranged between 8.2 and 24 (mean 16.1). Ninety-nine (99) patients received 1 mg/kg/day amphotericin B deoxycholate intravenously every other day for 15 doses. A statistically significant higher percentage of men received IMPAVIDO compared to amphotericin B. Less than 1% of patients who received IMPAVIDO died (2/299) and no patient who received amphotericin B died. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 2% of IMPAVIDO recipients (6/299) and 1% of amphotericin B recipients (1/99). Approximately 3% of patients discontinued treatment in each treatment arm due to an adverse reaction. Serious adverse reactions and adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation that were thought to be related or possibly related to IMPAVIDO included Stevens-Johnson syndrome, melena and thrombocytopenia, arthritis and skin rash, CTCAE Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 4 diarrhea (\u226510 stools per day) and CTCAE Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia (\u226510x upper limit of normal ULN).

Ten percent of subjects in each arm had Cr elevations \u22651.5 times above baseline at 6 months follow up. No IMPAVIDO recipient discontinued therapy due to Cr elevation. Elevations of transaminases during therapy occurred in up to half of IMPAVIDO recipients and up to a third of amphotericin B recipients. The elevations were mild (< 3x ULN) or moderate (3-5x ULN) in 94% and 6% respectively of IMPAVIDO-treated patients who experienced an elevation. No patient discontinued therapy due to elevations in transaminases. At the end of therapy, 62% and 2.4% of IMPAVIDO recipients and 54% and 2% of amphotericin B recipients had platelet count < 150,000 and < 50,000 respectively. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis The efficacy of IMPAVIDO in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis was evaluated in one placebo-controlled trial conducted in Colombia and Guatemala and in two comparative trials conducted in Bolivia and Brazil respectively. In the placebo-controlled trial, eighty-nine (89) patients \u226512 years of age received a target IMPAVIDO dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days and forty-four (44) received placebo. In the comparative trials, one hundred and twenty (120) patients \u226512 years of age received a target IMPAVIDO dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days and fifty eight (58) patients received 20 mg/kg/day pentavalent antimony (meglumine) parenterally for 20 days.

In the comparative trial, a similar percentage of subjects who received IMPAVIDO or pentavalent antimony had Cr elevations above baseline at 3 and 6 months after therapy (approximately 5%). Approximately 25% of IMPAVIDO subjects and 11% of pentavalent antimony subjects had Cr elevations 1.5-3 times above baseline at the end of therapy in the two active controlled trials. The frequency of AST and ALT increase above upper limit of normal at end of therapy was similar in IMPAVIDO and placebo recipients (approximately 5%). Other adverse events seen at <2% incidence in the IMPAVIDO group included anemia, lymphadenopathy, abdominal distension, constipation, dysphagia, flatulence, fatigue, malaise, abscess, cellulitis, ecthyma, paresthesia, testicular pain, testicular swelling, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, urticaria, rash, pyoderma. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during use of IMPAVIDO worldwide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatics Disorders : thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis Gastrointestinal Disorders : melena General Disorders : generalized edema, peripheral edema Hepatobiliary Disorders : jaundice Nervous System Disorders : seizure Reproductive System and Breast Disorders : scrotal pain, decreased ejaculate volume, absent ejaculation.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: IMPAVIDO should not be used during pregnancy. Obtain a urine or serum pregnancy test in females of reproductive potential prior to prescribing ( 4.1 , 5.1 , 8.1 , 8.8 , 13.1 ). Nursing Mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing depending on importance of drug to mother. Avoid breastfeeding for 5 months after IMPAVIDO therapy ( 8.3 ). Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise females to use effective contraception during therapy and for 5 months after therapy. Advise patients of reproductive toxicities in animals, and that the potential for impaired fertility in humans has not been adequately evaluated ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 8.8 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Risk Summary IMPAVIDO may cause fetal harm. Human pregnancy data are not available, however, embryo-fetal toxicity including death and teratogenicity, was observed in embryo-fetal studies in rats and rabbits administered oral miltefosine during organogenesis at doses that were respectively 0.06 and 0.2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), based on body surface area (BSA) comparison. Numerous visceral and skeletal fetal malformations were observed in a fertility study in female rats administered miltefosine prior to mating through day 7 of pregnancy at doses 0.3 times the MRHD. Do not administer IMPAVIDO to pregnant women. Clinical Considerations During pregnancy, visceral leishmaniasis may be life-threatening for the mother and may result in adverse fetal outcomes, including spontaneous abortion, congenital disease due to vertical transmission, small for gestational age newborn, and severe anemia. During pregnancy, cutaneous leishmaniasis may manifest with larger and atypical appearing lesions and may be associated with increased risk for adverse fetal outcomes, including preterm births and stillbirths. Animal Data Miltefosine administration in rat embryo-fetal toxicity studies during early embryonic development (Day 6 to Day 15 of gestation) caused embryo-fetal toxicity including death and teratogenicity at dosages of \u2265 1.2 mg/kg/day (0.06 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). Teratogenic effects included undeveloped cerebrum, hemorrhagic fluid filling the lumina of the skull, cleft palate and generalized edema. Embryo-fetal toxicity was also observed in rabbits after oral administration of miltefosine during organogenesis (Day 6 to Day 18 of gestation) at doses \u2265 2.4 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). In both rats and rabbits, there were no viable litters at miltefosine doses \u2265 6.0 mg/kg/day (0.3 or 0.6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons for rats and rabbits respectively). In a separate female fertility study in rats, miltefosine doses \u2265 6.81 mg/kg/day (0.3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) administered for four weeks before mating and up to Day 7 of pregnancy produced numerous visceral (misshapen cerebral structures, dilated ventricles filled with brown masses, misshapen spinal cord, misshapen and malpositioned eyes, hypophysis, and absent inner ear) and skeletal (cleft palate, dumbbell-shaped ossification of thoracic vertebral centers, markedly enlarged skull bones, and markedly dilated suturae) fetal malformations. [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether IMPAVIDO is present in human milk. Because many drugs are present in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from IMPAVIDO, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Breastfeeding should be avoided for 5 months after IMPAVIDO therapy. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients < 12 years have not been established. Juvenile rats were more sensitive to the miltefosine-induced effects, especially retinal and kidney effects, than adult rats [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of IMPAVIDO did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and over to determine if they respond differently than younger subjects. 8.6 Renal Impairment Patients with serum creatinine or BUN levels \u22651.5 times the upper limit of normal were excluded from the clinical studies.

Miltefosine pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.8 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception IMPAVIDO may cause fetal harm when used during pregnancy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IMPAVIDO therapy and for 5 months after therapy is completed [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Vomiting and/or diarrhea occurring during IMPAVIDO therapy may affect absorption of oral contraceptives and therefore may compromise their efficacy. Advise females who use oral contraceptives to use additional non-hormonal or alternative method(s) of effective contraception during IMPAVIDO therapy if vomiting and/or diarrhea occurs during therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Infertility Females Miltefosine caused impaired fertility in rats and caused reversible follicular atresia and diestrus in dogs at doses approximately 1.0 and 0.2 times respectively the MRHD [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . The effects of IMPAVIDO on human female fertility have not been formally studied. Males Miltefosine caused reduced viable sperm counts and impaired fertility in rats at doses approximately 0.4 times the MRHD [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . A higher dose in rats, approximately 1.0 times the MRHD, caused testicular atrophy and impaired fertility that did not fully reverse 10 weeks after drug administration ended. The effects of IMPAVIDO on human male fertility have not been adequately studied. Advise women and men of the animal fertility findings, and that the potential for impaired fertility with IMPAVIDO therapy has not been adequately evaluated."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Risk Summary IMPAVIDO may cause fetal harm. Human pregnancy data are not available, however, embryo-fetal toxicity including death and teratogenicity, was observed in embryo-fetal studies in rats and rabbits administered oral miltefosine during organogenesis at doses that were respectively 0.06 and 0.2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), based on body surface area (BSA) comparison. Numerous visceral and skeletal fetal malformations were observed in a fertility study in female rats administered miltefosine prior to mating through day 7 of pregnancy at doses 0.3 times the MRHD. Do not administer IMPAVIDO to pregnant women. Clinical Considerations During pregnancy, visceral leishmaniasis may be life-threatening for the mother and may result in adverse fetal outcomes, including spontaneous abortion, congenital disease due to vertical transmission, small for gestational age newborn, and severe anemia. During pregnancy, cutaneous leishmaniasis may manifest with larger and atypical appearing lesions and may be associated with increased risk for adverse fetal outcomes, including preterm births and stillbirths. Animal Data Miltefosine administration in rat embryo-fetal toxicity studies during early embryonic development (Day 6 to Day 15 of gestation) caused embryo-fetal toxicity including death and teratogenicity at dosages of \u2265 1.2 mg/kg/day (0.06 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). Teratogenic effects included undeveloped cerebrum, hemorrhagic fluid filling the lumina of the skull, cleft palate and generalized edema. Embryo-fetal toxicity was also observed in rabbits after oral administration of miltefosine during organogenesis (Day 6 to Day 18 of gestation) at doses \u2265 2.4 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). In both rats and rabbits, there were no viable litters at miltefosine doses \u2265 6.0 mg/kg/day (0.3 or 0.6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons for rats and rabbits respectively). In a separate female fertility study in rats, miltefosine doses \u2265 6.81 mg/kg/day (0.3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) administered for four weeks before mating and up to Day 7 of pregnancy produced numerous visceral (misshapen cerebral structures, dilated ventricles filled with brown masses, misshapen spinal cord, misshapen and malpositioned eyes, hypophysis, and absent inner ear) and skeletal (cleft palate, dumbbell-shaped ossification of thoracic vertebral centers, markedly enlarged skull bones, and markedly dilated suturae) fetal malformations.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Miltefosine is an anti-leishmanial agent [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic parameters of miltefosine in patients with visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis treated for 28 days with IMPAVIDO are listed in Table 5. Due to the long half-life of miltefosine (> 6 days), trough plasma concentrations did not appear to reach a steady state at the end of treatment (i.e., Day 28). Table 5: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Miltefosine Following Oral Capsule Administration to Adult Patients with Visceral and Cutaneous Leishmaniasis a: Adolescent (\u226512 years)/Adults, mean dose per kg was 3.1 mg/kg/day b: Adolescent (\u226512 years)/Adults, mean dose per kg was 3.6 mg/kg/day c: Adults, mean dose per kg was 1.8 mg/kg/day d: median (range) e: AUC 0-12h for BID, AUC 0-8h for TID f: t 1/2, \u03b1 = distribution phase half-life; t 1/2,\u03b2 = terminal elimination phase half-life g: Estimates based on a population PK model h: mean (% standard error) Dose C max (\u00b5g/mL) T max d (hr) AUC tau e (\u00b5g\u2219hr/mL) t 1/2,\u03b1 f (day) t 1/2,\u03b2 g (day) Visceral Leishmaniasis (on Day 23) 50 mg BID (4 wks) a 66.2 (28.5) 7(2-12) 636 (26.7) 6.4 (31.1) 50 mg BID (1 wk)/ 50 mg TID (3 wks) b 75.9 (17.6) 4 (2-8) 486 (18.1) 8.5 (28.9) Cutaneous Leishmaniasis c (on Day 27) 50 mg TID (4 wks) 37.3 (22) f 295 (22) f 6.8 (5.8) g,h 30.7 (18.3) g,h Absorption Absolute bioavailability of miltefosine has not been determined. In patients with visceral leishmaniasis, maximum miltefosine concentrations following oral administration of IMPAVIDO capsules were reached right before the next dose in many patients, indicating that the absorption of miltefosine may proceed throughout the dosing interval. Distribution The distribution of miltefosine has not been studied in humans. Human plasma protein binding of miltefosine, evaluated by an ultracentrifugation method, was 98% over the drug concentration range from 0.1 to 10 \u00b5g/mL. In rats, radioactivity of [ 14 C] miltefosine is widely distributed after both single and repeated oral administration with highest uptake of radioactivity in kidney, liver, and spleen. Placental transfer and excretion into milk have not been investigated. Metabolism and Excretion No in vitro oxidative metabolism by 15 different human cytochrome P450 enzymes (1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, 3A5, 3A7, and 4A1) was observed. A slow metabolic breakdown could be shown in human hepatocytes, resulting in the release of choline by phospholipase D-like cleavage of the miltefosine molecule. The fatty alcohol-containing fragment of miltefosine can enter the metabolism of fatty acids after being oxidized to palmitic acid. This oxidation is blocked in patients with Sj\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome, which is caused by a genetic defect in fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. IMPAVIDO is contraindicated in patients who have Sj\u00f6gren-Larsson-Syndrome [see Contraindications ( 4.2 )] . There was little or no evidence of time or metabolism dependent inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzymes examined at up to approximately 40 \u00b5g/mL miltefosine. Oral administration of miltefosine did not markedly induce the content of hepatic CYP3A assayed by demethylation activity of erythromycin in rats. In visceral leishmaniasis patients, <0.2% of the administered dose was excreted into the urine. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The specific mode of action of miltefosine against Leishmania species is unknown. The mechanism of action of miltefosine is likely to involve interaction with lipids (phospholipids and sterols), including membrane lipids, inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase (mitochondrial function), and apoptosis-like cell death. Activity In Vitro and In Vivo Miltefosine has anti-leishmanial activity in vitro and in clinical infections [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Sensitivity of different Leishmania species as well as different strains of a Leishmania species to miltefosine may vary in different geographic regions. Drug Resistance In vitro studies show a potential for development of resistance to miltefosine. Some strains of L. braziliensis with intrinsic resistance to miltefosine have been identified . However, the clinical relevance of these observations is not known. Drug resistance could be due to a decrease in miltefosine accumulation within Leishmania parasite which is thought to be due to either an increase in drug efflux, mediated by the overexpression of the ABC transporter P-glycoprotein and/or a decrease in drug uptake by the inactivation of the miltefosine transport machinery that consists of the miltefosine transporter and its beta subunit. Mutation in the transporter gene was reported in the isolates from a relapsed patient in one study. However, the clinical relevance of these findings is not known."

Weight ranged between 15 and 67 kg (mean weight 38.6 kg) and BMI ranged between 8.2 and 24 (mean 16.1). No patient weighed more than 70kg. Amphotericin B was administered intravenously over 6 continuous hours at 1 mg/kg every other day for 15 doses. Patients were hospitalized for the duration of therapy. Exclusion criteria included platelet count <50 \u00d7 10 9 /L, white cell count <1 \u00d7 10 9 /L, hemoglobin <6 g/100 mL, AST or ALT \u22653 times upper limit of the normal range, bilirubin \u22652 times upper limit of the normal range, serum creatinine or BUN >1.5 times upper limit of the normal range, prothrombin time >5 seconds above control, and any non-compensated or uncontrolled condition including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Women of reproductive potential were required to use effective contraception for the duration of therapy and for 2 months post therapy. Final cure was defined as initial cure at end of therapy plus absence of signs and symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis at 6 months follow up. Initial cure at the end of therapy was evaluated by repeat spleen or bone marrow aspiration. Patients with initial parasitologic cure were followed for 6 months; patients without absence of clinical signs and symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis were to be evaluated with repeat spleen or bone marrow aspiration to determine final cure. Two hundred and ninety nine (299) patients received IMPAVIDO and 99 patients received amphotericin B. Approximately, 70% of patients in each arm had previously failed treatment with pentavalent antimony. Initial cure was achieved in 98% of patients in each treatment arm. At 6 months after therapy, 88 (29.5%) IMPAVIDO recipients and 12 (12.1%) amphotericin B recipients continued to have signs and symptoms suggestive of visceral leishmaniasis. These signs or symptoms were attributed to alternative diagnosis in 73 patients. The remaining 27 patients, all in the IMPAVIDO arm, underwent evaluation with splenic or bone marrow aspiration, and 9 (3.0%) were positive for Leishmania amastigotes, indicating relapse. The final cure rates for IMPAVIDO and amphotericin B were 94% and 97%, respectively. Table 6: Efficacy of IMPAVIDO in Visceral Leishmaniasis in Patients \u226512 years of Age in India IMPAVIDO N = 299 Amphotericin B Deoxycholate N = 99 End of therapy Initial Cure 293 (98%) 97 (98%) 6 months after therapy Final Cure The 95% exact confidence interval for the difference (IV Amphotericin B \u2013 IMPAVIDO) in final cure is (-3.0%, 6.8%). 282 (94%) 96 (97%) Treatment Failure 9 (3%) 0 (0) Not Assessable 8 (3%) 3 (3%) 14.2 Treatment of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis A placebo controlled study was performed in Colombia where L. panamensis and L. braziliensis are epidemiologically known to be the prevalent infecting Leishmania species, and in Guatemala where L. braziliensis is epidemiologically known to be the prevalent infecting species. The study included male and female patients older than 12 years of age who had newly diagnosed or relapsing cutaneous leishmaniasis without mucosal involvement, parasitologically confirmed, presenting with at least one skin ulcer with minimum area of 50 mm 2 . Exclusion criteria were AST or ALT \u22652 times upper limit of normal range, bilirubin \u22651.5 times upper limit of normal range, and serum creatinine or BUN >1.5 times upper limit of normal range. Women of reproductive potential were required to use effective contraception for the duration of therapy and for 2 months post therapy. Patients were randomized to receive IMPAVIDO or placebo in a 2:1 allocation. Patients who weighed < 45 kg received IMPAVIDO 50 mg capsule twice a day, and patients who weighed \u226545 kg received IMPAVIDO 50 mg capsule three times a day. No patient weighed more than 84 kg. Definite cure was defined as apparent (complete epithelialization of all lesions) or partial cure (incomplete epithelialization, no enlargement by > 50% in lesions, no appearance of new lesions, and negative parasitology if done) at 2 weeks after end of therapy and complete epithelialization of all ulcers at 6 months after end of therapy. The definite cure rate for IMPAVIDO was statistically significantly higher than the cure rate for placebo. Table 7: Efficacy of IMPAVIDO Compared to Placebo in the Treatment of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Colombia and Guatemala IMPAVIDO Placebo Definite Cure The difference (95% CI) between groups is 36.8% (20.1%, 53.4%) with P-value<0.0001. 59/89 (66%) 13/44 (30%) Colombia 40/49 (82%) 9/24 (38%) Guatemala 19/40 (48%) 4/20 (20%) An additional study of IMPAVIDO was conducted in Bahia and Manaus, two regions in Brazil where respectively L. braziliensis and L. guyanensis are epidemiologically the prevalent infecting pathogens. Adolescent/adult patients aged 12-65 years received IMPAVIDO orally for 28 days. IMPAVIDO target dose was 2.5 mg/kg/day: patients weighing 15-29 kg received 50 mg once daily, patients weighing 30-45 kg received 50 twice mg daily and patients weighing > 46 kg received 50 mg three times daily. The efficacy criteria were initial cure (complete re-epithelialization of the ulcer at 2 months after the end of therapy) followed by definite cure (complete re-epithelialization at 6 months after the end of therapy). Definite cure rate in patients aged \u226512 years was 27/40 (67.5%) for Manaus, Brazil and 34/40 (85%) for Bahia, Brazil. 14.3 Treatment of Mucosal Leishmaniasis A single arm study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of IMPAVIDO capsules for the treatment of mucosal leishmaniasis. The study was conducted in Bolivia where L. braziliensis is epidemiologically the prevalent species. Seventy nine (79) patients \u226518 years of age with a cutaneous leishmaniasis scar plus parasites observed or cultured from lesion material or a positive skin test, andno clinically significant concomitant disease received miltefosine at a target dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days.By 12 months after the end of therapy, 49 of the patients (62%) had complete resolution of edema, erythema, infiltration and erosion from the involved mucosal sites."
