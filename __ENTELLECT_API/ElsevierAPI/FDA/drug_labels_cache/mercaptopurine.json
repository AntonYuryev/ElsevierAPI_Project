      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 The recommended starting dosage of mercaptopurine oral suspension is 1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg (50 mg/m 2 to 75 mg/m 2 ) orally once daily as part of a combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen. Adjust dose to maintain desirable absolute neutrophil count and for excessive myelosuppression. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment : Use the lowest recommended starting dose or increase the dosing interval. ( 2.3 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Hepatic Impairment : Use the lowest recommended starting dose. ( 2.3 , 8.7 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose of mercaptopurine oral suspension is 1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg (50 mg/m 2 to 75 mg/m 2 ) orally once daily as part of combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen. Take mercaptopurine oral suspension either consistently with or without food. After initiating mercaptopurine, monitor complete blood counts (CBC) and adjust the dose to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for excessive myelosuppression. Evaluate the bone marrow in patients with prolonged myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression to assess leukemia status and marrow cellularity. Evaluate thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) status in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . If a patient misses a dose, instruct the patient to continue with the next scheduled dose. 2.2 Dosage Modifications in Patients with TPMT and NUDT15 Deficiency Consider testing for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency in patients who experience severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )] . Homozygous Deficiency in either TPMT or NUDT15 Patients with homozygous deficiency of either enzyme typically require 10% or less of the recommended dosage. Reduce the recommended starting dosage of mercaptopurine in patients who are known to have homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency. Heterozygous Deficiency in TPMT and/or NUDT15 Reduce the mercaptopurine dosage based on tolerability. Most patients with heterozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency tolerate recommended dosage, but some require dose reduction based on adverse reactions. Patients who are heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15 may require more substantial dose reductions. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Renal and Hepatic Impairment Renal Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for mercaptopurine in patients with renal impairment (CLcr less than 50 mL/min). Adjust the dosage to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Uses in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Hepatic Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for mercaptopurine in patients with hepatic impairment. Adjust the dosage to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Uses in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . 2.4 Dosage Modification with Concomitant Use of Allopurinol Reduce the dose of mercaptopurine to one-third to one-quarter of the current dosage when coadministered with allopurinol [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.5 Administration Shake the bottle vigorously for at least 30 seconds to ensure the oral suspension is well mixed. Mercaptopurine oral suspension is a pink to brown viscous oral suspension. Provide a press-in bottle adapter and two oral dispensing syringes (one 1 mL and one 5 mL). Train patients or caregivers on proper handling, storage, administration, disposal and clean-up of accidental spillage prior to initiation of mercaptopurine oral suspension and during each visit to the clinic. Advise patients and caregivers to use mercaptopurine oral suspension within 8 weeks and properly discard remaining mercaptopurine oral suspension after 8 weeks. Provide instructions regarding which syringe to use and how to administer the specified dose, since mercaptopurine oral suspension is supplied with 1 mL and 5 mL oral dispensing syringes. Advise patients that the oral dispensing syringe is intended for multiple uses and provide the following instructions: \u2022 Wash the oral dispensing syringe with warm \u2018soapy\u2019 water and rinse well; \u2022 Hold the oral dispensing syringe under water and move the plunger up and down several times to make sure the inside of the oral dispensing syringe is clean; \u2022 Ensure the oral dispensing syringe is completely dry before use of the oral dispensing syringe again; and \u2022 Store the oral dispensing syringe in a hygienic place with mercaptopurine oral suspension. Mercaptopurine is a hazardous drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myelosuppression : Monitor complete blood count (CBC) and adjust the dose of mercaptopurine for excessive myelosuppression. Consider testing in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency. Patients with homozygous-TPMT or homozygous-NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction. ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity : Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. Withhold mercaptopurine at onset of hepatotoxicity. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Immunosuppression : Response to all vaccines may be diminished and there is a risk of infection with live virus vaccines. Consult immunization guidelines for immunocompromised pediatrics. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Treatment Related Malignancies : Aggressive and fatal cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have occurred. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Macrophage Activation Syndrome : Monitor for and treat promptly; discontinue mercaptopurine. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.6 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) \u2022 Phenylketonuria : Patients should be informed that mercaptopurine oral suspension contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each mL of the 20 mg/mL oral suspension contains 0.015 mg of phenylalanine. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression The most consistent, dose-related adverse reaction of mercaptopurine is myelosuppression, manifested by anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or any combination of these. Monitor CBC and adjust the dosage of mercaptopurine for excessive myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Consider testing for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) and NUDT15 genotyping can identify patients who have reduced activity of these enzymes. Patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )] . Myelosuppression can be exacerbated by coadministration with allopurinol, aminosalicylates or other products that cause myelosuppression [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.3 , 7.4 )] . Reduce the dosage of mercaptopurine when coadministered with allopurinol [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Mercaptopurine is hepatotoxic. There are reports of deaths attributed to hepatic necrosis associated with the administration of mercaptopurine. Hepatic injury can occur with any dosage but seems to occur with greater frequency when the recommended dosage is exceeded. In some patients, jaundice has cleared following withdrawal of mercaptopurine and reappeared with rechallenge. Usually, clinically detectable jaundice appears early in the course of treatment (1 to 2 months); however, jaundice has been reported as early as 1 week and as late as 8 years after starting mercaptopurine. The hepatotoxicity has been associated in some cases with anorexia, diarrhea, jaundice, ascites, and pruritus. Hepatic encephalopathy has occurred. Monitor serum transaminase levels, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels at weekly intervals when first beginning therapy and at monthly intervals thereafter. Monitor liver tests more frequently in patients who are receiving mercaptopurine with other hepatotoxic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] or with known pre-existing liver disease. Withhold mercaptopurine at onset of hepatotoxicity. Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy Postmarketing cases of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) have been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who received mercaptopurine during pregnancy. Mercaptopurine is not indicated for use in inflammatory bowel disease [see Indications and Usage ( 1.1 )] . Discontinue mercaptopurine if ICP develops in a pregnant woman . 5.3 Immunosuppression Mercaptopurine is immunosuppressive and may impair the immune response to infectious agents or vaccines. Due to the immunosuppression associated with maintenance chemotherapy for ALL, response to all vaccines may be diminished and there is a risk of infection with live virus vaccines. Consult immunization guidelines for immunocompromised patients. 5.4 Treatment Related Malignancies Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been reported in patients treated with mercaptopurine for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), an unapproved use. Mercaptopurine is mutagenic in animals and humans, carcinogenic in animals, and may increase the risk of secondary malignancies. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including mercaptopurine, are at an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders and other malignancies, notably skin cancers (melanoma and non-melanoma), sarcomas (Kaposi\u2019s and non-Kaposi\u2019s) and uterine cervical cancer in situ. The increased risk appears to be related to the degree and duration of immunosuppression. It has been reported that discontinuation of immunosuppression may provide partial regression of the lymphoproliferative disorder. A treatment regimen containing multiple immunosuppressants (including thiopurines) should therefore be used with caution as this could lead to lymphoproliferative disorders, some with reported fatalities. A combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. 5.5 Macrophage Activation Syndrome Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in patients with autoimmune conditions, in particular with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and there could potentially be an increased susceptibility for developing the condition with the use of mercaptopurine (an unapproved use). If MAS occurs, or is suspected, discontinue mercaptopurine. Monitor for and promptly treat infections such as EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV), as these are known triggers for MAS. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Mercaptopurine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. An increased incidence of miscarriage has been reported in women who received mercaptopurine in the first trimester of pregnancy. Adverse embryo-fetal findings, including miscarriage and stillbirth, have been reported in women who received mercaptopurine after the first trimester of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . 5.7 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that mercaptopurine oral suspension contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each mL of the mercaptopurine oral suspension, 20 mg/mL contains 0.015 mg of phenylalanine."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Treatment Related Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Macrophage Activation Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] The most common adverse reaction (>20%) is myelosuppression, including anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions occurring in 5% to 20% of patients include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-800-962-8364 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Based on multicenter cooperative group ALL trials, the most common adverse reaction occurring in > 20% of patients was myelosuppression, including anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions occurring in 5% to 20% of patients included anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise, and rash. Adverse reactions occurring in < 5% of patients included urticaria, hyperuricemia, oral lesions, elevated transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperpigmentation, infections, and pancreatitis. Oral lesions resemble thrush rather than antifolic ulcerations. Delayed or late toxicities include hepatic fibrosis, hyperbilirubinemia, alopecia, pulmonary fibrosis, oligospermia and secondary malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 )] . Drug fever has been reported with mercaptopurine. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of mercaptopurine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions include: photosensitivity, hypoglycemia, portal hypertension, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), pellagra, and erythema nodosum."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Allopurinol : Reduce the dose of mercaptopurine when coadministered with allopurinol. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Warfarin : Mercaptopurine may decrease the anticoagulant effect. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Allopurinol Allopurinol can inhibit the first-pass oxidative metabolism of mercaptopurine by xanthine oxidase, which can lead to an increased risk of mercaptopurine adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Reduce the dose of mercaptopurine when coadministered with allopurinol [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . 7.2 Warfarin The coadministration of mercaptopurine with warfarin may decrease the anticoagulant effectiveness of warfarin. Monitor the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin and adjust the warfarin dosage as appropriate. 7.3 Myelosuppressive Products Mercaptopurine can cause myelosuppression. Myelosuppression may be increased when mercaptopurine is coadministered with other drugs that cause myelosuppression. Enhanced myelosuppression has been noted in some patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Monitor the CBC and adjust the dose of mercaptopurine for excessive myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 7.4 Aminosalicylates Aminosalicylates (e.g., mesalamine, olsalazine or sulfasalazine) may inhibit the TPMT enzyme, which may increase the risk of myelosuppression when coadministered with mercaptopurine. When aminosalicylates and mercaptopurine are coadministered, use the lowest possible doses for each drug and monitor more frequently for myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 7.5 Hepatotoxic Products Mercaptopurine can cause hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity may be increased when mercaptopurine is coadministered with other products that cause hepatotoxicity. Monitor liver tests more frequently in patients who are receiving mercaptopurine with other hepatotoxic products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.6 Methotrexate Mercaptopurine dosage may need adjustment when administered concomitantly with high dose methotrexate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Mercaptopurine exposure increases with concomitant methotrexate use [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] which may increase the risk of mercaptopurine adverse reactions. The mechanism of this interaction has not been fully characterized [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mercaptopurine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . Pregnant women who receive mercaptopurine have an increased incidence of miscarriage and stillbirth (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Women receiving mercaptopurine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased incidence of miscarriage; the risk of malformation in offspring surviving first trimester exposure is not known. In a series of 28 women receiving mercaptopurine after the first trimester of pregnancy, 3 mothers died prior to delivery, 1 delivered a stillborn child, and 1 aborted; there were no cases of macroscopically abnormal fetuses. Animal Data Mercaptopurine was embryo-lethal and teratogenic in several animal species (rat, mouse, rabbit, and hamster) at doses less than the recommended human dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of mercaptopurine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with mercaptopurine and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Mercaptopurine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating mercaptopurine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine and for 3 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Infertility Females and Males Based on findings from animal studies, mercaptopurine can impair female and male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . The long-term effects of mercaptopurine on female and male fertility, including the reversibility have not been studied. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mercaptopurine has been established in pediatric patients. Use of mercaptopurine in pediatrics is supported by evidence from the published literature and clinical experience. Symptomatic hypoglycemia has been reported in pediatric patients with ALL receiving mercaptopurine. Reported cases were in pediatrics less than 6 years or with a low body mass index. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mercaptopurine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or another drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for mercaptopurine or increase the dosing interval to every 36 to 48 hours in patients with renal impairment (CLcr less than 50 mL/min). Adjust the dose to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for mercaptopurine in patients with hepatic impairment.

Dialysis cannot be expected to clear mercaptopurine. Hemodialysis is thought to be of marginal use due to the rapid intracellular incorporation of mercaptopurine into active metabolites with long persistence. Withhold mercaptopurine immediately if severe or life-threatening adverse reactions occur during treatment. If a patient is seen immediately following an accidental overdosage, it may be useful to induce emesis."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mercaptopurine is a purine analog that undergoes intracellular transport and activation to form metabolites including thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs). Incorporation of TGNs into DNA or RNA results in cell-cycle arrest and cell death. TGNs and other mercaptopurine metabolites are also inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis and purine nucleotide interconversions. Mercaptopurine was cytotoxic to proliferating cancer cells in vitro and had antitumor activity in mouse tumor models. It is not known which of the biochemical effects of mercaptopurine and its metabolites are directly or predominantly responsible for cell death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationships Mercaptopurine exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following a single oral dose of mercaptopurine 50 mg under fasted conditions to adult healthy subjects, the median (min \u2013 max) AUC 0-INF was 137 h\u2219ng/mL (77 \u2013 268 h\u2219ng/mL) and C max was 93 ng/mL (40 \u2013 204 ng/mL). Absorption Mercaptopurine is absorbed after oral administration with a median (min \u2013 max) T max of 0.75 (0.33 \u2013 2.5) hours. Effect of Food Food has been shown to decrease the exposure of mercaptopurine. Distribution The volume of distribution exceeds total body water with a mean volume of distribution of approximately 0.9 L/kg. There is negligible entry of mercaptopurine into cerebrospinal fluid. Plasma protein binding averages 19% over the concentration range 10 to 50 mcg/L. Elimination The median (min \u2013 max) elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) was 1.3 (0.9 \u2013 5.4) hours. Metabolism Mercaptopurine is inactivated via two major pathways. One is thiol methylation, which is catalyzed by the polymorphic enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), to form the inactive metabolite methyl-mercaptopurine. The second inactivation pathway is oxidation, which is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase. The product of oxidation is the inactive metabolite 6-thiouric acid. Elimination After oral administration of mercaptopurine, urine contains intact mercaptopurine, thiouric acid (formed by direct oxidation by xanthine oxidase, probably via 6-mercapto-8-hydroxypurine), and a number of 6-methylated thiopurines. In one subject, a total of 46% of the dose could be accounted for in the urine (as parent drug and metabolites) in the first 24 hours. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Wide inter individual variations in systemic exposure is observed. Following oral administration of 50 mg/m 2 mercaptopurine in 10 children, median plasma concentrations 1 hour post dose was 0.35 (range 0.03 to 1.03) \u03bcM and median AUC 1\u20135hours was 56 (range 23 to 65) \u03bcM\u00b7min. T max ranged from 1 to 3 hours. Drug Interactions Studies Methotrexate: Mercaptopurine AUC increased by approximately 31% when coadministered with oral methotrexate 20 mg/m 2 . Mercaptopurine AUC increased by 69% when coadministered with IV methotrexate 2 g/m 2 , and by 93% when coadministered with IV methotrexate 5 g/m 2 . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics Several published studies indicate that patients with reduced TPMT or NUDT15 activity receiving usual doses of mercaptopurine, accumulate excessive cellular concentrations of active 6-TGNs, and are at higher risk for severe myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . In a study of 1028 children with ALL, the approximate tolerated mercaptopurine dosage for patients with TPMT and/or NUDT15 deficiency on mercaptopurine maintenance therapy (as a percentage of the planned dosage) was as follows: heterozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15, 50-90%; heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15, 30-50%; homozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15, 5-10%. Approximately 0.3% (1:300) of patients of European or African ancestry have two loss-of-function alleles of the TPMT gene and have little or no TPMT activity (homozygous deficient or poor metabolizers), and approximately 10% of patients have one loss-of-function TPMT allele leading to intermediate TPMT activity (heterozygous deficient or intermediate metabolizers). The TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, and TPMT*3C alleles account for about 95% of individuals with reduced levels of TPMT activity. NUDT15 deficiency is detected in <1% of patients of European or African ancestry. Among patients of East Asian ancestry (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese), 2% have two loss-of-function alleles of the NUDT15 gene, and approximately 21% have one loss-of-function allele. The p.R139C variant of NUDT15 (present on the *2 and *3 alleles) is the most commonly observed, but other less common loss-of-function NUDT15 alleles have been observed. Consider all clinical information when interpreting results from phenotypic testing used to determine the level of thiopurine nucleotides or TPMT activity in erythrocytes, since some coadministered drugs can influence measurement of TPMT activity in blood, and blood from recent transfusions will misrepresent a patient\u2019s actual TPMT activity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following a single oral dose of mercaptopurine 50 mg under fasted conditions to adult healthy subjects, the median (min \u2013 max) AUC 0-INF was 137 h\u2219ng/mL (77 \u2013 268 h\u2219ng/mL) and C max was 93 ng/mL (40 \u2013 204 ng/mL). Absorption Mercaptopurine is absorbed after oral administration with a median (min \u2013 max) T max of 0.75 (0.33 \u2013 2.5) hours. Effect of Food Food has been shown to decrease the exposure of mercaptopurine. Distribution The volume of distribution exceeds total body water with a mean volume of distribution of approximately 0.9 L/kg. There is negligible entry of mercaptopurine into cerebrospinal fluid. Plasma protein binding averages 19% over the concentration range 10 to 50 mcg/L. Elimination The median (min \u2013 max) elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) was 1.3 (0.9 \u2013 5.4) hours. Metabolism Mercaptopurine is inactivated via two major pathways. One is thiol methylation, which is catalyzed by the polymorphic enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), to form the inactive metabolite methyl-mercaptopurine. The second inactivation pathway is oxidation, which is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase. The product of oxidation is the inactive metabolite 6-thiouric acid. Elimination After oral administration of mercaptopurine, urine contains intact mercaptopurine, thiouric acid (formed by direct oxidation by xanthine oxidase, probably via 6-mercapto-8-hydroxypurine), and a number of 6-methylated thiopurines. In one subject, a total of 46% of the dose could be accounted for in the urine (as parent drug and metabolites) in the first 24 hours. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Wide inter individual variations in systemic exposure is observed. Following oral administration of 50 mg/m 2 mercaptopurine in 10 children, median plasma concentrations 1 hour post dose was 0.35 (range 0.03 to 1.03) \u03bcM and median AUC 1\u20135hours was 56 (range 23 to 65) \u03bcM\u00b7min. T max ranged from 1 to 3 hours. Drug Interactions Studies Methotrexate: Mercaptopurine AUC increased by approximately 31% when coadministered with oral methotrexate 20 mg/m 2 . Mercaptopurine AUC increased by 69% when coadministered with IV methotrexate 2 g/m 2 , and by 93% when coadministered with IV methotrexate 5 g/m 2 ."

    "pharmacogenomics": [
      "12.5 Pharmacogenomics Several published studies indicate that patients with reduced TPMT or NUDT15 activity receiving usual doses of mercaptopurine, accumulate excessive cellular concentrations of active 6-TGNs, and are at higher risk for severe myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . In a study of 1028 children with ALL, the approximate tolerated mercaptopurine dosage for patients with TPMT and/or NUDT15 deficiency on mercaptopurine maintenance therapy (as a percentage of the planned dosage) was as follows: heterozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15, 50-90%; heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15, 30-50%; homozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15, 5-10%. Approximately 0.3% (1:300) of patients of European or African ancestry have two loss-of-function alleles of the TPMT gene and have little or no TPMT activity (homozygous deficient or poor metabolizers), and approximately 10% of patients have one loss-of-function TPMT allele leading to intermediate TPMT activity (heterozygous deficient or intermediate metabolizers). The TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, and TPMT*3C alleles account for about 95% of individuals with reduced levels of TPMT activity. NUDT15 deficiency is detected in <1% of patients of European or African ancestry. Among patients of East Asian ancestry (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese), 2% have two loss-of-function alleles of the NUDT15 gene, and approximately 21% have one loss-of-function allele. The p.R139C variant of NUDT15 (present on the *2 and *3 alleles) is the most commonly observed, but other less common loss-of-function NUDT15 alleles have been observed. Consider all clinical information when interpreting results from phenotypic testing used to determine the level of thiopurine nucleotides or TPMT activity in erythrocytes, since some coadministered drugs can influence measurement of TPMT activity in blood, and blood from recent transfusions will misrepresent a patient\u2019s actual TPMT activity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 The recommended starting dose of mercaptopurine tablets is 1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg orally once daily as part of a combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen. Adjust dose to maintain desirable absolute neutrophil count and for excessive myelosuppression. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment : Use the lowest recommended starting dose or increase the dosing interval. ( 2.3 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Hepatic Impairment : Use the lowest recommended starting dose. ( 2.3 , 8.7 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dosage of mercaptopurine tablets is 1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg orally once daily as part of combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen. A recommended dosage for patients less than 17 kg is not achievable, because the only available strength is 50 mg. Take mercaptopurine tablets either consistently with or without food. After initiating mercaptopurine tablets, monitor complete blood count (CBC) and adjust the dose to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for excessive myelosuppression. Evaluate the bone marrow in patients with prolonged myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression to assess leukemia status and marrow cellularity. Evaluate thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) status in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes or myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Do not administer to patients who are unable to swallow tablets. If a patient misses a dose, instruct the patient to continue with the next scheduled dose. Mercaptopurine tablets are a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 2.2 Dosage Modifications in Patients with TPMT and NUDT15 Deficiency Consider testing for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency in patients who experience severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Homozygous Deficiency in either TPMT or NUDT15 Patients with homozygous deficiency of either enzyme typically require 10% or less of the recommended dosage. Reduce the recommended starting dosage of mercaptopurine tablets in patients who are known to have homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency. Heterozygous Deficiency in TPMT and/or NUDT15 Reduce the mercaptopurine tablets dose based on tolerability. Most patients with heterozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency tolerate the recommended dosage, but some require a dose reduction based on adverse reactions. Patients who are heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15 may require more substantial dose reductions. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Renal and Hepatic Impairment Renal Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for mercaptopurine tablets in patients with renal impairment (CLcr less than 50 mL/min). Adjust the dosage to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Uses in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Hepatic Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for mercaptopurine tablets in patients with hepatic impairment. Adjust the dosage to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Uses in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 2.4 Dosage Modification with Concomitant Use of Allopurinol Reduce the dose of mercaptopurine tablets to one-third to one-quarter of the current dosage when coadministered with allopurinol [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myelosuppression : Monitor complete blood count (CBC) and adjust the dose of mercaptopurine tablets for excessive myelosuppression. Consider testing in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency. Patients with homozygous or homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction. ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity : Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. Withhold mercaptopurine tablets at onset of hepatotoxicity. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Immunosuppression : Response to all vaccines may be diminished and there is a risk of infection with live virus vaccines. Consult immunization guidelines for immunocompromised patients. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Treatment Related Malignancies : Aggressive and fatal cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have occurred. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Macrophage Activation Syndrome : Monitor for and treat promptly; discontinue mercaptopurine tablets. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.6 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression The most consistent, dose-related adverse reaction is myelosuppression, manifested by anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or any combination of these. Monitor CBC and adjust the dosage of mercaptopurine tablets for excessive myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Consider testing for TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) and NUDT15 genotyping can identify patients who have reduced activity of these enzymes. Patients with heterozygous or homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Myelosuppression can be exacerbated by coadministration with allopurinol, aminosalicylates or other products that cause myelosuppression [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.3 , 7.4) ] . Reduce the dose of mercaptopurine tablets when coadministered with allopurinol [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Mercaptopurine is hepatotoxic. There are reports of deaths attributed to hepatic necrosis associated with the administration of mercaptopurine. Hepatic injury can occur with any dosage but seems to occur with greater frequency when the recommended dosage is exceeded. In some patients, jaundice has cleared following withdrawal of mercaptopurine and reappeared with rechallenge. Usually, clinically detectable jaundice appears early in the course of treatment (1 to 2 months); however, jaundice has been reported as early as 1 week and as late as 8 years after the starting mercaptopurine. The hepatotoxicity has been associated in some cases with anorexia, diarrhea, jaundice, ascites, and pruritus . Hepatic encephalopathy has occurred. Monitor serum transaminase levels, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels at weekly intervals when first beginning therapy and at monthly intervals thereafter. Monitor liver tests more frequently in patients who are receiving mercaptopurine tablets with other hepatotoxic products [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] or with known pre-existing liver disease. Withhold mercaptopurine tablets at onset of hepatotoxicity. Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy Postmarketing cases of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) have been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who received mercaptopurine during pregnancy. Mercaptopurine tablets are not indicated for use in inflammatory bowel disease [see Indications and Usage (1.1) ] . Discontinue mercaptopurine tablets if ICP develops in a pregnant woman. 5.3 Immunosuppression Mercaptopurine is immunosuppressive and may impair the immune response to infectious agents or vaccines. Due to the immunosuppression associated with maintenance chemotherapy for ALL, response to all vaccines may be diminished and there is a risk of infection with live virus vaccines. Consult immunization guidelines for immunocompromised patients. 5.4 Treatment Related Malignancies Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been reported in patients treated with mercaptopurine for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), an unapproved use. Mercaptopurine is mutagenic in animals and humans, carcinogenic in animals, and may increase the risk of secondary malignancies. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including mercaptopurine, are at an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders and other malignancies, notably skin cancers (melanoma and non-melanoma), sarcomas (Kaposi's and non-Kaposi's) and uterine cervical cancer in situ. The increased risk appears to be related to the degree and duration of immunosuppression. It has been reported that discontinuation of immunosuppression may provide partial regression of the lymphoproliferative disorder. A treatment regimen containing multiple immunosuppressants (including thiopurines) should therefore be used with caution as this could lead to lymphoproliferative disorders, some with reported fatalities. A combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. 5.5 Macrophage Activation Syndrome Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in patients with autoimmune conditions, in particular with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and there could potentially be an increased susceptibility for developing the condition with the use of mercaptopurine (an unapproved use). If MAS occurs, or is suspected, discontinue mercaptopurine tablets. Monitor for and promptly treat infections such as EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV), as these are known triggers for MAS. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Mercaptopurine tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. An increased incidence of miscarriage has been reported in women who received mercaptopurine in the first trimester of pregnancy. Adverse embryo-fetal findings, including miscarriage and stillbirth, have been reported in women who received mercaptopurine after the first trimester of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine tablets and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine tablets and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Treatment related malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Macrophage activation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The most common adverse reaction (> 20%) is myelosuppression, including anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions occurring in 5% to 20% of patients include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Based on multicenter cooperative group ALL trials, the most common adverse reaction occurring in > 20% of patients was myelosuppression, including anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions occurring in 5% to 20% of patients included anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise and rash. Adverse reactions occurring in < 5 % of patients included urticaria, hyperuricemia, oral lesions, increased transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperpigmentation, infections, and pancreatitis. Oral lesions resemble thrush rather than antifolic ulcerations. Delayed or late adverse reactions include hepatic fibrosis, hyperbilirubinemia, alopecia, pulmonary fibrosis, oligospermia and secondary malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ] . Drug fever has been reported with mercaptopurine. Additional adverse reactions that have been reported in patients who have received mercaptopurine include photosensitivity, hypoglycemia, and portal hypertension. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of mercaptopurine tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions include: intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Allopurinol : Reduce the dose of mercaptopurine tablets when co-administered with allopurinol. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Warfarin : Mercaptopurine tablets may decrease the anticoagulant effect. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Allopurinol Allopurinol can inhibit the first-pass oxidative metabolism of mercaptopurine by xanthine oxidase, which can lead to an increased risk of mercaptopurine adverse reactions (i.e., myelosuppression, nausea, and vomiting) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Reduce the dose of mercaptopurine tablets when coadministered with allopurinol [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 7.2 Warfarin The concomitant administration of mercaptopurine tablets and warfarin may decrease the anticoagulant effectiveness of warfarin. Monitor the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin and adjust the warfarin dosage as appropriate. 7.3 Myelosuppressive Products Mercaptopurine tablets can cause myelosuppression. Myelosuppression may be increased when mercaptopurine tablets are coadministered with other products that cause myelosuppression. Enhanced myelosuppression has been noted in some patients also receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Monitor the CBC and adjust the dose of mercaptopurine tablets for excessive myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 7.4 Aminosalicylates Aminosalicylates (e.g., mesalamine, olsalazine or sulfasalazine) may inhibit the TPMT enzyme, which may increase the risk of myelosuppression when coadministered with mercaptopurine tablets.

( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mercaptopurine tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Pregnant women who receive mercaptopurine have an increased incidence of miscarriage and stillbirth (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Women receiving mercaptopurine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased incidence of miscarriage; the risk of malformation in offspring surviving first trimester exposure is not known. In a series of 28 women receiving mercaptopurine after the first trimester of pregnancy, 3 mothers died prior to delivery, 1 delivered a stillborn child, and 1 aborted; there were no cases of macroscopically abnormal fetuses. Animal Data Mercaptopurine was embryo-lethal and teratogenic in several animal species (rat, mouse, rabbit, and hamster) at doses less than the recommended human dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of mercaptopurine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with mercaptopurine tablets and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Mercaptopurine tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating mercaptopurine tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine tablets and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine tablets and for 3 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Females and Males Based on findings from animal studies, mercaptopurine tablets can impair female and male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . The long-term effects of mercaptopurine on female and male fertility, including the reversibility have not been studied. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mercaptopurine tablets have been established in pediatric patients. Use of mercaptopurine tablets in pediatrics is supported by evidence from the published literature and clinical experience. Symptomatic hypoglycemia has been reported in pediatric patients with ALL receiving mercaptopurine. Reported cases were in pediatrics less than 6 years of age or with a low body mass index. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mercaptopurine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or another drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for mercaptopurine tablets or increase the dosing interval to every 36-48 hours in patients with renal impairment (CLcr less than 50 mL/min). Adjust the dose to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for mercaptopurine tablets in patients with hepatic impairment.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mercaptopurine is a purine analog that undergoes intracellular transport and activation to form metabolites including thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs). Incorporation of TGNs into DNA or RNA results in cell-cycle arrest and cell death. TGNs and other mercaptopurine metabolites are also inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis and purine nucleotide interconversions. Mercaptopurine was cytotoxic to proliferating cancer cells in vitro and had antitumor activity in mouse tumor models. It is not known which of the biochemical effects of mercaptopurine and its metabolites are directly or predominantly responsible for cell death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationships Mercaptopurine exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following a single oral dose of mercaptopurine 50 mg under fasted conditions to adult healthy subjects, the mean AUC 0-INF was 129 h\u2022ng/mL and C max was 69 ng/mL. Absorption Food Effect Food has been shown to decrease the exposure of mercaptopurine. Distribution The volume of distribution usually exceeded that of the total body water. There is negligible entry of mercaptopurine into cerebrospinal fluid. Plasma protein binding averages 19% over the concentration range 10 to 50 mcg/mL (a concentration only achieved by intravenous administration of mercaptopurine at doses exceeding 5 to 10 mg/kg). Elimination The elimination half-life is less than 2 hours following a single oral dose. Metabolism Mercaptopurine is inactivated via two major pathways. One is thiol methylation, which is catalyzed by the polymorphic enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), to form the inactive metabolite methyl-mercaptopurine. The second inactivation pathway is oxidation, which is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase. The product of oxidation is the inactive metabolite 6-thiouric acid. Excretion Following the oral administration of radiolabeled mercaptopurine, 46% of the dose was recovered in the urine (as parent drug and metabolites) in the first 24 hours. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics Several published studies indicate that patients with reduced TPMT or NUDT15 activity receiving usual doses of mercaptopurine, accumulate excessive cellular concentrations of active 6-TGNs, and are at higher risk for severe myelosuppression. In a study of 1028 children with ALL, the approximate tolerated mercaptopurine dosage for patients with TPMT and/or NUDT15 deficiency on mercaptopurine maintenance therapy (as a percentage of the planned dosage) was as follows: heterozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15, 50-90%; heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15, 30-50%; homozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15, 5-10%. Approximately 0.3% (1:300) of patients of European or African ancestry have two loss-of-function alleles of the TPMT gene and have little or no TPMT activity (homozygous deficient or poor metabolizers), and approximately 10% of patients have one loss-of-function TPMT allele leading to intermediate TPMT activity (heterozygous deficient or intermediate metabolizers). The TPMT * 2, TPMT * 3A, and TPMT * 3C alleles account for about 95% of individuals with reduced levels of TPMT activity. NUDT15 deficiency is detected in < 1% of patients of European or African ancestry. Among patients of East Asian ancestry (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese), 2% have two loss-of-function alleles of the NUDT15 gene, and approximately 21% have one loss-of-function allele. The p.R139C variant of NUDT15 (present on the * 2 and * 3 alleles) is the most commonly observed, but other less common loss-of-function NUDT15 alleles have been observed. Consider all clinical information when interpreting results from phenotypic testing used to determine the level of thiopurine nucleotides or TPMT activity in erythrocytes, since some coadministered drugs can influence measurement of TPMT activity in blood and blood from recent transfusions will misrepresent a patient\u2019s actual TPMT activity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

Adjust dose to maintain desirable absolute neutrophil count and for excessive myelosuppression. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment : Use the lowest recommended starting dose or increase the dosing interval. ( 2.3 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Hepatic Impairment : Use the lowest recommended starting dose. ( 2.3 , 8.7 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose of mercaptopurine oral suspension is 1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg (50 mg/m 2 to 75 mg/m 2 ) orally once daily as part of combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen. Take mercaptopurine oral suspension either consistently with or without food. After initiating mercaptopurine, monitor complete blood counts (CBC) and adjust the dose to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for excessive myelosuppression. Evaluate the bone marrow in patients with prolonged myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression to assess leukemia status and marrow cellularity. Evaluate thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) status in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . If a patient misses a dose, instruct the patient to continue with the next scheduled dose. 2.2 Dosage Modifications in Patients with TPMT and NUDT15 Deficiency Consider testing for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency in patients who experience severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )] . Homozygous Deficiency in either TPMT or NUDT15 Patients with homozygous deficiency of either enzyme typically require 10% or less of the recommended dosage. Reduce the recommended starting dosage of mercaptopurine in patients who are known to have homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency. Heterozygous Deficiency in TPMT and/or NUDT15 Reduce the mercaptopurine dosage based on tolerability. Most patients with heterozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency tolerate recommended dosage, but some require dose reduction based on adverse reactions. Patients who are heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15 may require more substantial dose reductions. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Renal and Hepatic Impairment Renal Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for mercaptopurine in patients with renal impairment (CLcr less than 50 mL/min). Adjust the dosage to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Uses in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Hepatic Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for mercaptopurine in patients with hepatic impairment. Adjust the dosage to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Uses in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . 2.4 Dosage Modification with Concomitant Use of Allopurinol Reduce the dose of mercaptopurine to one-third to one-quarter of the current dosage when coadministered with allopurinol [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.5 Administration Shake the bottle vigorously for at least 30 seconds to ensure the oral suspension is well mixed. Mercaptopurine oral suspension is a pink to brown viscous oral suspension. Provide a press-in bottle adapter and two oral dispensing syringes (one 1 mL and one 5 mL). Train patients or caregivers on proper handling, storage, administration, disposal and clean-up of accidental spillage prior to initiation of mercaptopurine oral suspension and during each visit to the clinic. Advise patients and caregivers to use mercaptopurine oral suspension within 8 weeks and properly discard remaining mercaptopurine oral suspension after 8 weeks. Provide instructions regarding which syringe to use and how to administer the specified dose, since mercaptopurine oral suspension is supplied with 1 mL and 5 mL oral dispensing syringes. Advise patients that the oral dispensing syringe is intended for multiple uses and provide the following instructions: \u2022 Wash the oral dispensing syringe with warm \u2018soapy\u2019 water and rinse well; \u2022 Hold the oral dispensing syringe under water and move the plunger up and down several times to make sure the inside of the oral dispensing syringe is clean; \u2022 Ensure the oral dispensing syringe is completely dry before use of the oral dispensing syringe again; and \u2022 Store the oral dispensing syringe in a hygienic place with mercaptopurine oral suspension.

Monitor CBC and adjust the dosage of mercaptopurine for excessive myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Consider testing for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) and NUDT15 genotyping can identify patients who have reduced activity of these enzymes. Patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )] . Myelosuppression can be exacerbated by coadministration with allopurinol, aminosalicylates or other products that cause myelosuppression [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.3 , 7.4 )] . Reduce the dosage of mercaptopurine when coadministered with allopurinol [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Mercaptopurine is hepatotoxic. There are reports of deaths attributed to hepatic necrosis associated with the administration of mercaptopurine. Hepatic injury can occur with any dosage but seems to occur with greater frequency when the recommended dosage is exceeded. In some patients, jaundice has cleared following withdrawal of mercaptopurine and reappeared with rechallenge. Usually, clinically detectable jaundice appears early in the course of treatment (1 to 2 months); however, jaundice has been reported as early as 1 week and as late as 8 years after starting mercaptopurine. The hepatotoxicity has been associated in some cases with anorexia, diarrhea, jaundice, ascites, and pruritus. Hepatic encephalopathy has occurred. Monitor serum transaminase levels, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels at weekly intervals when first beginning therapy and at monthly intervals thereafter. Monitor liver tests more frequently in patients who are receiving mercaptopurine with other hepatotoxic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] or with known pre-existing liver disease. Withhold mercaptopurine at onset of hepatotoxicity. Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy Postmarketing cases of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) have been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who received mercaptopurine during pregnancy. Mercaptopurine is not indicated for use in inflammatory bowel disease [see Indications and Usage ( 1.1 )] . Discontinue mercaptopurine if ICP develops in a pregnant woman . 5.3 Immunosuppression Mercaptopurine is immunosuppressive and may impair the immune response to infectious agents or vaccines. Due to the immunosuppression associated with maintenance chemotherapy for ALL, response to all vaccines may be diminished and there is a risk of infection with live virus vaccines. Consult immunization guidelines for immunocompromised patients. 5.4 Treatment Related Malignancies Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been reported in patients treated with mercaptopurine for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), an unapproved use. Mercaptopurine is mutagenic in animals and humans, carcinogenic in animals, and may increase the risk of secondary malignancies. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including mercaptopurine, are at an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders and other malignancies, notably skin cancers (melanoma and non-melanoma), sarcomas (Kaposi\u2019s and non-Kaposi\u2019s) and uterine cervical cancer in situ. The increased risk appears to be related to the degree and duration of immunosuppression. It has been reported that discontinuation of immunosuppression may provide partial regression of the lymphoproliferative disorder. A treatment regimen containing multiple immunosuppressants (including thiopurines) should therefore be used with caution as this could lead to lymphoproliferative disorders, some with reported fatalities. A combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. 5.5 Macrophage Activation Syndrome Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in patients with autoimmune conditions, in particular with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and there could potentially be an increased susceptibility for developing the condition with the use of mercaptopurine (an unapproved use). If MAS occurs, or is suspected, discontinue mercaptopurine. Monitor for and promptly treat infections such as EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV), as these are known triggers for MAS. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Mercaptopurine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. An increased incidence of miscarriage has been reported in women who received mercaptopurine in the first trimester of pregnancy. Adverse embryo-fetal findings, including miscarriage and stillbirth, have been reported in women who received mercaptopurine after the first trimester of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . 5.7 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that mercaptopurine oral suspension contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each mL of the mercaptopurine oral suspension, 20 mg/mL contains 0.015 mg of phenylalanine."

Based on multicenter cooperative group ALL trials, the most common adverse reaction occurring in > 20% of patients was myelosuppression, including anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions occurring in 5% to 20% of patients included anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise, and rash. Adverse reactions occurring in < 5% of patients included urticaria, hyperuricemia, oral lesions, elevated transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperpigmentation, infections, and pancreatitis. Oral lesions resemble thrush rather than antifolic ulcerations. Delayed or late toxicities include hepatic fibrosis, hyperbilirubinemia, alopecia, pulmonary fibrosis, oligospermia and secondary malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 )] . Drug fever has been reported with mercaptopurine. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of mercaptopurine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions include: photosensitivity, hypoglycemia, portal hypertension, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), pellagra, and erythema nodosum."

( 7.2 ) 7.1 Allopurinol Allopurinol can inhibit the first-pass oxidative metabolism of mercaptopurine by xanthine oxidase, which can lead to an increased risk of mercaptopurine adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Reduce the dose of mercaptopurine when coadministered with allopurinol [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . 7.2 Warfarin The coadministration of mercaptopurine with warfarin may decrease the anticoagulant effectiveness of warfarin. Monitor the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin and adjust the warfarin dosage as appropriate. 7.3 Myelosuppressive Products Mercaptopurine can cause myelosuppression. Myelosuppression may be increased when mercaptopurine is coadministered with other drugs that cause myelosuppression. Enhanced myelosuppression has been noted in some patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Monitor the CBC and adjust the dose of mercaptopurine for excessive myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 7.4 Aminosalicylates Aminosalicylates (e.g., mesalamine, olsalazine or sulfasalazine) may inhibit the TPMT enzyme, which may increase the risk of myelosuppression when coadministered with mercaptopurine. When aminosalicylates and mercaptopurine are coadministered, use the lowest possible doses for each drug and monitor more frequently for myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 7.5 Hepatotoxic Products Mercaptopurine can cause hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity may be increased when mercaptopurine is coadministered with other products that cause hepatotoxicity. Monitor liver tests more frequently in patients who are receiving mercaptopurine with other hepatotoxic products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.6 Methotrexate Mercaptopurine dosage may need adjustment when administered concomitantly with high dose methotrexate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Mercaptopurine exposure increases with concomitant methotrexate use [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] which may increase the risk of mercaptopurine adverse reactions. The mechanism of this interaction has not been fully characterized [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

Pregnant women who receive mercaptopurine have an increased incidence of miscarriage and stillbirth (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Women receiving mercaptopurine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased incidence of miscarriage; the risk of malformation in offspring surviving first trimester exposure is not known. In a series of 28 women receiving mercaptopurine after the first trimester of pregnancy, 3 mothers died prior to delivery, 1 delivered a stillborn child, and 1 aborted; there were no cases of macroscopically abnormal fetuses. Animal Data Mercaptopurine was embryo-lethal and teratogenic in several animal species (rat, mouse, rabbit, and hamster) at doses less than the recommended human dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of mercaptopurine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with mercaptopurine and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Mercaptopurine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating mercaptopurine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine and for 3 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Infertility Females and Males Based on findings from animal studies, mercaptopurine can impair female and male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . The long-term effects of mercaptopurine on female and male fertility, including the reversibility have not been studied. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mercaptopurine has been established in pediatric patients. Use of mercaptopurine in pediatrics is supported by evidence from the published literature and clinical experience. Symptomatic hypoglycemia has been reported in pediatric patients with ALL receiving mercaptopurine. Reported cases were in pediatrics less than 6 years or with a low body mass index. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mercaptopurine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or another drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for mercaptopurine or increase the dosing interval to every 36 to 48 hours in patients with renal impairment (CLcr less than 50 mL/min).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mercaptopurine is a purine analog that undergoes intracellular transport and activation to form metabolites including thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs). Incorporation of TGNs into DNA or RNA results in cell-cycle arrest and cell death. TGNs and other mercaptopurine metabolites are also inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis and purine nucleotide interconversions. Mercaptopurine was cytotoxic to proliferating cancer cells in vitro and had antitumor activity in mouse tumor models. It is not known which of the biochemical effects of mercaptopurine and its metabolites are directly or predominantly responsible for cell death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationships Mercaptopurine exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following a single oral dose of mercaptopurine 50 mg under fasted conditions to adult healthy subjects, the median (min \u2013 max) AUC 0-INF was 137 h\u2219ng/mL (77 \u2013 268 h\u2219ng/mL) and C max was 93 ng/mL (40 \u2013 204 ng/mL). Absorption Mercaptopurine is absorbed after oral administration with a median (min \u2013 max) T max of 0.75 (0.33 \u2013 2.5) hours. Effect of Food Food has been shown to decrease the exposure of mercaptopurine. Distribution The volume of distribution exceeds total body water with a mean volume of distribution of approximately 0.9 L/kg. There is negligible entry of mercaptopurine into cerebrospinal fluid. Plasma protein binding averages 19% over the concentration range 10 to 50 mcg/L. Elimination The median (min \u2013 max) elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) was 1.3 (0.9 \u2013 5.4) hours. Metabolism Mercaptopurine is inactivated via two major pathways. One is thiol methylation, which is catalyzed by the polymorphic enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), to form the inactive metabolite methyl-mercaptopurine. The second inactivation pathway is oxidation, which is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase. The product of oxidation is the inactive metabolite 6-thiouric acid. Elimination After oral administration of mercaptopurine, urine contains intact mercaptopurine, thiouric acid (formed by direct oxidation by xanthine oxidase, probably via 6-mercapto-8-hydroxypurine), and a number of 6-methylated thiopurines. In one subject, a total of 46% of the dose could be accounted for in the urine (as parent drug and metabolites) in the first 24 hours. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Wide inter individual variations in systemic exposure is observed. Following oral administration of 50 mg/m 2 mercaptopurine in 10 children, median plasma concentrations 1 hour post dose was 0.35 (range 0.03 to 1.03) \u03bcM and median AUC 1\u20135hours was 56 (range 23 to 65) \u03bcM\u00b7min. T max ranged from 1 to 3 hours. Drug Interactions Studies Methotrexate: Mercaptopurine AUC increased by approximately 31% when coadministered with oral methotrexate 20 mg/m 2 . Mercaptopurine AUC increased by 69% when coadministered with IV methotrexate 2 g/m 2 , and by 93% when coadministered with IV methotrexate 5 g/m 2 . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics Several published studies indicate that patients with reduced TPMT or NUDT15 activity receiving usual doses of mercaptopurine, accumulate excessive cellular concentrations of active 6-TGNs, and are at higher risk for severe myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . In a study of 1028 children with ALL, the approximate tolerated mercaptopurine dosage for patients with TPMT and/or NUDT15 deficiency on mercaptopurine maintenance therapy (as a percentage of the planned dosage) was as follows: heterozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15, 50-90%; heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15, 30-50%; homozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15, 5-10%. Approximately 0.3% (1:300) of patients of European or African ancestry have two loss-of-function alleles of the TPMT gene and have little or no TPMT activity (homozygous deficient or poor metabolizers), and approximately 10% of patients have one loss-of-function TPMT allele leading to intermediate TPMT activity (heterozygous deficient or intermediate metabolizers). The TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, and TPMT*3C alleles account for about 95% of individuals with reduced levels of TPMT activity. NUDT15 deficiency is detected in <1% of patients of European or African ancestry. Among patients of East Asian ancestry (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese), 2% have two loss-of-function alleles of the NUDT15 gene, and approximately 21% have one loss-of-function allele. The p.R139C variant of NUDT15 (present on the *2 and *3 alleles) is the most commonly observed, but other less common loss-of-function NUDT15 alleles have been observed. Consider all clinical information when interpreting results from phenotypic testing used to determine the level of thiopurine nucleotides or TPMT activity in erythrocytes, since some coadministered drugs can influence measurement of TPMT activity in blood, and blood from recent transfusions will misrepresent a patient\u2019s actual TPMT activity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended starting dosage of MERCAPTOPURINE is 1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg (50 mg/m 2 to 75 mg/m 2 ) orally once daily as part of a combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen. Adjust dose to maintain desirable absolute neutrophil count and for excessive myelosuppression.( 2.1 ) Renal Impairment : Use the lowest recommended starting dose or increase the dosing interval. ( 2.3, 8.6 ) Hepatic Impairment : Use the lowest recommended starting dose. ( 2.3, 8.7 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose of MERCAPTOPURINE is 1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg (50 mg/m 2 to 75 mg/m 2 ) orally once daily as part of combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen. Take MERCAPTOPURINE either consistently with or without food. After initiating MERCAPTOPURINE, monitor complete blood counts (CBC) and adjust the dose to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for excessive myelosuppression. Evaluate the bone marrow in patients with prolonged myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression to assess leukemia status and marrow cellularity. Evaluate thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) status in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. If a patient misses a dose, instruct the patient to continue with the next scheduled dose. 2.2 Dosage Modifications in Patients with TPMT and/or NUDT15 Deficiency Consider testing for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency in patients who experience severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. Homozygous Deficiency in either TPMT or NUDT15 Patients with homozygous deficiency of either enzyme typically require 10% or less of the recommended dosage. Reduce the recommended starting dosage of MERCAPTOPURINE in patients who are known to have homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency. Heterozygous Deficiency in TPMT and/or NUDT15 Reduce the MERCAPTOPURINE dosage based on tolerability. Most patients with heterozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency tolerate recommended dosage, but some require dose reduction based on adverse reactions. Patients who are heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15 may require more substantial dose reductions. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Renal and Hepatic Impairment Renal Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for MERCAPTOPURINE in patients with renal impairment (CLcr less than 50 mL/min). Adjust the dosage to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Uses in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Hepatic Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for MERCAPTOPURINE in patients with hepatic impairment. Adjust the dosage to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Uses in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 2.4 Dosage Modification with Concomitant Use of Allopurinol Reduce the dose of MERCAPTOPURINE to one-third to one-quarter of the current dosage when coadministered with allopurinol [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 2.5 Administration Shake the bottle vigorously for at least 30 seconds to ensure the oral suspension is well mixed. MERCAPTOPURINE is a pink to brown viscous oral suspension. Provide a press-in bottle adapter and two oral dispensing syringes (one 1 mL and one 5 mL). Train patients or caregivers on proper handling, storage, administration, disposal and clean-up of accidental spillage prior to initiation of MERCAPTOPURINE and during each visit to the clinic. Advise patients and caregivers to use MERCAPTOPURINE within 8 weeks and properly discard remaining MERCAPTOPURINE after 8 weeks. Provide instructions regarding which syringe to use and how to administer the specified dose, since MERCAPTOPURINE is supplied with 1 mL and 5 mL oral dispensing syringes. Advise patients that the oral dispensing syringe is intended for multiple uses and provide the following instructions: Wash the oral dispensing syringe with warm \u2018soapy\u2019 water and rinse well; Hold the oral dispensing syringe under water and move the plunger up and down several times to make sure the inside of the oral dispensing syringe is clean; Ensure the oral dispensing syringe is completely dry before use of the oral dispensing syringe again; and Store the oral dispensing syringe in a hygienic place with MERCAPTOPURINE. MERCAPTOPURINE is a hazardous drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Oral suspension: 2,000 mg/100 mL (20 mg/mL). ( 3 ) Oral Suspension: 2,000 mg/100 mL (20 mg/mL) pink to brown in color. 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None None. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myelosuppression : Monitor complete blood count (CBC) and adjust the dose of MERCAPTOPURINE for excessive myelosuppression. Consider testing in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency. Patients with homozygous-TPMT or homozygous-NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction. ( 2.2, 5.1 ) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. Withhold MERCAPTOPURINE at onset of hepatotoxicity. ( 5.2 ) Immunosuppression :Response to all vaccines may be diminished and there is a risk of infection with live virus vaccines. Consult immunization guidelines for immunocompromised pediatrics. ( 5.3 ) Treatment Related Malignancies : Aggressive and fatal cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have occurred. ( 5.4 ) Macrophage Activation Syndrome : Monitor for and treat promptly; discontinue MERCAPTOPURINE. ( 5.5 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.6 , 8.1, 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression The most consistent, dose-related adverse reaction of MERCAPTOPURINE is myelosuppression, manifested by anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or any combination of these. Monitor CBC and adjust the dosage of MERCAPTOPURINE for excessive myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Consider testing for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) and NUDT15 genotyping can identify patients who have reduced activity of these enzymes. Patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction, [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. Myelosuppression can be exacerbated by coadministration with allopurinol, aminosalicylates or other products that cause myelosuppression. [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.3 , 7.4) ]. Reduce the dosage of MERCAPTOPURINE when coadministered with allopurinol [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Mercaptopurine is hepatotoxic. There are reports of deaths attributed to hepatic necrosis associated with the administration of mercaptopurine. Hepatic injury can occur with any dosage but seems to occur with greater frequency when the recommended dosage is exceeded. In some patients, jaundice has cleared following withdrawal of mercaptopurine and reappeared with rechallenge. Usually, clinically detectable jaundice appears early in the course of treatment (1 to 2 months); however, jaundice has been reported as early as 1 week and as late as 8 years after starting mercaptopurine. The hepatotoxicity has been associated in some cases with anorexia, diarrhea, jaundice, ascites and pruritus. Hepatic encephalopathy has occurred. Monitor serum transaminase levels, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels at weekly intervals when first beginning therapy and at monthly intervals thereafter. Monitor liver tests more frequently in patients who are receiving MERCAPTOPURINE with other hepatotoxic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] or with known pre-existing liver disease. Withhold MERCAPTOPURINE at onset of hepatotoxicity. Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy Postmarketing cases of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) have been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who received mercaptopurine during pregnancy. MERCAPTOPURINE is not indicated for use in inflammatory bowel disease [see Indications and Usage (1.1) ]. Discontinue MERCAPTOPURINE if ICP develops in a pregnant woman. 5.3 Immunosuppression Mercaptopurine is immunosuppressive and may impair the immune response to infectious agents or vaccines. Due to the immunosuppression associated with maintenance chemotherapy for ALL, response to all vaccines may be diminished and there is a risk of infection with live virus vaccines. Consult immunization guidelines for immunocompromised patients. 5.4 Treatment Related Malignancies Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been reported in patients treated with mercaptopurine for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), an unapproved use. Mercaptopurine is mutagenic in animals and humans, carcinogenic in animals, and may increase the risk of secondary malignancies. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including mercaptopurine, are at an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders and other malignancies, notably skin cancers (melanoma and non-melanoma), sarcomas (Kaposi's and non-Kaposi's) and uterine cervical cancer in situ. The increased risk appears to be related to the degree and duration of immunosuppression. It has been reported that discontinuation of immunosuppression may provide partial regression of the lymphoproliferative disorder. A treatment regimen containing multiple immunosuppressants (including thiopurines) should therefore be used with caution as this could lead to lymphoproliferative disorders, some with reported fatalities. A combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. 5.5 Macrophage Activation Syndrome Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in patients with autoimmune conditions, in particular with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and there could potentially be an increased susceptibility for developing the condition with the use of mercaptopurine (an unapproved use). If MAS occurs, or is suspected, discontinue MERCAPTOPURINE. Monitor for and promptly treat infections such as EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV), as these are known triggers for MAS. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity MERCAPTOPURINE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. An increased incidence of miscarriage has been reported in women who received mercaptopurine in the first trimester of pregnancy. Adverse embryo-fetal findings, including miscarriage and stillbirth, have been reported in women who received mercaptopurine after the first trimester of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MERCAPTOPURINE and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MERCAPTOPURINE and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) ]. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction (> 20%) is myelosuppression including anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions occurring in 5% to 20% of patients include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rare Disease Therapeutics, Inc., at 1-844-472-7389 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Treatment Related Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Macrophage Activation Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Based on multicenter cooperative group ALL trials, the most common adverse reaction occurring in > 20% of patients was mylelosuppression including anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions occurring in 5% to 20% of patients included anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise, and rash. Adverse reactions occurring in < 5 % of patients included urticaria, hyperuricemia, oral lesions, elevated transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperpigmentation, infections, and pancreatitis. Oral lesions resemble thrush rather than antifolic ulcerations. Delayed or late toxicities include hepatic fibrosis, hyperbilirubinemia, alopecia, pulmonary fibrosis, oligospermia and secondary malignancies. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ]. Drug fever has been reported with MERCAPTOPURINE. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of MERCAPTOPURINE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions include: photosensitivity, hypoglycemia, portal hypertension, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), pellagra, and erythema nodosum. 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Allopurinol : Reduce the dose of MERCAPTOPURINE when co-administered with allopurinol. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) Warfarin : MERCAPTOPURINE may decrease the anticoagulant effect. ( 7.2 ) See FDA approved patient labeling and 7.1 Allopurinol Allopurinol can inhibit the first-pass oxidative metabolism of mercaptopurine by xanthine oxidase, which can lead to an increased risk of mercaptopurine adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Reduce the dose of MERCAPTOPURINE when coadministered with allopurinol [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 7.2 Warfarin The coadministration of MERCAPTOPURINE with warfarin may decrease the anticoagulant effectiveness of warfarin. Monitor the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin and adjust the warfarin dosage as appropriate. 7.3 Myelosuppressive Products MERCAPTOPURINE can cause myelosuppression. Myelosuppression may be increased when MERCAPTOPURINE is coadministered with other drugs that cause myelosuppression. Enhanced myelosuppression has been noted in some patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Monitor the CBC and adjust the dose of MERCAPTOPURINE for excessive myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.4 Aminosalicylates Aminosalicylates (e.g., mesalamine, olsalazine or sulfasalazine) may inhibit the TPMT enzyme, which may increase the risk of myelosuppression when coadministered with MERCAPTOPURINE. When aminosalicylates and MERCAPTOPURINE are coadministered, use the lowest possible doses for each drug and monitor more frequently for myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.5 Hepatotoxic Products MERCAPTOPURINE can cause hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity may be increased when MERCAPTOPURINE is coadministered with other products that cause hepatotoxicity. Monitor liver tests more frequently in patients who are receiving MERCAPTOPURINE with other hepatotoxic products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 7.6 Methotrexate MERCAPTOPURINE dosage may need adjustment when administered concomitantly with high dose methotrexate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Mercaptopurine exposure increases with concomitant methotrexate use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may increase the risk of MERCAPTOPURINE adverse reactions. The mechanism of this interaction has not been fully characterized [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. (8.2) Infertility : Can impair fertility. (8.3) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary MERCAPTOPURINE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Pregnant women who receive mercaptopurine have an increased incidence of miscarriage and stillbirth ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Women receiving mercaptopurine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased incidence of miscarriage; the risk of malformation in offspring surviving first trimester exposure is not known. In a series of 28 women receiving mercaptopurine after the first trimester of pregnancy, 3 mothers died prior to delivery, 1 delivered a stillborn child, and 1 aborted; there were no cases of macroscopically abnormal fetuses. Animal Data Mercaptopurine was embryo-lethal and teratogenic in several animal species (rat, mouse, rabbit, and hamster) at doses less than the recommended human dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of mercaptopurine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with MERCAPTOPURINE and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential MERCAPTOPURINE can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating MERCAPTOPURINE [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MERCAPTOPURINE and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MERCAPTOPURINE and for 3 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Infertility Females and Males Based on findings from animal studies, MERCAPTOPURINE can impair female and male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. The long-term effects of mercaptopurine on female and male fertility, including the reversibility have not been studied. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of MERCAPTOPURINE has been established in pediatric patients. Use of MERCAPTOPURINE in pediatrics is supported by evidence from the published literature and clinical experience. Symptomatic hypoglycemia has been reported in pediatric patients with ALL receiving mercaptopurine. Reported cases were in pediatrics less than 6 years or with a low body mass index. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mercaptopurine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or another drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for MERCAPTOPURINE or increase the dosing interval to every 36 to 48 hours in patients with renal impairment (CLcr less than 50 mL/min). Adjust the dose to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for MERCAPTOPURINE in patients with hepatic impairment. Adjust the dose to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]."

Dialysis cannot be expected to clear mercaptopurine. Hemodialysis is thought to be of marginal use due to the rapid intracellular incorporation of mercaptopurine into active metabolites with long persistence. Withhold MERCAPTOPURINE immediately if severe or life-threatening adverse reactions occur during treatment. If a patient is seen immediately following an accidental overdosage, it may be useful to induce emesis."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mercaptopurine is a purine analog that undergoes intracellular transport and activation to form metabolites including thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs). Incorporation of TGNs into DNA or RNA results in cell-cycle arrest and cell death. TGNs and other mercaptopurine metabolites are also inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis and purine nucleotide interconversions. Mercaptopurine was cytotoxic to proliferating cancer cells in vitro and had antitumor activity in mouse tumor models. It is not known which of the biochemical effects of mercaptopurine and its metabolites are directly or predominantly responsible for cell death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationships Mercaptopurine exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following a single oral dose of MERCAPTOPURINE 50 mg under fasted conditions to adult healthy subjects, the median (min \u2013 max) AUC 0-INF was 137 h\u2219ng/mL (77 \u2013 268 h\u2219ng/mL) and C max was 93 ng/mL (40 \u2013 204 ng/mL). Absorption MERCAPTOPURINE is absorbed after oral administration with a median (min \u2013 max) T max of 0.75 (0.33 \u2013 2.5) hours. Effect of foods Food has been shown to decrease the exposure of mercaptopurine. Distribution The volume of distribution exceeds total body water with a mean volume of distribution of approximately 0.9 L/kg. There is negligible entry of mercaptopurine into cerebrospinal fluid. Plasma protein binding averages 19% over the concentration range 10 to 50 mcg/L. Elimination The median (min \u2013 max) elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) was 1.3 (0.9 \u2013 5.4) hours. Metabolism Mercaptopurine is inactivated via two major pathways. One is thiol methylation, which is catalyzed by the polymorphic enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), to form the inactive metabolite methyl-mercaptopurine. The second inactivation pathway is oxidation, which is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase. The product of oxidation is the inactive metabolite 6-thiouric acid. Elimination After oral administration of mercaptopurine, urine contains intact mercaptopurine, thiouric acid (formed by direct oxidation by xanthine oxidase, probably via 6-mercapto-8-hydroxypurine), and a number of 6-methylated thiopurines. In one subject, a total of 46% of the dose could be accounted for in the urine (as parent drug and metabolites) in the first 24 hours. Specific Populations Pediatrics Patients Wide inter individual variations in systemic exposure is observed. Following oral administration of 50 mg/m 2 mercaptopurine in 10 children, median plasma concentrations 1 hour post dose was 0.35 (range 0.03 to 1.03) \u03bcM and median AUC1 \u20135hours was 56 (range 23 to 65) \u03bcM\u00b7min. Tmax ranged from 1 to 3 hours. Drug Interactions Studies Methotrexate: Mercaptopurine AUC increased by approximately 31% when coadministered with oral methotrexate 20 mg/m 2 . Mercaptopurine AUC increased by 69% when coadministered with IV methotrexate 2 g/m 2 , and by 93% when coadministered with IV methotrexate 5 g/m 2 . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics Several published studies indicate that patients with reduced TPMT or NUDT15 activity receiving usual doses of mercaptopurine, accumulate excessive cellular concentrations of active 6-TGNs, and are at higher risk for severe myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. In a study of 1028 children with ALL, the approximate tolerated mercaptopurine dosage for patients with TPMT and/or NUDT15 deficiency on mercaptopurine maintenance therapy (as a percentage of the planned dosage) was as follows: heterozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15, 50-90%; heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15, 30-50%; homozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15, 5-10%. Approximately 0.3% (1:300) of patients of European or African ancestry have two loss-of-function alleles of the TPMT gene and have little or no TPMT activity (homozygous deficient or poor metabolizers), and approximately 10% of patients have one loss-of-function TPMT allele leading to intermediate TPMT activity (heterozygous deficient or intermediate metabolizers). The TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, and TPMT*3C alleles account for about 95% of individuals with reduced levels of TPMT activity. NUDT15 deficiency is detected in <1% of patients of European or African ancestry. Among patients of East Asian ancestry (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese), 2% have two loss-of-function alleles of the NUDT15 gene, and approximately 21% have one loss-of-function allele. The p.R139C variant of NUDT15 (present on the *2 and *3 alleles) is the most commonly observed, but other less common loss-of-function NUDT15 alleles have been observed. Consider all clinical information when interpreting results from phenotypic testing used to determine the level of thiopurine nucleotides or TPMT activity in erythrocytes, since some coadministered drugs can influence measurement of TPMT activity in blood, and blood from recent transfusions will misrepresent a patient\u2019s actual TPMT activity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

Figure D Figure E 8. Turn the bottle upside down (See Figure F ). Figure F 9. Pull back slowly on the plunger of the oral dispensing syringe to withdraw the prescribed dose of MERCAPTOPURINE. Pull the plunger back to the mL mark of the syringe that corresponds to the dose prescribed ( Figure F ). If you are not sure about how much medicine to draw into the oral dispensing syringe, always ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice. 10. Leave the oral dispensing syringe in the bottle adapter and turn the bottle right-side up. Place the bottle onto a flat surface. Hold the oral dispensing syringe by the barrel and carefully remove it from the adapter. Do not hold the oral dispensing syringe by the plunger, because the plunger may come out. 11. Place the tip of the oral dispensing syringe in your mouth and aim the tip toward the inside of your cheek. 12. Gently squirt the MERCAPTOPURINE oral suspension into your mouth by pushing on the plunger until the oral dispensing syringe is empty. Swallow the medicine. Do not forcefully push on the plunger. Do not squirt the medicine to the back of your mouth or throat. This may cause you to choke. 13. Remove the oral dispensing syringe from your mouth. 14. Swallow the dose of oral suspension then drink some water, making sure no medicine is left in your mouth. 15. Put the cap back on the bottle with the adapter left in place. Close the cap tightly. 16. Wash the oral dispensing syringe with warm soapy water and rinse well. Hold the oral dispensing syringe under water and move the plunger up and down several times to make sure the inside of the oral dispensing syringe is clean. Let the oral dispensing syringe dry completely before you use it again for dosing. Do not throw away the oral dispensing syringe after use. Ingredients in MERCAPTOPURINE Active ingredient: mercaptopurine Inactive ingredients: xanthan gum, aspartame, concentrated raspberry juice, sucrose, ethyl parahydroxybenzoate sodium, methyl parahydroxybenzoate sodium, potassium sorbate, sodium hydroxide and purified water. Storing MERCAPTOPURINE Store MERCAPTOPURINE between 59\u00baF to 77\u00baF (15\u00baC to 25\u00baC), in a dry place. Do not store above 25\u00b0C. Store the oral dispensing syringe in a clean place, with the medicine. MERCAPTOPURINE oral suspension should be used within 8 weeks after opening the bottle. Dispose of (throw away) any unused medicine after 8 weeks. Do not use after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and the bottle after \u2018EXP\u2019. Keep the bottle tightly closed to prevent spoilage of the medicine and reduce the risk of accidental spillage. Keep MERCAPTOPURINE oral suspension and all medicines out of the reach of children, preferably in a locked cupboard. If a child accidentally takes MERCAPTOPURINE, it could cause death. Ask your pharmacist how to dispose of (throw away) MERCAPTOPURINE that is no longer needed. Disposing of MERCAPTOPURINE Ask your pharmacist how to dispose of MERCAPTOPURINE that is expired or no longer required. Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Clean Up Spillage of MERCAPTOPURINE Use appropriate personal protective equipment (disposable gloves and eye protection). Mop up and contain spill material in a compatible container. Wash your hands thoroughly afterwards. MERCAPTOPURINE contact with Skin, Eyes, or Clothes Remove and launder contaminated clothing. Wash skin or eyes immediately with water. Contact with skin or eyes can cause hypersensitive reactions resulting in rash, redness, itching and inflammation. If symptoms appear, seek medical attention.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 The recommended starting dose of Mercaptopurine Tablets is 1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg orally once daily as part of a combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen. Adjust dose to maintain desirable absolute neutrophil count and for excessive myelosuppression. (2.1) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Use the lowest recommended starting dose or increase the dosing interval. (2.3, 8.6) \u2022 Hepatic Impairment: Use the lowest recommended starting dose. (2.3, 8.7) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dosage of Mercaptopurine Tablets is 1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg orally once daily as part of combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen. A recommended dosage for patients less than 17 kg is not achievable, because the only available strength is 50 mg. Take Mercaptopurine Tablets either consistently with or without food. After initiating Mercaptopurine Tablets, monitor complete blood count (CBC) and adjust the dose to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for excessive myelosuppression. Evaluate the bone marrow in patients with prolonged myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression to assess leukemia status and marrow cellularity. Evaluate thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) status in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes or myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 )]. Do not administer to patients who are unable to swallow tablets. If a patient misses a dose, instruct the patient to continue with the next scheduled dose. Mercaptopurine Tablets is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 2.2 Dosage Modifications in Patients with TPMT and NUDT15 Deficiency Consider testing for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency in patients who experience severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )]. Homozygous Deficiency in either TPMT or NUDT15 Patients with homozygous deficiency of either enzyme typically require 10% or less of the recommended dosage. Reduce the recommended starting dosage of Mercaptopurine Tablets in patients who are known to have homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency. Heterozygous Deficiency in TPMT and/or NUDT15 Reduce the Mercaptopurine Tablets dose based on tolerability. Most patients with heterozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency tolerate the recommended dosage, but some require a dose reduction based on adverse reactions. Patients who are heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15 may require more substantial dose reductions. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Renal and Hepatic Impairment Renal Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for Mercaptopurine Tablets in patients with renal impairment (CLcr less than 50 mL/min). Adjust the dosage to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Hepatic Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for Mercaptopurine Tablets in patients with hepatic impairment. Adjust the dosage to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Uses in Specific Populations (8.7 )]. 2.4 Dosage Modification with Concomitant Use of Allopurinol Reduce the dose of Mercaptopurine Tablets to one-third to one-quarter of the current dosage when coadministered with allopurinol [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myelosuppression: Monitor complete blood count (CBC) and adjust the dose of Mercaptopurine Tablets for excessive myelosuppression. Consider testing in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency. Patients with homozygous or homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction. (2.2, 5.1) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. Withhold Mercaptopurine Tablets at onset of hepatotoxicity. (5.2) \u2022 Immunosuppression: Response to all vaccines may be diminished and there is a risk of infection with live virus vaccines. Consult immunization guidelines for immunocompromised patients. (5.3) \u2022 Treatment Related Malignancies: Aggressive and fatal cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have occurred. (5.4) \u2022 Macrophage Activation Syndrome: Monitor for and treat promptly; discontinue Mercaptopurine Tablets. (5.5) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.6, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Myelosuppression The most consistent, dose-related adverse reaction is myelosuppression, manifested by anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or any combination of these. Monitor CBC and adjust the dosage of Mercaptopurine Tablets for excessive myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Consider testing for TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) and NUDT15 genotyping can identify patients who have reduced activity of these enzymes. Patients with heterozygous or homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )]. Myelosuppression can be exacerbated by coadministration with allopurinol, aminosalicylates or other products that cause myelosuppression [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.3 , 7.4 )]. Reduce the dose of Mercaptopurine Tablets when coadministered with allopurinol [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 )] . 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Mercaptopurine is hepatotoxic. There are reports of deaths attributed to hepatic necrosis associated with the administration of mercaptopurine. Hepatic injury can occur with any dosage but seems to occur with greater frequency when the recommended dosage is exceeded. In some patients, jaundice has cleared following withdrawal of mercaptopurine and reappeared with rechallenge. Usually, clinically detectable jaundice appears early in the course of treatment (1 to 2 months); however, jaundice has been reported as early as 1 week and as late as 8 years after the starting mercaptopurine. The hepatotoxicity has been associated in some cases with anorexia, diarrhea, jaundice, ascites, and pruritus . Hepatic encephalopathy has occurred. Monitor serum transaminase levels, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels at weekly intervals when first beginning therapy and at monthly intervals thereafter. Monitor liver tests more frequently in patients who are receiving Mercaptopurine Tablets with other hepatotoxic products [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] or with known pre-existing liver disease. Withhold Mercaptopurine Tablets at onset of hepatotoxicity. Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy Postmarketing cases of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) have been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who received mercaptopurine during pregnancy. Mercaptopurine Tablets are not indicated for use in inflammatory bowel disease [see Indications and Usage ( 1.1 )]. Discontinue Mercaptopurine Tablets if ICP develops in a pregnant woman. 5.3 Immunosuppression Mercaptopurine is immunosuppressive and may impair the immune response to infectious agents or vaccines. Due to the immunosuppression associated with maintenance chemotherapy for ALL, response to all vaccines may be diminished and there is a risk of infection with live virus vaccines. Consult immunization guidelines for immunocompromised patients. 5.4 Treatment Related Malignancies Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been reported in patients treated with mercaptopurine for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), an unapproved use. Mercaptopurine is mutagenic in animals and humans, carcinogenic in animals, and may increase the risk of secondary malignancies. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including mercaptopurine, are at an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders and other malignancies, notably skin cancers (melanoma and non-melanoma), sarcomas (Kaposi's and non-Kaposi's) and uterine cervical cancer in situ. The increased risk appears to be related to the degree and duration of immunosuppression. It has been reported that discontinuation of immunosuppression may provide partial regression of the lymphoproliferative disorder. A treatment regimen containing multiple immunosuppressants (including thiopurines) should therefore be used with caution as this could lead to lymphoproliferative disorders, some with reported fatalities. A combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. 5.5 Macrophage Activation Syndrome Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in patients with autoimmune conditions, in particular with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and there could potentially be an increased susceptibility for developing the condition with the use of mercaptopurine (an unapproved use). If MAS occurs, or is suspected, discontinue Mercaptopurine Tablets. Monitor for and promptly treat infections such as EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV), as these are known triggers for MAS. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Mercaptopurine Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. An increased incidence of miscarriage has been reported in women who received mercaptopurine in the first trimester of pregnancy. Adverse embryo-fetal findings, including miscarriage and stillbirth, have been reported in women who received mercaptopurine after the first trimester of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Mercaptopurine Tablets and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Mercaptopurine Tablets and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \u2022 Treatment related malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )] \u2022 Macrophage activation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] The most common adverse reaction (>20%) is myelosuppression, including anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions occurring in 5% to 20% of patients include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-800-962-8364 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Based on multicenter cooperative group ALL trials, the most common adverse reaction occurring in > 20% of patients was myelosuppression, including anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions occurring in 5% to 20% of patients included anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise and rash. Adverse reactions occurring in < 5 % of patients included urticaria, hyperuricemia, oral lesions, increased transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperpigmentation, infections, and pancreatitis. Oral lesions resemble thrush rather than antifolic ulcerations. Delayed or late adverse reactions include hepatic fibrosis, hyperbilirubinemia, alopecia, pulmonary fibrosis, oligospermia and secondary malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2 )]. Drug fever has been reported with mercaptopurine. Additional adverse reactions that have been reported in patients who have received mercaptopurine include photosensitivity, hypoglycemia, and portal hypertension. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Mercaptopurine Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions include: intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Allopurinol : Reduce the dose of Mercaptopurine Tablets when co-administered with allopurinol. (2.4, 7.1) \u2022 Warfarin : Mercaptopurine Tablets may decrease the anticoagulant effect. (7.2) 7.1 Allopurinol Allopurinol can inhibit the first-pass oxidative metabolism of mercaptopurine by xanthine oxidase, which can lead to an increased risk of mercaptopurine adverse reactions (i.e., myelosuppression, nausea, and vomiting) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Reduce the dose of Mercaptopurine Tablets when coadministered with allopurinol [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 7.2 Warfarin The concomitant administration of Mercaptopurine Tablets and warfarin may decrease the anticoagulant effectiveness of warfarin. Monitor the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin and adjust the warfarin dosage as appropriate. 7.3 Myelosuppressive Products Mercaptopurine Tablets can cause myelosuppression. Myelosuppression may be increased when Mercaptopurine Tablets are coadministered with other products that cause myelosuppression. Enhanced myelosuppression has been noted in some patients also receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Monitor the CBC and adjust the dose of Mercaptopurine Tablets for excessive myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.4 Aminosalicylates Aminosalicylates (e.g., mesalamine, olsalazine or sulfasalazine) may inhibit the TPMT enzyme, which may increase the risk of myelosuppression when coadministered with Mercaptopurine Tablets. When aminosalicylates and Mercaptopurine Tablets are coadministered, use the lowest possible doses for each drug and monitor more frequently for myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.5 Hepatotoxic Products Mercaptopurine Tablets can cause hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity may be increased when Mercaptopurine Tablets are coadministered with other products that cause hepatotoxicity. Monitor liver tests more frequently in patients who are receiving Mercaptopurine Tablets with other hepatotoxic products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. (8.2) \u2022 Infertility: Can impair fertility. (8.3) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mercaptopurine Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Pregnant women who receive mercaptopurine have an increased incidence of miscarriage and stillbirth (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Women receiving mercaptopurine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased incidence of miscarriage; the risk of malformation in offspring surviving first trimester exposure is not known. In a series of 28 women receiving mercaptopurine after the first trimester of pregnancy, 3 mothers died prior to delivery, 1 delivered a stillborn child, and 1 aborted; there were no cases of macroscopically abnormal fetuses. Animal Data Mercaptopurine was embryo-lethal and teratogenic in several animal species (rat, mouse, rabbit, and hamster) at doses less than the recommended human dose . 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of mercaptopurine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Mercaptopurine Tablets and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Mercaptopurine Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Mercaptopurine Tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 )]. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Mercaptopurine Tablets and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Mercaptopurine Tablets and for 3 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Infertility Females and Males Based on findings from animal studies, Mercaptopurine Tablets can impair female and male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. The long-term effects of mercaptopurine on female and male fertility, including the reversibility have not been studied. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Mercaptopurine Tablets have been established in pediatric patients. Use of Mercaptopurine Tablets in pediatrics is supported by evidence from the published literature and clinical experience. Symptomatic hypoglycemia has been reported in pediatric patients with ALL receiving mercaptopurine. Reported cases were in pediatrics less than 6 years of age or with a low body mass index. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mercaptopurine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or another drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for Mercaptopurine Tablets or increase the dosing interval to every 36 to 48 hours in patients with renal impairment (CLcr less than 50 mL/min). Adjust the dose to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for Mercaptopurine Tablets in patients with hepatic impairment.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mercaptopurine Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Pregnant women who receive mercaptopurine have an increased incidence of miscarriage and stillbirth (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Women receiving mercaptopurine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased incidence of miscarriage; the risk of malformation in offspring surviving first trimester exposure is not known. In a series of 28 women receiving mercaptopurine after the first trimester of pregnancy, 3 mothers died prior to delivery, 1 delivered a stillborn child, and 1 aborted; there were no cases of macroscopically abnormal fetuses. Animal Data Mercaptopurine was embryo-lethal and teratogenic in several animal species (rat, mouse, rabbit, and hamster) at doses less than the recommended human dose ."

Dialysis cannot be expected to clear mercaptopurine. Hemodialysis is thought to be of marginal use due to the rapid intracellular incorporation of mercaptopurine into active metabolites with long persistence.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mercaptopurine is a purine analog that undergoes intracellular transport and activation to form metabolites including thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs). Incorporation of TGNs into DNA or RNA results in cell-cycle arrest and cell death. TGNs and other mercaptopurine metabolites are also inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis and purine nucleotide interconversions. Mercaptopurine was cytotoxic to proliferating cancer cells in vitro and had antitumor activity in mouse tumor models. It is not known which of the biochemical effects of mercaptopurine and its metabolites are directly or predominantly responsible for cell death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationships Mercaptopurine exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following a single oral dose of mercaptopurine 50 mg under fasted conditions to adult healthy subjects, the mean AUC 0-INF was 129 h \u00b7 ng/mL and C max was 69 ng/mL. Absorption Food Effect Food has been shown to decrease the exposure of mercaptopurine. Distribution The volume of distribution usually exceeded that of the total body water. There is negligible entry of mercaptopurine into cerebrospinal fluid. Plasma protein binding averages 19% over the concentration range 10 to 50 mcg/mL (a concentration only achieved by intravenous administration of mercaptopurine at doses exceeding 5 to 10 mg/kg). Elimination The elimination half-life is less than 2 hours following a single oral dose. Metabolism Mercaptopurine is inactivated via two major pathways. One is thiol methylation, which is catalyzed by the polymorphic enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), to form the inactive metabolite methyl-mercaptopurine. The second inactivation pathway is oxidation, which is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase. The product of oxidation is the inactive metabolite 6-thiouric acid. Excretion Following the oral administration of radiolabeled mercaptopurine, 46% of the dose was recovered in the urine (as parent drug and metabolites) in the first 24 hours. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics Several published studies indicate that patients with reduced TPMT or NUDT15 activity receiving usual doses of mercaptopurine, accumulate excessive cellular concentrations of active 6-TGNs, and are at higher risk for severe myelosuppression. In a study of 1028 children with ALL, the approximate tolerated mercaptopurine dosage for patients with TPMT and/or NUDT15 deficiency on mercaptopurine maintenance therapy (as a percentage of the planned dosage) was as follows: heterozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15, 50 to 90%; heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15, 30 to 50%; homozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15, 5 to 10%. Approximately 0.3% (1:300) of patients of European or African ancestry have two loss-of-function alleles of the TPMT gene and have little or no TPMT activity (homozygous deficient or poor metabolizers), and approximately 10% of patients have one loss-of-function TPMT allele leading to intermediate TPMT activity (heterozygous deficient or intermediate metabolizers). The TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, and TPMT*3C alleles account for about 95% of individuals with reduced levels of TPMT activity. NUDT15 deficiency is detected in <1% of patients of European or African ancestry. Among patients of East Asian ancestry (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese), 2% have two loss-of-function alleles of the NUDT15 gene, and approximately 21% have one loss-of-function allele. The p.R139C variant of NUDT15 (present on the *2 and *3 alleles) is the most commonly observed, but other less common loss-of-function NUDT15 alleles have been observed. Consider all clinical information when interpreting results from phenotypic testing used to determine the level of thiopurine nucleotides or TPMT activity in erythrocytes, since some coadministered drugs can influence measurement of TPMT activity in blood and blood from recent transfusions will misrepresent a patient\u2019s actual TPMT activity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION The recommended starting dose of mercaptopurine tablets is 1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg orally once daily as part of a combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen. Adjust dose to maintain desirable absolute neutrophil count and for excessive myelosuppression. (2.1) Renal Impairment : Use the lowest recommended starting dose or increase the dosing interval. (2.3, 8.6) Hepatic Impairment : Use the lowest recommended starting dose. (2.3, 8.7) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dosage of mercaptopurine tablets is 1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg orally once daily as part of combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen. A recommended dosage for patients less than 17 kg is not achievable, because the only available strength is 50 mg. Take mercaptopurine tablets either consistently with or without food. After initiating mercaptopurine tablets, monitor complete blood count (CBC) and adjust the dose to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for excessive myelosuppression. Evaluate the bone marrow in patients with prolonged myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression to assess leukemia status and marrow cellularity. Evaluate thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) status in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes or myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Do not administer to patients who are unable to swallow tablets. If a patient misses a dose, instruct the patient to continue with the next scheduled dose. Mercaptopurine tablets is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 2.2 Dosage Modifications in Patients with TPMT and NUDT15 Deficiency Consider testing for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency in patients who experience severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . Homozygous Deficiency in either TPMT or NUDT15 Patients with homozygous deficiency of either enzyme typically require 10% or less of the recommended dosage. Reduce the recommended starting dosage of mercaptopurine tablets in patients who are known to have homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency. Heterozygous Deficiency in TPMT and/or NUDT15 Reduce the mercaptopurine tablets dose based on tolerability. Most patients with heterozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency tolerate the recommended dosage, but some require a dose reduction based on adverse reactions. Patients who are heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15 may require more substantial dose reductions. 2.3 Dosage Modifications in Renal and Hepatic Impairment Renal Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for mercaptopurine tablets in patients with renal impairment (CLcr less than 50 mL/min). Adjust the dosage to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Uses in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Hepatic Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for mercaptopurine tablets in patients with hepatic impairment. Adjust the dosage to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Uses in Specific Populations (8.7)] . 2.4 Dosage Modification with Concomitant Use of Allopurinol Reduce the dose of mercaptopurine tablets to one-third to one-quarter of the current dosage when coadministered with allopurinol [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myelosuppression : Monitor complete blood count (CBC) and adjust the dose of mercaptopurine tablets for excessive myelosuppression. Consider testing in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression for thiopurine S -methyltransferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency. Patients with homozygous or homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction. (2.2, 5.1) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. Withhold mercaptopurine tablets at onset of hepatotoxicity. (5.2) Immunosuppression : Response to all vaccines may be diminished and there is a risk of infection with live virus vaccines. Consult immunization guidelines for immunocompromised patients. (5.3) Treatment Related Malignancies : Aggressive and fatal cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have occurred. (5.4) Macrophage Activation Syndrome : Monitor for and treat promptly; discontinue mercaptopurine tablets. (5.5) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.6, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Myelosuppression The most consistent, dose-related adverse reaction is myelosuppression, manifested by anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or any combination of these. Monitor CBC and adjust the dosage of mercaptopurine tablets for excessive myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Consider testing for TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) and NUDT15 genotyping can identify patients who have reduced activity of these enzymes. Patients with heterozygous or homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . Myelosuppression can be exacerbated by coadministration with allopurinol, aminosalicylates or other products that cause myelosuppression [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.3, 7.4)]. Reduce the dose of mercaptopurine tablets when coadministered with allopurinol [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.2 Hepatoxicity Mercaptopurine is hepatotoxic. There are reports of deaths attributed to hepatic necrosis associated with the administration of mercaptopurine. Hepatic injury can occur with any dosage but seems to occur with greater frequency when the recommended dosage is exceeded. In some patients, jaundice has cleared following withdrawal of mercaptopurine and reappeared with rechallenge. Usually, clinically detectable jaundice appears early in the course of treatment (1 to 2 months); however, jaundice has been reported as early as 1 week and as late as 8 years after the starting mercaptopurine. The hepatotoxicity has been associated in some cases with anorexia, diarrhea, jaundice, ascites, and pruritus. Hepatic encephalopathy has occurred. Monitor serum transaminase levels, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels at weekly intervals when first beginning therapy and at monthly intervals thereafter. Monitor liver tests more frequently in patients who are receiving mercaptopurine tablets with other hepatotoxic products [see Drug Interactions (7.5)] or with known pre-existing liver disease. Withhold mercaptopurine tablets at onset of hepatotoxicity. Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy Postmarketing cases of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) have been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who received mercaptopurine during pregnancy. Mercaptopurine is not indicated for use in inflammatory bowel disease [see Indications and Usage (1.1)] . Discontinue Mercaptopurine if ICP develops in a pregnant woman. 5.3 Immunosuppression Mercaptopurine is immunosuppressive and may impair the immune response to infectious agents or vaccines. Due to the immunosuppression associated with maintenance chemotherapy for ALL, response to all vaccines may be diminished and there is a risk of infection with live virus vaccines. Consult immunization guidelines for immunocompromised patients. 5.4 Treatment Related Malignancies Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been reported in patients treated with mercaptopurine for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), an unapproved use. Mercaptopurine is mutagenic in animals and humans, carcinogenic in animals, and may increase the risk of secondary malignancies. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including mercaptopurine, are at an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders and other malignancies, notably skin cancers (melanoma and non-melanoma), sarcomas (Kaposi's and non-Kaposi's) and uterine cervical cancer in situ. The increased risk appears to be related to the degree and duration of immunosuppression. It has been reported that discontinuation of immunosuppression may provide partial regression of the lymphoproliferative disorder. A treatment regimen containing multiple immunosuppressants (including thiopurines) should therefore be used with caution as this could lead to lymphoproliferative disorders, some with reported fatalities. A combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. 5.5 Macrophage Activation Syndrome Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in patients with autoimmune conditions, in particular with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and there could potentially be an increased susceptibility for developing the condition with the use of mercaptopurine (an unapproved use). If MAS occurs, or is suspected, discontinue mercaptopurine tablets. Monitor for and promptly treat infections such as EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV), as these are known triggers for MAS. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Mercaptopurine tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. An increased incidence of miscarriage has been reported in women who received mercaptopurine in the first trimester of pregnancy. Adverse embryo-fetal findings, including miscarriage and stillbirth, have been reported in women who received mercaptopurine after the first trimester of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine tablets and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine tablets and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Treatment related malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Macrophage activation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] The most common adverse reaction (>20%) is myelosuppression, including anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions occurring in 5% to 20% of patients include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise and rash. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Florida Pharmaceutical Products, LLC at 1-800-315-0985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Based on multicenter cooperative group ALL trials, the most common adverse reaction occurring in > 20% of patients was myelosuppression, including anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions occurring in 5% to 20% of patients included anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise and rash. Adverse reactions occurring in < 5 % of patients included urticaria, hyperuricemia, oral lesions, increased transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperpigmentation, infections, and pancreatitis. Oral lesions resemble thrush rather than antifolic ulcerations. Delayed or late adverse reactions include hepatic fibrosis, hyperbilirubinemia, alopecia, pulmonary fibrosis, oligospermia and secondary malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Drug fever has been reported with mercaptopurine. Additional adverse reactions that have been reported in patients who have received mercaptopurine include photosensitivity, hypoglycemia, and portal hypertension. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of mercaptopurine tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions include: intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Allopurinol : Reduce the dose of mercaptopurine tablets when co-administered with allopurinol. (2.4, 7.1) Warfarin : Mercaptopurine tablets may decrease the anticoagulant effect. (7.2) 7.1 Allopurinol Allopurinol can inhibit the first-pass oxidative metabolism of mercaptopurine by xanthine oxidase, which can lead to an increased risk of mercaptopurine adverse reactions (i.e., myelosuppression, nausea, and vomiting) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Reduce the dose of mercaptopurine tablets when coadministered with allopurinol [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 7.2 Warfarin The concomitant administration of mercaptopurine tablets and warfarin may decrease the anticoagulant effectiveness of warfarin. Monitor the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin and adjust the warfarin dosage as appropriate. 7.3 Myelosuppresive Products Mercaptopurine tablets can cause myelosuppression. Myelosuppression may be increased when mercaptopurine tablets is coadministered with other products that cause myelosuppression. Enhanced myelosuppression has been noted in some patients also receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Monitor the CBC and adjust the dose of mercaptopurine tablets for excessive myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . 7.4 Aminosalicylates Aminosalicylates (e.g., mesalamine, olsalazine or sulfasalazine) may inhibit the TPMT enzyme, which may increase the risk of myelosuppression when coadministered with mercaptopurine tablets. When aminosalicylates and mercaptopurine tablets are coadministered, use the lowest possible doses for each drug and monitor more frequently for myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . 7.5 Hepatotoxic Products Mercaptopurine tablets can cause hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity may be increased when mercaptopurine tablets is coadministered with other products that cause hepatotoxicity. Monitor liver tests more frequently in patients who are receiving mercaptopurine tablets with other hepatotoxic products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. (8.2) Infertility : Can impair fertility. (8.3) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Mercaptopurine tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] . Pregnant women who receive mercaptopurine have an increased incidence of miscarriage and stillbirth ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Women receiving mercaptopurine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased incidence of miscarriage; the risk of malformation in offspring surviving first trimester exposure is not known. In a series of 28 women receiving mercaptopurine after the first trimester of pregnancy, 3 mothers died prior to delivery, 1 delivered a stillborn child, and 1 aborted; there were no cases of macroscopically abnormal fetuses. Animal Data Mercaptopurine was embryo-lethal and teratogenic in several animal species (rat, mouse, rabbit, and hamster) at doses less than the recommended human dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of mercaptopurine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with mercaptopurine tablets and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Mercaptopurine tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating mercaptopurine tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine tablets and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine tablets and for 3 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . Infertility Females and Males Based on findings from animal studies, mercaptopurine tablets can impair female and male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . The long-term effects of mercaptopurine on female and male fertility, including the reversibility have not been studied. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of mercaptopurine tablets has been established in pediatric patients. Use of mercaptopurine tablets in pediatrics is supported by evidence from the published literature and clinical experience. Symptomatic hypoglycemia has been reported in pediatric patients with ALL receiving mercaptopurine. Reported cases were in pediatrics less than 6 years of age or with a low body mass index. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mercaptopurine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or another drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for mercaptopurine tablets or increase the dosing interval to every 36-48 hours in patients with renal impairment (CLcr less than 50 mL/min). Adjust the dose to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for mercaptopurine tablets in patients with hepatic impairment.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mercaptopurine is a purine analog that undergoes intracellular transport and activation to form metabolites including thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs). Incorporation of TGNs into DNA or RNA results in cell-cycle arrest and cell death. TGNs and other mercaptopurine metabolites are also inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis and purine nucleotide interconversions. Mercaptopurine was cytotoxic to proliferating cancer cells in vitro and had antitumor activity in mouse tumor models. It is not known which of the biochemical effects of mercaptopurine and its metabolites are directly or predominantly responsible for cell death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationships Mercaptopurine exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following a single oral dose of mercaptopurine 50 mg under fasted conditions to adult healthy subjects, the mean AUC 0-INF was 129 h\u00b7ng/mL and C max was 69 ng/mL. Absorption Food Effect Food has been shown to decrease the exposure of mercaptopurine. Distribution The volume of distribution usually exceeded that of the total body water. There is negligible entry of mercaptopurine into cerebrospinal fluid. Plasma protein binding averages 19% over the concentration range 10 to 50 mcg/mL (a concentration only achieved by intravenous administration of mercaptopurine at doses exceeding 5 to 10 mg/kg). Elimination The elimination half-life is less than 2 hours following a single oral dose. Metabolism Mercaptopurine is inactivated via two major pathways. One is thiol methylation, which is catalyzed by the polymorphic enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), to form the inactive metabolite methyl-mercaptopurine. The second inactivation pathway is oxidation, which is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase. The product of oxidation is the inactive metabolite 6-thiouric acid. Excretion Following the oral administration of radiolabeled mercaptopurine, 46% of the dose was recovered in the urine (as parent drug and metabolites) in the first 24 hours. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics Several published studies indicate that patients with reduced TPMT or NUDT15 activity receiving usual doses of mercaptopurine, accumulate excessive cellular concentrations of active 6-TGNs, and are at higher risk for severe myelosuppression. In a study of 1028 children with ALL, the approximate tolerated mercaptopurine dosage for patients with TPMT and/or NUDT15 deficiency on mercaptopurine maintenance therapy (as a percentage of the planned dosage) was as follows: heterozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15, 50-90%; heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15, 30-50%; homozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15, 5-10%. Approximately 0.3% (1:300) of patients of European or African ancestry have two loss-of-function alleles of the TPMT gene and have little or no TPMT activity (homozygous deficient or poor metabolizers), and approximately 10% of patients have one loss-of-function TPMT allele leading to intermediate TPMT activity (heterozygous deficient or intermediate metabolizers). The TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, and TPMT*3C alleles account for about 95% of individuals with reduced levels of TPMT activity. NUDT15 deficiency is detected in <1% of patients of European or African ancestry. Among patients of East Asian ancestry (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese), 2% have two loss-of-function alleles of the NUDT15 gene, and approximately 21% have one loss-of-function allele. The p.R139C variant of NUDT15 (present on the *2 and *3 alleles) is the most commonly observed, but other less common loss-of-function NUDT15 alleles have been observed. Consider all clinical information when interpreting results from phenotypic testing used to determine the level of thiopurine nucleotides or TPMT activity in erythrocytes, since some coadministered drugs can influence measurement of TPMT activity in blood and blood from recent transfusions will misrepresent a patient\u2019s actual TPMT activity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] ."
