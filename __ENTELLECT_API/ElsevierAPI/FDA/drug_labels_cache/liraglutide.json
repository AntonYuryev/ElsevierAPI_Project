    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult Patients: Initiate at 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for one week then increase to 1.2 mg daily. If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dose to 1.8 mg daily after one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg daily dose. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric Patients: Initiate at 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for at least one week. If additional glycemic control is required increase the dose to 1.2 mg daily and if additional glycemic control is still required, increase the dose to 1.8 mg daily after at least one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg daily dose. ( 2.1 ) Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles. ( 2.3 ) Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously once-daily at any time of day, independently of meals, in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. ( 2.3 ) When using liraglutide injection with insulin, administer as separate injections. Never mix. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Adult Patients The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide injection is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for one week. The 0.6 mg once daily dosage is intended to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] during initial titration and is not effective for glycemic control in adults. After one week at the 0.6 mg once daily dosage, increase the dosage to 1.2 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage to the maximum recommended dosage of 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily after at least one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg once daily dosage. Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide injection is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage in 0.6 mg increments after at least one week on the current dosage, to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The maximum recommended dosage is 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. 2.2 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose Instruct patients who miss a dose of liraglutide injection to resume the once -daily dosage regimen as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Do not administer an extra dose or increase the dose to make up for the missed dose. If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last liraglutide injection dose, reinitiate liraglutide injection at 0.6 mg once daily to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with reinitiation of treatment. Upon reinitiation, liraglutide injection should be titrated at the discretion of the healthcare provider. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles. Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously once daily at any time of day, independently of meals. Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. No dosage adjustment is needed if changing the injection site and/or timing. Rotate injection sites within the same region in order to reduce the risk of cutaneous amyloidosis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . When using liraglutide injection with insulin, administer as separate injections. Never mix. It is acceptable to inject liraglutide injection and insulin in the same body region but the injections should not be adjacent to each other."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Pancreatitis : Has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide injection. Discontinue if pancreatitis is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Never Share a liraglutide injection Pen Between Patients, even if the needle is changed. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia : Adult patients taking an insulin secretagogue or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection regardless of insulin and/or metformin use. Reduction in the dose of insulin secretagogues or insulin may be necessary. ( 5.4 ) A cute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion : Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions that could lead to volume depletion. ( 5.5 ) S evere Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions : Use has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe. Liraglutide injection is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis. ( 5.6 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema). Discontinue liraglutide injection and promptly seek medical advice. ( 5.7 ) Acute Gallbladder Disease : If cholelithiasis or cholecystitis are suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. ( 5.8 ) Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation : Has been reported in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers of any planned surgeries or procedures. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether liraglutide injection will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and liraglutide injection use in humans. Liraglutide injection is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of liraglutide injection and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated. 5.2 Acute Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . After initiation of liraglutide injection, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis which may include persistent or severe abdominal pain (sometimes radiating to the back) and which may or may not be accompanied by nausea or vomiting. If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue liraglutide injection and initiate appropriate management. 5.3 Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients Liraglutide injection pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Adult patients receiving liraglutide injection in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection regardless of insulin and/or metformin use. [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications and pediatric patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.5 Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, in some cases requiring hemodialysis, in patients treated with liraglutide injection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . The majority of the reported events occurred in patients who experienced gastrointestinal reactions leading to dehydration such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions to liraglutide injection that could lead to volume depletion, especially during dosage initiation and escalation of liraglutide injection [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.6 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide, has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . In liraglutide injection clinical trials, severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among patients receiving liraglutide injection (1.2 mg 4.4 %, 1.8 mg 4.2 %) than placebo (1.1 %). Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have also been reported postmarketing with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Liraglutide injection is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with liraglutide injection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue liraglutide injection; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with liraglutide injection. Liraglutide injection is contraindicated in patients who have had a serious hypersensitivity reaction to liraglutide or any of the excipients in liraglutide injection [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.8 Acute Gallbladder Disease Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated. 5.9 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation Liraglutide injection delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations. Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking liraglutide injection, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing liraglutide injection could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking liraglutide injection."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information: Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Acute Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Acute Gallbladder Disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655%) in clinical trials are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, dyspepsia, constipation. ( 6.1 ) Immunogenicity-related events, including urticaria, were more common among liraglutide injection-treated patients (0.8%) than among comparator-treated patients (0.4%) in clinical trials. ( 12.6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Common Adverse Reactions The safety of liraglutide injection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled trials in adults and one trial of 52 weeks duration in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . The data in Table 1 reflect exposure of 1,673 adult patients to liraglutide injection and a mean duration of exposure to liraglutide injection of 37.3 weeks. The mean age of adult patients was 58 years, 4% were 75 years or older and 54% were male. The population was 79% White, 6% Black or African American, 13% Asian; 4% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years and a mean HbA 1c of 8.4%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% and moderately impaired in 12% of the pooled population. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions in adults, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of liraglutide injection for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on liraglutide injection than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with liraglutide injection. Overall, the type, and severity of adverse reactions in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older and above were comparable to that observed in the adult population. Table 1: Adverse reactions reported in \u2265 5% of Adult Patients Treated with Liraglutide Injection for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Cumulative proportions were calculated combining studies using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weights.

Other Adverse Reactions Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: In the pool of 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled adult clinical trials, withdrawals due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions, occurred in 4.3% of liraglutide injection-treated patients and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among patients receiving liraglutide injection (1.2 mg 4.4 %, 1.8 mg 4.2 %) than placebo (1.1 %). Withdrawal due to gastrointestinal adverse events mainly occurred during the first 2 to 3 months of the trials. Injection site reactions: Injection site reactions (e.g., injection site rash, erythema) were reported in approximately 2% of liraglutide injection-treated adult patients in the five double-blind, glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration. Less than 0.2% of liraglutide injection-treated patients discontinued due to injection site reactions. Hypoglycemia: In 5 adult glycemic control, placebo-controlled clinical trials of at least 26 weeks duration, hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person for treatment occurred in 8 liraglutide injection-treated patients (7.5 events per 1,000 patient-years). Of these 8 liraglutide injection-treated patients, 7 patients were concomitantly using a sulfonylurea. Table 2: Adult Incidence (%) and Rate (episodes/patient year) of Hypoglycemia in 26-Week Combination Therapy Placebo- controlled Trials \"Patient not able to self-treat\" is defined as an event requiring the assistance of another person for treatment.

No severe hypoglycemic episodes occurred in the liraglutide injection treatment group (severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions). Papillary thyroid carcinoma: In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there were 7 reported cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma in patients treated with liraglutide injection and 1 case in a comparator-treated patient (1.5 vs. 0.5 cases per 1,000 patient- years). Most of these papillary thyroid carcinomas were <1 cm in greatest diameter and were diagnosed in surgical pathology specimens after thyroidectomy prompted by findings on protocol-specified screening with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound. Pancreatitis In glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there have been 13 cases of pancreatitis among liraglutide injection -treated patients and 1 case in a comparator (glimepiride) treated patient (2.7 vs. 0.5 cases per 1,000 patient-years). Nine of the 13 cases with liraglutide injection were reported as acute pancreatitis and four were reported as chronic pancreatitis. In one case in a liraglutide injection-treated patient, pancreatitis, with necrosis, was observed and led to death; however clinical causality could not be established. Some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis: In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, the incidence of cholelithiasis was 0.3% in both liraglutide injection- treated and placebo-treated patients. The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.2% in both liraglutide injection-treated and placebo-treated patients. Laboratory Tests Bilirubin: In the five adult glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration, mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (elevations to no more than twice the upper limit of the reference range) occurred in 4% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 2.1% of placebo-treated patients and 3.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. This finding was not accompanied by abnormalities in other liver tests. The significance of this isolated finding is unknown. Calcitonin: Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program. At the end of the adult glycemic control trials, adjusted mean serum calcitonin concentrations were higher in liraglutide injection-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients but not compared to patients receiving active comparator. Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less. Among adult patients with pretreatment calcitonin <20 ng/L, calcitonin elevations to >20 ng/L occurred in 0.7% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, and 0.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Lipase and Amylase: In one adult glycemic control trial in renal impairment patients, a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed for liraglutide injection-treated patients while placebo-treated patients had a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with liraglutide injection is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Vital signs Liraglutide injection did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed in adult patients treated with liraglutide injection compared to placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of liraglutide injection. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. G astrointestinal: Acute pancreatitis; hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis sometimes resulting in death; ileus, intestinal obstruction, severe constipation including fecal impaction, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea leading to dehydration H epatobiliary: Elevations of liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy, hepatitis Hypersensitivity: Angioedema, anaphylactic reactions, pruritus N eoplasms: Medullary thyroid carcinoma Neurologic: Dysgeusia, dizziness, dysesthesia P ulmonary: Pulmonary aspiration has occurred in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation. Renal : Acute renal failure or worsening of chronic renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis; and increased serum creatinine Skin and subcutaneous tissue: Cutaneous amyloidosis, alopecia"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Effects of delayed gastric emptying on oral medications: Liraglutide injection delays gastric emptying and may impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. ( 7 ) 7.1 Effects of Delayed Gastric Emptying on Oral Medications Liraglutide injection causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials, liraglutide injection did not affect the absorption of the tested orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with liraglutide injection. 7.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin Liraglutide injection stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. Patients receiving liraglutide injection in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia.When initiating liraglutide injection, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Liraglutide injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to liraglutide injection during pregnancy. Liraglutide injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal reproduction studies identified increased adverse developmental outcomes from exposure during pregnancy. Liraglutide exposure was associated with early embryonic deaths and an imbalance in some fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats administered liraglutide during organogenesis at doses that approximate clinical exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.8 mg/day. In pregnant rabbits administered liraglutide during organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of major fetal abnormalities were seen at exposures below the human exposures at the MRHD (see Animal Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects for women with uncontrolled pre-gestational diabetes (Hemoglobin A 1C >7) is 6 to 10%. The major birth defect rate has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a Hemoglobin A 1C >10. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk: Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Animal Data Female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide beginning 2 weeks before mating through gestation day 17 had estimated systemic exposures 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times the human exposure at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. The number of early embryonic deaths in the 1 mg/kg/day group increased slightly. Fetal abnormalities and variations in kidneys and blood vessels, irregular ossification of the skull, and a more complete state of ossification occurred at all doses. Mottled liver and minimally kinked ribs occurred at the highest dose. The incidence of fetal malformations in liraglutide-treated groups exceeding concurrent and historical controls were misshapen oropharynx and/or narrowed opening into larynx at 0.1 mg/kg/day and umbilical hernia at 0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg/day. Pregnant rabbits given subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through day 18 inclusive, had estimated systemic exposures less than the human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day at all doses, based on plasma AUC. Liraglutide decreased fetal weight and dose-dependently increased the incidence of total major fetal abnormalities at all doses. The incidence of malformations exceeded concurrent and historical controls at 0.01 mg/kg/day (kidneys, scapula), \u2265 0.01 mg/kg/day (eyes, forelimb), 0.025 mg/kg/day (brain, tail and sacral vertebrae, major blood vessels and heart, umbilicus), \u2265 0.025 mg/kg/day (sternum) and at 0.05 mg/kg/day (parietal bones, major blood vessels). Irregular ossification and/or skeletal abnormalities occurred in the skull and jaw, vertebrae and ribs, sternum, pelvis, tail, and scapula; and dose-dependent minor skeletal variations were observed. Visceral abnormalities occurred in blood vessels, lung, liver, and esophagus. Bilobed or bifurcated gallbladder was seen in all treatment groups, but not in the control group. In pregnant female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through weaning or termination of nursing on lactation day 24, estimated systemic exposures were 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day, based on plasma AUC. A slight delay in parturition was observed in the majority of treated rats. Group mean body weight of neonatal rats from liraglutide-treated dams was lower than neonatal rats from control group dams. Bloody scabs and agitated behavior occurred in male rats descended from dams treated with 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide. Group mean body weight from birth to postpartum day 14 trended lower in F 2 generation rats descended from liraglutide-treated rats compared to F 2 generation rats descended from controls, but differences did not reach statistical significance for any group. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of liraglutide injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Liraglutide was present in milk of lactating rats ( see Data) . Developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liraglutide injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liraglutide injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In lactating rats, liraglutide was present unchanged in milk at concentrations approximately 50% of maternal plasma concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide injection as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older. Use of liraglutide injection for this indication is supported by a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial and a 26-week open-label extension in 134 pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a pediatric pharmacokinetic study, and studies in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.2 )] . The risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection in pediatric patients regardless of insulin and/or metformin use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide injection have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the liraglutide injection treatment arms of the glycemic control trials, a total of 832 (19.3%) of the patients were 65 to 74 years of age and 145 (3.4%) were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . No overall differences in safety or effectiveness for liraglutide injection have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of liraglutide injection is recommended for patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The safety and efficacy of liraglutide injection was evaluated in a 26-week clinical study that included patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. There is limited experience with liraglutide injection in patients with end stage renal disease. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There is limited experience in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, liraglutide injection should be used with caution in this patient population. No dose adjustment of liraglutide injection is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Liraglutide injection contains liraglutide, an analog of human GLP-1 and acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist. The liraglutide is produced by a solid phase synthesis and is 97% homologous to native human GLP-1 by substituting arginine for lysine at position 34 and attaching a C-16 fatty acid (palmitic acid) with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26. The molecular formula of liraglutide is C 172 H 265 N 43 O 51 and the molecular weight is 3751.2 Daltons. The structural formula (Figure 1) is: Figure 1: Structural Formula of Liraglutide Liraglutide injection is a sterile, aqueous, clear, colorless solution for subcutaneous use. Each 1 mL of liraglutide injection solution contains 6 mg of liraglutide and the following inactive ingredients: disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, 1.42 mg; phenol, 5.5 mg; propylene glycol, 14 mg; and water for injection. Liraglutide injection has a pH between 8.0 and 8.4, hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH. Each prefilled pen contains a 3 mL solution of liraglutide injection equivalent to 18 mg liraglutide (free-base, anhydrous). Image"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Liraglutide is an acylated human GLP-1 receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7 to 37). GLP-1(7 to 37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7 to 37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7 to 37) has a half-life of 1.5 to 2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-4 and NEP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide injection's pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide injection lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide injection or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0 to 300min was 35% lower after liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide injection 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) liraglutide injection on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner (Figure 2). Figure 2: Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide Injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide injection lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single dose of liraglutide injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide injection causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide injection on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide injection at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to 12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide injection, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0 to \u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0 to \u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide injection is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Pediatric Patients: A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide injection using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide injection in pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients: Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide injection compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups: Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight: Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide injection provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 kg to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment : The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5 to 6) to severe (Child Pugh score > 9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions: Liraglutide injection has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions: The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide injection (8 h to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The coadministration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide injection. Atorvastatin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide injection. Acetaminophen Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following coadministration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide injection at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Liraglutide injection lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide injection on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide injection increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0 to \u221e by 18%. Liraglutide injection delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide injection and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those with liraglutide injection or other liraglutide products. A subset of liraglutide injection-treated patients (1,104 of 2,501, 44%) in five adult double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] and 102/1,104 (9%) of liraglutide injection-treated patients developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Of these 102 liraglutide injection-treated patients, 56 (5%) patients developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 12 (1%) of the liraglutide injection-treated patients. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-liraglutide antibodies on effectiveness of liraglutide injection. In five double-blind adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of liraglutide injection-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for liraglutide injection-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. In a clinical trial with pediatric patients aged 10 years and older [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] , anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 1 (2%) liraglutide injection treated patient at week 26 and 5 (9%) liraglutide injection treated patients at week 53. None of the 5 patients had antibodies cross reactive to native GLP-1 or had neutralizing antibodies. Image"

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Liraglutide is an acylated human GLP-1 receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7 to 37). GLP-1(7 to 37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7 to 37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7 to 37) has a half-life of 1.5 to 2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-4 and NEP."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide injection's pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide injection lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide injection or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0 to 300min was 35% lower after liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide injection 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) liraglutide injection on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner (Figure 2). Figure 2: Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide Injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide injection lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single dose of liraglutide injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide injection causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide injection on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide injection at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to 12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide injection, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0 to \u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0 to \u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide injection is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Pediatric Patients: A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide injection using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide injection in pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients: Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide injection compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups: Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight: Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide injection provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 kg to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment : The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5 to 6) to severe (Child Pugh score > 9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions: Liraglutide injection has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions: The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide injection (8 h to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The coadministration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide injection. Atorvastatin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide injection. Acetaminophen Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following coadministration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide injection at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Liraglutide injection lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide injection on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide injection increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0 to \u221e by 18%. Liraglutide injection delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide injection and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female CD-1 mice at doses of 0.03, 0.2, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection yielding systemic exposures 0.2-, 2-, 10- and 45-times the human exposure, respectively, at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day based on plasma AUC comparison. A dose-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in the 1 and the 3 mg/kg/day groups with incidences of 13% and 19% in males and 6% and 20% in females, respectively. C-cell adenomas did not occur in control groups or 0.03 and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. Treatment-related malignant C-cell carcinomas occurred in 3% of females in the 3.0 mg/kg/day group. Thyroid C-cell tumors are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in mice. A treatment-related increase in fibrosarcomas was seen on the dorsal skin and subcutis, the body surface used for drug injection, in males in the 3 mg/kg/day group. These fibrosarcomas were attributed to the high local concentration of drug near the injection site. The liraglutide concentration in the clinical formulation (6 mg/mL) is 10-times higher than the concentration in the formulation used to administer 3 mg/kg/day liraglutide to mice in the carcinogenicity study (0.6 mg/mL). A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0.075, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection with exposures 0.5-, 2- and 8-times the human exposure, respectively, resulting from the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. A treatment-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in males in 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide groups with incidences of 12%, 16%, 42%, and 46% and in all female liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 10%, 27%, 33%, and 56% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. A treatment-related increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in all male liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 2%, 8%, 6%, and 14% and in females at 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day with incidences of 0%, 0%, 4%, and 6% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. Thyroid C-cell carcinomas are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in rats. Studies in mice demonstrated that liraglutide-induced C-cell proliferation was dependent on the GLP-1 receptor and that liraglutide did not cause activation of the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene in thyroid C-cells. Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats is unknown and has not been determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Liraglutide was negative with and without metabolic activation in the Ames test for mutagenicity and in a human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test for clastogenicity. Liraglutide was negative in repeat-dose in vivo micronucleus tests in rats. In rat fertility studies using subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating until gestation day 17. No direct adverse effects on male fertility was observed at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day, a high dose yielding an estimated systemic exposure 11- times the human exposure at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC. In female rats, an increase in early embryonic deaths occurred at 1 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain and food consumption were observed in females at the 1 mg/kg/day dose."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In glycemic control trials in adults, liraglutide injection has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with one or two oral anti-diabetic medications or basal insulin. In each of the placebo controlled trials, treatment with liraglutide injection produced clinically and statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A 1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo. All liraglutide injection-treated patients started at 0.6 mg/day. The dose was increased in weekly intervals by 0.6 mg to reach 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg for patients randomized to these higher doses. Liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is not effective for glycemic control and is intended only as a starting dose to reduce gastrointestinal intolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Monotherapy In this 52-week trial, 746 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, or glimepiride 8 mg. Patients who were randomized to glimepiride were initially treated with 2 mg daily for two weeks, increasing to 4 mg daily for another two weeks, and finally increasing to 8 mg daily. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and 1.2 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c compared to glimepiride ( Table 3 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.6% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg treatment group, 6% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg treatment group, and 10.1% in the glimepiride-treatment group. The mean age of participants was 53 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 5 years. Participants were 49.7% male, 77.5% White, 12.6% Black or African American and 35% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.1 kg/m 2 .

Randomization occurred after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week initial forced metformin titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin were increased up to 2,000 mg/day. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to metformin resulted in a significant mean HbA 1c reduction relative to placebo add-on to metformin and resulted in a similar mean HbA 1c reduction relative to glimepiride 4 mg add-on to metformin ( Table 4 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 5.4% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin treatment group, 3.3% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + metformin treatment group, 23.8% in the placebo + metformin treatment group, and 3.7% in the glimepiride + metformin treated group. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 7 years. Participants were 58.2% male, 87.1% White and 2.4% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 31 kg/m 2 .

Patients were to continue their current treatment on metformin at a stable, pre-trial dose level and dosing frequency. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 6 years. Participants were 52.9% male, 86.6% White, 7.2% Black or African American and 16.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.8 kg/m 2 . The primary endpoint was the change in HbA 1c from baseline to Week 26. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c relative to sitagliptin 100 mg ( Table 5 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.1% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg group, 0.5% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg treatment group, and 4.1% in the sitagliptin 100 mg treatment group. From a mean baseline body weight of 94 kg, there was a mean reduction of 2.7 kg for liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, 3.3 kg for liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, and 0.8 kg for sitagliptin 100 mg.

Patients who were on metformin and a sulfonylurea discontinued the sulfonylurea then all patients entered a 12-week run-in period during which they received add- on therapy with liraglutide injection titrated to 1.8 mg once-daily. At the end of the run-in period, 498 patients (50%) achieved HbA 1c <7% with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin and continued treatment in a non-randomized, observational arm. Another 167 patients (17%) withdrew from the trial during the run-in period with approximately one-half of these patients doing so because of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The remaining 323 patients with HbA 1c \u22657% (33% of those who entered the run-in period) were randomized to 26 weeks of once-daily insulin detemir administered in the evening as add-on therapy (N=162) or to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin (N=161). The starting dose of insulin detemir was 10 units/day and the mean dose at the end of the 26-week randomized period was 39 units/day. During the 26 week randomized treatment period, the percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 11.2% in the group randomized to continued treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin and 1.2% in the group randomized to add-on therapy with insulin detemir. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 55.7% male, 91.3% White, 5.6% Black or African American and 12.5% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 34 kg/m 2 . Treatment with insulin detemir as add-on to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG compared to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin alone ( Table 6 ). From a mean baseline body weight of 96 kg after randomization, there was a mean reduction of 0.3 kg in the patients who received insulin detemir add-on therapy compared to a mean reduction of 1.1 kg in the patients who continued on unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin alone. Table 6: Results of a 26-week Open Label Trial of Insulin detemir as add on to Liraglutide Injection + Metformin Compared to Continued Treatment with Liraglutide Injection + Metformin alone in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus not Achieving HbA 1c < 7% after 12 weeks of Metformin and Liraglutide Injection Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study Insulin detemir + Liraglutide Injection + Metformin Liraglutide Injection + Metformin Intent-to-Treat Population (N) 162 157 HbA 1c (%) (Mean) Baseline (week 0) Change from baseline (adjusted mean) Difference from liraglutide injection + metformin arm (LS mean) Least squares mean adjusted for baseline value 95% Confidence Interval 7.6 -0.5 -0.5 p-value <0.0001 (-0.7, -0.4) 7.6 0 Percentage of patients achieving HbA 1c <7% 43 17 Fasting Plasma Glucose (mg/dL) (Mean) Baseline (week 0) Change from baseline (adjusted mean) Difference from liraglutide injection + metformin arm (LS mean) 95% Confidence Interval 166 -39 -31 (-39, -23) 159 -7 Add-on to Sulfonylurea: In this 26-week trial, 1,041 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 0.6 mg, liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, placebo, or rosiglitazone 4 mg (one-half of the maximal approved dose in the United States), all as add-on to glimepiride. Randomization occurred after a 4-week run-in period consisting of an initial, 2-week, forced-glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 2 weeks. During the titration period, doses of glimepiride were increased to 4 mg/day. The doses of glimepiride could be reduced (at the discretion of the investigator) from 4 mg/day to 3 mg/day or 2 mg/day (minimum) after randomization, in the event of unacceptable hypoglycemia or other adverse events. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 49.4% male, 64.4% White and 2.8% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 29.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride (Table 7). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 3.5% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 17.5% in the placebo + glimepiride treatment group, and 6.9% in the rosiglitazone + glimepiride treatment group.

Randomization took place after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week forced metformin and glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin and glimepiride were to be increased up to 2,000 mg/day and 4 mg/day, respectively. After randomization, patients randomized to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg underwent a 2 week period of titration with liraglutide injection. During the trial, the liraglutide injection and metformin doses were fixed, although glimepiride and insulin glargine doses could be adjusted. Patients titrated glargine twice-weekly during the first 8 weeks of treatment based on self-measured fasting plasma glucose on the day of titration. After Week 8, the frequency of insulin glargine titration was left to the discretion of the investigator, but, at a minimum, the glargine dose was to be revised, if necessary, at Weeks 12 and 18. Only 20% of glargine-treated patients achieved the pre-specified target fasting plasma glucose of \u2264100 mg/dL. Therefore, optimal titration of the insulin glargine dose was not achieved in most patients. The mean age of participants was 58 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 56.5% male, 75.0% White and 3.6% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 30.5 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection as add-on to glimepiride and metformin resulted in a statistically significant mean reduction in HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride and metformin ( Table 8 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 0.9% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, 0.4% in the insulin glargine + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, and 11.3% in the placebo + metformin + glimepiride treatment group.

Maximally tolerated doses of background therapy were to remain unchanged for the duration of the trial. Patients randomized to exenatide started on a dose of 5 mcg twice-daily for 4 weeks and then were escalated to 10 mcg twice-daily. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 51.9% male, 91.8% White, 5.4% Black or African American and 12.3% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG relative to exenatide ( Table 9 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued for ineffective therapy was 0.4% in the liraglutide injection treatment group and 0% in the exenatide treatment group. Both treatment groups had a mean decrease from baseline in body weight of approximately 3 kg.

Patients underwent a 9 week run-in period (3-week forced dose escalation followed by a 6-week dose maintenance phase) with rosiglitazone (starting at 4 mg and increasing to 8 mg/day within 2 weeks) and metformin (starting at 500 mg with increasing weekly increments of 500 mg to a final dose of 2,000 mg/day). Only patients who tolerated the final dose of rosiglitazone (8 mg/day) and metformin (2000 mg/day) and completed the 6-week dose maintenance phase were eligible for randomization into the trial. The mean age of participants was 55 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 61.6% male, 84.2% White, 10.2% Black or African American and 16.4% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection as add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone produced a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone ( Table 10 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 1.7% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, 1.7% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, and 16.4% in the placebo + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group.

Liraglutide injection was added to the patient's stable pre-trial antidiabetic regimen (insulin therapy and/or metformin, pioglitazone, or sulfonylurea). The dose of liraglutide injection was escalated according to approved labeling to achieve a dose of 1.8 mg per day. The insulin dose was reduced by 20% at randomization for patients with baseline HbA 1c \u2264 8% and fixed until liraglutide dose escalation was complete. Dose reduction of insulin and SU was allowed in case of hypoglycemia; up titration of insulin was allowed but not beyond the pre-trial dose. The mean age of participants was 67 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Participants were 50.5% male, 92.3% White, 6.6% Black or African American, and 7.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 . Approximately half of patients had an eGFR between 30 and < 45mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c from baseline at Week 26 compared to placebo (see Table 11 ). 123 patients reached the 1.8 mg dose of liraglutide injection.

Patients were randomized to liraglutide injection once-daily or placebo once-daily in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin treatment. All patients were on a metformin dose of 1000 to 2000 mg prior to randomization. The basal insulin dose was decreased by 20% at randomization and liraglutide injection was titrated weekly by 0.6 mg for 2 to 3 weeks based on tolerability and an average fasting plasma glucose goal of \u2264110 mg/dL. The mean age was 14.6 years: 29.9% were ages 10 to 14 years, and 70.1% were greater than 14 years of age. 38.1% were male, 64.9% were White, 13.4% were Asian, 11.9% were Black or African American; 29.1% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 and the mean BMI SDS was 2.9. 18.7% of patients were using basal insulin at baseline. The mean duration of diabetes was 1.9 years and the mean HbA 1c was 7.8%. At week 26, treatment with liraglutide injection was superior in reducing HbA 1c from baseline versus placebo. The estimated treatment difference in HbA 1c reduction from baseline between liraglutide injection and placebo was -1.06% with a 95% confidence interval of [-1.65%; -0.46%] (see Table 12 ).

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Inform patients that liraglutide causes benign and malignant thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats and that the human relevance of this finding is unknown. Counsel patients to report symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a lump in the neck, hoarseness, dysphagia, or dyspnea) to their physician [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Acute Pancreatitis Inform patients of the potential risk for acute pancreatitis and its symptoms: severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back, and which may or may not be accompanied by nausea or vomiting.

Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients Advise patients that they must never share a liraglutide injection pen with another person, even if the needle is changed, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypoglycemia Inform patients that hypoglycemia has been reported when liraglutide injection is used with insulin secretagogues or insulin and may occur in pediatric patients regardless of concomitant antidiabetic treatment. Educate patients or caregivers on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion Inform patients of the potential risk of acute kidney injury due to dehydration associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Advise patients to take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury and instruct them to promptly report any of these signs or symptoms or persistent (or extended) nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Inform patients of the potential risk of severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if they have severe or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients that serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of liraglutide injection.

Caring for your liraglutide injection pen \u2022 After removing the needle, put the pen cap on your liraglutide injection pen and store your liraglutide injection pen without the needle attached (See Figure R). \u2022 Do not try to refill your liraglutide injection pen \u2013 it is prefilled and is disposable. \u2022 Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart. \u2022 Keep your liraglutide injection pen away from dust, dirt and liquids. \u2022 If cleaning is needed, wipe the outside of the pen with a clean, damp cloth. How should I store liraglutide injection? Before use: Store your new, unused liraglutide injection pen in the refrigerator between 36\u00baF to 46\u00baF (2\u00baC to 8\u00baC). If liraglutide injection is stored outside of refrigeration (by mistake) prior to first use, it should be used or thrown away within 30 days. Do not freeze liraglutide injection or use liraglutide injection if it has been frozen. Do not store liraglutide injection near the refrigerator cooling element. Pen in use: Use a liraglutide injection pen for only 30 days. Throw away a used liraglutide injection pen 30 days after you start using it, even if some medicine is left in the pen. Store your liraglutide injection pen at room temperature between 59\u00baF to 86\u00baF (15\u00baC to 30\u00baC), or in a refrigerator between 36\u00baF to 46\u00baF (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). When carrying the pen away from home, store the pen at room temperature between 59\u00baF to 86\u00baF (15\u00baC to 30\u00baC). If liraglutide injection has been exposed to temperatures above 86\u00baF (30\u00baC), it should be thrown away. Protect your liraglutide injection pen from heat and sunlight. Keep the pen cap on when your liraglutide injection pen is not in use. Always remove the needle after each injection and store your pen without the needle attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage and inaccurate dosing. This Instructions for Use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Adult Patients : Initiate at 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for one week then increase to 1.2 mg daily. If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dose to 1.8 mg daily after one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg daily dose (2.1) . \u2022 Pediatric Patients : Initiate at 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for at least one week. If additional glycemic control is required increase the dose to 1.2 mg daily and if additional glycemic control is still required, increase the dose to 1.8 mg daily after at least one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg daily dose (2.1) . \u2022 Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles (2.3) . \u2022 Inject liraglutide subcutaneously once-daily at any time of day, independently of meals, in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm (2.3) . \u2022 When using liraglutide with insulin, administer as separate injections. Never mix. (2.3) . 2.1 Recommended Dosage Adult Patients \u2022 The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for one week. The 0.6 mg once daily dosage is intended to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] during initial titration and is not effective for glycemic control in adults. \u2022 After one week at the 0.6 mg once daily dosage, increase the dosage to 1.2 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. \u2022 If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage to the maximum recommended dosage of 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily after at least one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg once daily dosage. Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older \u2022 The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. \u2022 If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage in 0.6 mg increments after at least one week on the current dosage. \u2022 The maximum recommended dosage is 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. 2.2 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose \u2022 Instruct patients who miss a dose of liraglutide to resume the once-daily dosage regimen as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Do not administer an extra dose or increase the dose to make up for the missed dose. \u2022 If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last liraglutide dose, reinitiate liraglutide at 0.6 mg once daily to mitigate any gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment. Upon reinitiation, liraglutide should be titrated at the discretion of the healthcare provider. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions \u2022 Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles. \u2022 Inject liraglutide subcutaneously once daily at any time of day, independently of meals. \u2022 Inject liraglutide subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. No dosage adjustment is needed if changing the injection site and/or timing. \u2022 Rotate injection sites within the same region in order to reduce the risk of cutaneous amyloidosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. \u2022 When using liraglutide with insulin, administer as separate injections.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Pancreatitis : Postmarketing reports, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. Discontinue promptly if pancreatitis is suspected. Do not restart if pancreatitis is confirmed (5.2) . \u2022 Never share a liraglutide pen between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.3) . \u2022 Hypoglycemia: Adult patients taking an insulin secretagogue or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide regardless of insulin and/or metformin use. Reduction in the dose of insulin secretagogues or insulin may be necessary (5.4) . \u2022 Acute Kidney Injury : Postmarketing, usually in association with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration which may sometimes require hemodialysis. Use caution when initiating or escalating doses of liraglutide in patients with renal impairment (5.5) . \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions : Postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema). Discontinue liraglutide and promptly seek medical advice (5.6) . \u2022 Acute Gallbladder Disease : If cholelithiasis or cholecystitis are suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated (5.7) . 5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether liraglutide will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and liraglutide use in humans. Liraglutide is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of liraglutide and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated. 5.2 Pancreatitis Based on spontaneous postmarketing reports, acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with liraglutide. After initiation of liraglutide, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, liraglutide should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, liraglutide should not be restarted. In glycemic control trials of liraglutide, there have been 13 cases of pancreatitis among liraglutide-treated patients and 1 case in a comparator (glimepiride) treated patient (2.7 vs. 0.5 cases per 1000 patient-years). Nine of the 13 cases with liraglutide were reported as acute pancreatitis and four were reported as chronic pancreatitis. In one case in a liraglutide-treated patient, pancreatitis, with necrosis, was observed and led to death; however clinical causality could not be established. Some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse. Liraglutide has been studied in a limited number of patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown if patients with a history of pancreatitis are at higher risk for development of pancreatitis on liraglutide. 5.3 Never Share a Liraglutide Pen Between Patients Liraglutide pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Adult patients receiving liraglutide in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide regardless of insulin and/or metformin use. [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications and pediatric patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.5 Acute Kidney Injury Liraglutide has not been found to be directly nephrotoxic in animal studies or clinical trials. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis in liraglutide-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Some of the reported events occurred in patients receiving one or more medications known to affect renal function or hydration status. Altered renal function has been reversed in many of the reported cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including liraglutide. Use caution when initiating or escalating doses of liraglutide in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with liraglutide [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue liraglutide; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with liraglutide. Liraglutide is contraindicated in patients who have had a serious hypersensitivity reaction to liraglutide or any of the excipients in liraglutide [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Acute Gallbladder Disease Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing. In the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , 3.1% of liraglutide-treated patients versus 1.9% of placebo-treated patients reported an acute event of gallbladder disease, such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information: \u2022 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Acute Kidney Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Acute Gallbladder Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655%) in clinical trials are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, dyspepsia, constipation (6.1) . \u2022 Immunogenicity-related events, including urticaria, were more common among liraglutide-treated patients (0.8%) than among comparator-treated patients (0.4%) in clinical trials (12.6) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Common Adverse Reactions The safety of liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled trials in adults and one trial of 52 weeks duration in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The data in Table 1 reflect exposure of 1,673 adult patients to liraglutide and a mean duration of exposure to liraglutide of 37.3 weeks. The mean age of adult patients was 58 years, 4% were 75 years or older and 54% were male. The population was 79% White, 6% Black or African American, 13% Asian; 4% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years and a mean HbA 1c of 8.4%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% and moderately impaired in 12% of the pooled population. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions in adults, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of liraglutide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on liraglutide than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with liraglutide. Overall, the type, and severity of adverse reactions in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older and above were comparable to that observed in the adult population. Table 1. Adverse reactions reported in \u22655% of Adult Patients Treated with Liraglutide for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Placebo N=661 Liraglutide 1.2 mg N=645 Liraglutide 1.8 mg N=1024 Adverse Reaction (%) (%) (%) Nausea 5 18 20 Diarrhea 4 10 12 Headache 7 11 10 Nasopharyngitis 8 9 10 Vomiting 2 6 9 Decreased appetite 1 10 9 Dyspepsia 1 4 7 Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 6 7 6 Constipation 1 5 5 Back Pain 3 4 5 Cumulative proportions were calculated combining studies using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weights. In an analysis of placebo- and active-controlled trials, the types and frequency of common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, were similar to those listed in Table 1 . Other Adverse Reactions Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions In the pool of 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled adult clinical trials, withdrawals due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions, occurred in 4.3% of liraglutide-treated patients and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Withdrawal due to gastrointestinal adverse events mainly occurred during the first 2 to 3 months of the trials. Injection site reactions Injection site reactions (e.g., injection site rash, erythema) were reported in approximately 2% of liraglutide-treated adult patients in the five double-blind, glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration. Less than 0.2% of liraglutide-treated patients discontinued due to injection site reactions. Hypoglycemia In 5 adult glycemic control, placebo-controlled clinical trials of at least 26 weeks duration, hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person for treatment occurred in 8 liraglutide-treated patients (7.5 events per 1000 patient-years). Of these 8 liraglutide-treated patients, 7 patients were concomitantly using a sulfonylurea. Table 2.

In a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with a 26-week open-label extension, 21.2% of liraglutide-treated patients (mean age 14.6 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus, had hypoglycemia with a blood glucose <54 mg/dL with or without symptoms (335 events per 1000 patient years). No severe hypoglycemic episodes occurred in the liraglutide treatment group (severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions). Papillary thyroid carcinoma In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide, there were 7 reported cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma in patients treated with liraglutide and 1 case in a comparator-treated patient (1.5 vs. 0.5 cases per 1000 patient-years). Most of these papillary thyroid carcinomas were <1 cm in greatest diameter and were diagnosed in surgical pathology specimens after thyroidectomy prompted by findings on protocol-specified screening with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide, the incidence of cholelithiasis was 0.3% in both liraglutide-treated and placebo-treated patients. The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.2% in both liraglutide-treated and placebo-treated patients. In the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , the incidence of cholelithiasis was 1.5% (3.9 cases per 1000 patient years of observation) in adult liraglutide-treated and 1.1% (2.8 cases per 1000 patient years of observation) in placebo-treated patients, both on a background of standard of care. The incidence of acute cholecystitis was 1.1% (2.9 cases per 1000 patient years of observation) in adult liraglutide-treated and 0.7% (1.9 cases per 1000 patient years of observation) in placebo-treated patients. The majority of events required hospitalization or cholecystectomy. Laboratory Tests Bilirubin In the five adult glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration, mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (elevations to no more than twice the upper limit of the reference range) occurred in 4.0% of liraglutide-treated patients, 2.1% of placebo-treated patients and 3.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. This finding was not accompanied by abnormalities in other liver tests. The significance of this isolated finding is unknown. Calcitonin Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program. At the end of the adult glycemic control trials, adjusted mean serum calcitonin concentrations were higher in liraglutide-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients but not compared to patients receiving active comparator. Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less. Among adult patients with pretreatment calcitonin <20 ng/L, calcitonin elevations to >20 ng/L occurred in 0.7% of liraglutide-treated patients, 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, and 0.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Lipase and Amylase In one adult glycemic control trial in renal impairment patients, a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed for liraglutide-treated patients while placebo-treated patients had a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%. In the LEADER trial, serum lipase and amylase were routinely measured. Among adult liraglutide-treated patients, 7.9% had a lipase value at any time during treatment of greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal compared with 4.5% of placebo-treated patients, and 1% of liraglutide-treated patients had an amylase value at any time during treatment of greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal versus 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with liraglutide is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Vital signs Liraglutide did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed in adult patients treated with liraglutide compared to placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of liraglutide. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Gastrointestinal: Acute pancreatitis, hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis sometimes resulting in death, ileus \u2022 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Allergic reactions: rash and pruritus \u2022 Hepatobiliary: Elevations of liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy, hepatitis \u2022 Immune system: Angioedema and anaphylactic reactions \u2022 Metabolism and nutrition: Dehydration resulting from nausea, vomiting and diarrhea \u2022 Neoplasms: Medullary thyroid carcinoma \u2022 Nervous system: Dysgeusia, dizziness \u2022 Renal and urinary: Increased serum creatinine, acute renal failure or worsening of chronic renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis. \u2022 Skin and subcutaneous tissue: Cutaneous amyloidosis"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Effects of delayed gastric emptying on oral medications: Liraglutide delays gastric emptying and may impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications (7). 7.1 Effects of Delayed Gastric Emptying on Oral Medications Liraglutide causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials, liraglutide did not affect the absorption of the tested orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with liraglutide. 7.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin Liraglutide stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. Patients receiving liraglutide in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. When initiating liraglutide, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Liraglutide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus (8.1) . 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to liraglutide during pregnancy. Liraglutide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal reproduction studies identified increased adverse developmental outcomes from exposure during pregnancy. Liraglutide exposure was associated with early embryonic deaths and an imbalance in some fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats administered liraglutide during organogenesis at doses that approximate clinical exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.8 mg/day. In pregnant rabbits administered liraglutide during organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of major fetal abnormalities were seen at exposures below the human exposures at the MRHD [see Animal Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects for women with uncontrolled pre-gestational diabetes (Hemoglobin A 1c >7) is 6 to 10%. The major birth defect rate has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a Hemoglobin A 1c >10. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Animal Data Female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide beginning 2 weeks before mating through gestation day 17 had estimated systemic exposures 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times the human exposure at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. The number of early embryonic deaths in the 1 mg/kg/day group increased slightly. Fetal abnormalities and variations in kidneys and blood vessels, irregular ossification of the skull, and a more complete state of ossification occurred at all doses. Mottled liver and minimally kinked ribs occurred at the highest dose. The incidence of fetal malformations in liraglutide-treated groups exceeding concurrent and historical controls were misshapen oropharynx and/or narrowed opening into larynx at 0.1 mg/kg/day and umbilical hernia at 0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg/day. Pregnant rabbits given subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through day 18 inclusive, had estimated systemic exposures less than the human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day at all doses, based on plasma AUC. Liraglutide decreased fetal weight and dose-dependently increased the incidence of total major fetal abnormalities at all doses. The incidence of malformations exceeded concurrent and historical controls at 0.01 mg/kg/day (kidneys, scapula), \u22650.01 mg/kg/day (eyes, forelimb), 0.025 mg/kg/day (brain, tail and sacral vertebrae, major blood vessels and heart, umbilicus), \u22650.025 mg/kg/day (sternum) and at 0.05 mg/kg/day (parietal bones, major blood vessels). Irregular ossification and/or skeletal abnormalities occurred in the skull and jaw, vertebrae and ribs, sternum, pelvis, tail, and scapula; and dose-dependent minor skeletal variations were observed. Visceral abnormalities occurred in blood vessels, lung, liver, and esophagus. Bilobed or bifurcated gallbladder was seen in all treatment groups, but not in the control group. In pregnant female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through weaning or termination of nursing on lactation day 24, estimated systemic exposures were 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day, based on plasma AUC. A slight delay in parturition was observed in the majority of treated rats. Group mean body weight of neonatal rats from liraglutide-treated dams was lower than neonatal rats from control group dams. Bloody scabs and agitated behavior occurred in male rats descended from dams treated with 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide. Group mean body weight from birth to postpartum day 14 trended lower in F 2 generation rats descended from liraglutide-treated rats compared to F 2 generation rats descended from controls, but differences did not reach statistical significance for any group. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of liraglutide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Liraglutide was present in milk of lactating rats [see Data] . Developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for liraglutide and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liraglutide or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In lactating rats, liraglutide was present unchanged in milk at concentrations approximately 50% of maternal plasma concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older. Use of liraglutide for this indication is supported by a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial and a 26-week open-label extension in 134 pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a pediatric pharmacokinetic study, and studies in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.1 , 14.2 )] . The risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide in pediatric patients regardless of insulin and/or metformin use [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the liraglutide treatment arms of the glycemic control trials, a total of 832 (19.3%) of the patients were 65 to 74 years of age and 145 (3.4%) were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . In the liraglutide treatment arm of the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , a total of 1738 (37.2%) patients were 65 to 74 years of age, 401 (8.6%) were 75 to 84 years of age, and 17 (0.4%) were 85 years of age or older at baseline. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness for liraglutide have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of liraglutide is recommended for patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety and efficacy of liraglutide was evaluated in a 26-week clinical study that included patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In the liraglutide treatment arm of the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ], 1932 (41.4%) patients had mild renal impairment, 999 (21.4%) patients had moderate renal impairment and 117 (2.5%) patients had severe renal impairment at baseline. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were seen in these patients compared to patients with normal renal function. There is limited experience with liraglutide in patients with end stage renal disease. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Use caution in patients who experience dehydration. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There is limited experience in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, liraglutide should be used with caution in this patient population. No dose adjustment of liraglutide is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.8 Gastroparesis Liraglutide slows gastric emptying. Liraglutide has not been studied in patients with pre-existing gastroparesis."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to liraglutide during pregnancy. Liraglutide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal reproduction studies identified increased adverse developmental outcomes from exposure during pregnancy. Liraglutide exposure was associated with early embryonic deaths and an imbalance in some fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats administered liraglutide during organogenesis at doses that approximate clinical exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.8 mg/day. In pregnant rabbits administered liraglutide during organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of major fetal abnormalities were seen at exposures below the human exposures at the MRHD [see Animal Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects for women with uncontrolled pre-gestational diabetes (Hemoglobin A 1c >7) is 6 to 10%. The major birth defect rate has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a Hemoglobin A 1c >10. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Liraglutide injection contains liraglutide, an analog of human GLP-1 and acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist. The peptide precursor of liraglutide, produced by a process that includes expression of recombinant DNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been engineered to be 97% homologous to native human GLP-1 by substituting arginine for lysine at position 34. Liraglutide is made by attaching a C-16 fatty acid (palmitic acid) with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26 of the peptide precursor. The molecular formula of liraglutide is C 172 H 265 N 43 O 51 and the molecular weight is 3751.2 Daltons. The structural formula ( Figure 1 ) is: Figure 1. Structural Formula of Liraglutide Liraglutide injection is a sterile, aqueous, clear, colorless or almost colorless solution for subcutaneous use. Each 1 mL of liraglutide injection solution contains 6 mg of liraglutide and the following inactive ingredients: disodium phosphate dihydrate, 1.42 mg; propylene glycol, 14 mg; phenol, 5.5 mg; and water for injection. Liraglutide injection has a pH of approximately 8.15, hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH. Each prefilled pen contains a 3 mL solution of liraglutide equivalent to 18 mg liraglutide (free-base, anhydrous). figure-1"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Liraglutide is an acylated human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37). GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-IV and NEP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide\u2019s pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single-dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) liraglutide on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single-dose of liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. figure-2 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to 12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single-dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single-dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single-dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide in the pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5-6) to severe (Child Pugh score >9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide (8 to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single-dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single-dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The co-administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide. Atorvastatin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single-dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide. Acetaminophen Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single-dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single-dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single-dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Liraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those with liraglutide or other liraglutide products. A subset of liraglutide-treated patients (1104 of 2501, 44%) in five adult double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] and 102/1104 (9%) of liraglutide-treated patients developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Of these 102 liraglutide-treated patients, 56 (5%) patients developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 12 (1%) of the liraglutide-treated patients. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-liraglutide antibodies on effectiveness of liraglutide. In five double-blind adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of liraglutide-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for liraglutide-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. In the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 11 out of the 1247 (0.9%) adult liraglutide-treated patients with antibody measurements. Of the 11 adult liraglutide-treated patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies, none were observed to develop neutralizing antibodies to liraglutide, and 5 patients (0.4%) developed cross-reacting antibodies against native GLP-1. In a clinical trial with pediatric patients aged 10 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ], anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 1 (2%) liraglutide treated patient at week 26 and 5 (9%) liraglutide treated patients at week 53. None of the 5 patients had antibodies cross reactive to native GLP-1 or had neutralizing antibodies."

In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2.

At 1.8 mg liraglutide, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single-dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide in the pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5-6) to severe (Child Pugh score >9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide (8 to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single-dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single-dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The co-administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide. Atorvastatin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single-dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide. Acetaminophen Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single-dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single-dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single-dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Liraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female CD-1 mice at doses of 0.03, 0.2, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection yielding systemic exposures 0.2-, 2-, 10- and 45-times the human exposure, respectively, at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day based on plasma AUC comparison. A dose-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in the 1.0 and the 3.0 mg/kg/day groups with incidences of 13% and 19% in males and 6% and 20% in females, respectively. C-cell adenomas did not occur in control groups or 0.03 and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. Treatment-related malignant C-cell carcinomas occurred in 3% of females in the 3.0 mg/kg/day group. Thyroid C-cell tumors are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in mice. A treatment-related increase in fibrosarcomas was seen on the dorsal skin and subcutis, the body surface used for drug injection, in males in the 3 mg/kg/day group. These fibrosarcomas were attributed to the high local concentration of drug near the injection site. The liraglutide concentration in the clinical formulation (6 mg/mL) is 10-times higher than the concentration in the formulation used to administer 3 mg/kg/day liraglutide to mice in the carcinogenicity study (0.6 mg/mL). A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0.075, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection with exposures 0.5-, 2- and 8-times the human exposure, respectively, resulting from the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. A treatment-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in males in 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide groups with incidences of 12%, 16%, 42%, and 46% and in all female liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 10%, 27%, 33%, and 56% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. A treatment-related increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in all male liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 2%, 8%, 6%, and 14% and in females at 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day with incidences of 0%, 0%, 4%, and 6% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. Thyroid C-cell carcinomas are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in rats. Studies in mice demonstrated that liraglutide-induced C-cell proliferation was dependent on the GLP-1 receptor and that liraglutide did not cause activation of the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene in thyroid C-cells. Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats is unknown and has not been determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Liraglutide was negative with and without metabolic activation in the Ames test for mutagenicity and in a human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test for clastogenicity. Liraglutide was negative in repeat-dose in vivo micronucleus tests in rats. In rat fertility studies using subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating until gestation day 17. No direct adverse effects on male fertility was observed at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day, a high dose yielding an estimated systemic exposure 11-times the human exposure at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC. In female rats, an increase in early embryonic deaths occurred at 1.0 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain and food consumption were observed in females at the 1.0 mg/kg/day dose."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In glycemic control trials in adults, liraglutide has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with one or two oral anti-diabetic medications or basal insulin. Liraglutide was also studied in a cardiovascular outcomes trial (LEADER trial). In each of the placebo controlled trials, treatment with liraglutide produced clinically and statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A 1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo. All liraglutide-treated patients started at 0.6 mg/day. The dose was increased in weekly intervals by 0.6 mg to reach 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg for patients randomized to these higher doses. Liraglutide 0.6 mg is not effective for glycemic control and is intended only as a starting dose to reduce gastrointestinal intolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Monotherapy In this 52-week trial, 746 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide 1.2 mg, liraglutide 1.8 mg, or glimepiride 8 mg. Patients who were randomized to glimepiride were initially treated with 2 mg daily for two weeks, increasing to 4 mg daily for another two weeks, and finally increasing to 8 mg daily. Treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg and 1.2 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c compared to glimepiride ( Table 3 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.6% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg treatment group, 6.0% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg treatment group, and 10.1% in the glimepiride-treatment group. The mean age of participants was 53 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 5 years. Participants were 49.7% male, 77.5% White, 12.6% Black or African American and 35.0% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.1 kg/m 2 . Table 3.

Randomization occurred after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week initial forced metformin titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin were increased up to 2000 mg/day. Treatment with liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to metformin resulted in a significant mean HbA 1c reduction relative to placebo add-on to metformin and resulted in a similar mean HbA 1c reduction relative to glimepiride 4 mg add-on to metformin ( Table 4 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 5.4% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin treatment group, 3.3% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg + metformin treatment group, 23.8% in the placebo + metformin treatment group, and 3.7% in the glimepiride + metformin treated group.

Patients were to continue their current treatment on metformin at a stable, pre-trial dose level and dosing frequency. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 6 years. Participants were 52.9% male, 86.6% White, 7.2% Black or African American and 16.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.8 kg/m 2 . The primary endpoint was the change in HbA 1c from baseline to Week 26. Treatment with liraglutide 1.2 mg and liraglutide 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c relative to sitagliptin 100 mg ( Table 5 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.1% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg group, 0.5% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg treatment group, and 4.1% in the sitagliptin 100 mg treatment group. From a mean baseline body weight of 94 kg, there was a mean reduction of 2.7 kg for liraglutide 1.2 mg, 3.3 kg for liraglutide 1.8 mg, and 0.8 kg for sitagliptin 100 mg. Table 5.

Mean HbA 1c for Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who Completed the 26-week Trial and for the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF, intent-to-treat) Data at Week 26 Combination Therapy with Metformin and Insulin This 26-week open-label trial enrolled 988 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control (HbA 1c 7 to 10%) on metformin (\u22651,500 mg/day) alone or inadequate glycemic control (HbA 1c 7 to 8.5%) on metformin (\u22651500 mg/day) and a sulfonylurea. Patients who were on metformin and a sulfonylurea discontinued the sulfonylurea then all patients entered a 12-week run-in period during which they received add-on therapy with liraglutide titrated to 1.8 mg once-daily. At the end of the run-in period, 498 patients (50%) achieved HbA 1c <7% with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin and continued treatment in a non-randomized, observational arm. Another 167 patients (17%) withdrew from the trial during the run-in period with approximately one-half of these patients doing so because of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The remaining 323 patients with HbA 1c \u22657% (33% of those who entered the run-in period) were randomized to 26 weeks of once-daily insulin detemir administered in the evening as add-on therapy (N=162) or to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin (N=161). The starting dose of insulin detemir was 10 units/day and the mean dose at the end of the 26-week randomized period was 39 units/day. During the 26-week randomized treatment period, the percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 11.2% in the group randomized to continued treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin and 1.2% in the group randomized to add-on therapy with insulin detemir. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 55.7% male, 91.3% White, 5.6% Black or African American and 12.5% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 34.0 kg/m 2 . Treatment with insulin detemir as add-on to liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG compared to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin alone ( Table 6 ). From a mean baseline body weight of 96 kg after randomization, there was a mean reduction of 0.3 kg in the patients who received insulin detemir add-on therapy compared to a mean reduction of 1.1 kg in the patients who continued on unchanged treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin alone.

Randomization occurred after a 4-week run-in period consisting of an initial, 2-week, forced-glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 2 weeks. During the titration period, doses of glimepiride were increased to 4 mg/day. The doses of glimepiride could be reduced (at the discretion of the investigator) from 4 mg/day to 3 mg/day or 2 mg/day (minimum) after randomization, in the event of unacceptable hypoglycemia or other adverse events. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 49.4% male, 64.4% White and 2.8% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 29.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride ( Table 7 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.0% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 3.5% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 17.5% in the placebo + glimepiride treatment group, and 6.9% in the rosiglitazone + glimepiride treatment group.

Randomization took place after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week forced metformin and glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin and glimepiride were to be increased up to 2,000 mg/day and 4 mg/day, respectively. After randomization, patients randomized to liraglutide 1.8 mg underwent a 2-week period of titration with liraglutide. During the trial, the liraglutide and metformin doses were fixed, although glimepiride and insulin glargine doses could be adjusted. Patients titrated glargine twice-weekly during the first 8 weeks of treatment based on self-measured fasting plasma glucose on the day of titration. After Week 8, the frequency of insulin glargine titration was left to the discretion of the investigator, but, at a minimum, the glargine dose was to be revised, if necessary, at Weeks 12 and 18. Only 20% of glargine-treated patients achieved the pre-specified target fasting plasma glucose of \u2264100 mg/dL. Therefore, optimal titration of the insulin glargine dose was not achieved in most patients. The mean age of participants was 58 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 56.5% male, 75.0% White and 3.6% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 30.5 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide as add-on to glimepiride and metformin resulted in a statistically significant mean reduction in HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride and metformin ( Table 8 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 0.9% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, 0.4% in the insulin glargine + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, and 11.3% in the placebo + metformin + glimepiride treatment group.

Maximally tolerated doses of background therapy were to remain unchanged for the duration of the trial. Patients randomized to exenatide started on a dose of 5 mcg twice-daily for 4 weeks and then were escalated to 10 mcg twice daily. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 51.9% male, 91.8% White, 5.4% Black or African American and 12.3% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG relative to exenatide ( Table 9 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued for ineffective therapy was 0.4% in the liraglutide treatment group and 0% in the exenatide treatment group. Both treatment groups had a mean decrease from baseline in body weight of approximately 3 kg. Table 9.

Patients underwent a 9-week run-in period (3-week forced dose escalation followed by a 6-week dose maintenance phase) with rosiglitazone (starting at 4 mg and increasing to 8 mg/day within 2 weeks) and metformin (starting at 500 mg with increasing weekly increments of 500 mg to a final dose of 2,000 mg/day). Only patients who tolerated the final dose of rosiglitazone (8 mg/day) and metformin (2000 mg/day) and completed the 6-week dose maintenance phase were eligible for randomization into the trial. The mean age of participants was 55 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 61.6% male, 84.2% White, 10.2% Black or African American and 16.4% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide as add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone produced a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone ( Table 10 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 1.7% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, 1.7% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, and 16.4% in the placebo + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group.

Liraglutide was added to the patient\u2019s stable pre-trial antidiabetic regimen (insulin therapy and/or metformin, pioglitazone, or sulfonylurea). The dose of liraglutide was escalated according to approved labeling to achieve a dose of 1.8 mg per day. The insulin dose was reduced by 20% at randomization for patients with baseline HbA 1c \u22648% and fixed until liraglutide dose escalation was complete. Dose reduction of insulin and SU was allowed in case of hypoglycemia; up titration of insulin was allowed but not beyond the pre-trial dose. The mean age of participants was 67 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Participants were 50.5% male, 92.3% White, 6.6% Black or African American, and 7.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 . Approximately half of patients had an eGFR between 30 and <45mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c from baseline at Week 26 compared to placebo (see Table 11 ). 123 patients reached the 1.8 mg dose of liraglutide.

Patients were randomized to liraglutide once-daily or placebo once-daily in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin treatment. All patients were on a metformin dose of 1000 to 2000 mg prior to randomization. The basal insulin dose was decreased by 20% at randomization and liraglutide was titrated weekly by 0.6 mg for 2 to 3 weeks based on tolerability and an average fasting plasma glucose goal of \u2264110 mg/dL. The mean age was 14.6 years: 29.9% were ages 10 to 14 years, and 70.1% were greater than 14 years of age. 38.1% were male, 64.9% were White, 13.4% were Asian, 11.9% were Black or African American; 29.1% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 and the mean BMI SDS was 2.9. 18.7% of patients were using basal insulin at baseline. The mean duration of diabetes was 1.9 years and the mean HbA 1c was 7.8%. At week 26, treatment with liraglutide was superior in reducing HbA 1c from baseline versus placebo. The estimated treatment difference in HbA 1c reduction from baseline between liraglutide and placebo was -1.06% with a 95% confidence interval of [-1.65%; -0.46%] (see Table 12 ). Table 12.

Missing observations (10.6% in the liraglutide, 14.5% in the placebo) were imputed from the placebo arm based on multiple (x10,000) imputations. The data for week 26 was then analyzed with an ANCOVA model containing treatment, sex and age group as fixed effects and baseline value as covariate. b Categories are derived from continuous measurements of HbA 1c using a pattern mixture model with multiple imputation for missing observations. * p-value <0.001 Liraglutide + Metformin \u00b1 Basal Insulin Placebo + Metformin \u00b1 Basal Insulin N 66 68 HbA 1c (%) Baseline 7.9 7.7 End of 26 weeks 7.1 8.2 Adjusted mean change from baseline after 26 weeks a -0.64 0.42 Treatment difference [95% CI] Liraglutide vs Placebo -1.06 [-1.65; -0.46] * Percentage of patients achieving HbA 1c <7% b 63.7 36.5 FPG (mg/dL) Baseline 157 147 End of 26 weeks 132 166 Adjusted mean change from baseline after 26 weeks a -19.4 14.4 Treatment difference [95% CI] Liraglutide vs Placebo -33.83 [-55.74; -11.92] 14.3 Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease The LEADER trial (NCT01179048) was a multi-national, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. In this study, 9,340 adult patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) were randomized to liraglutide 1.8 mg or placebo for a median duration of 3.5 years. The study compared the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events between liraglutide and placebo when these were added to, and used concomitantly with, background standard of care treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary endpoint, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), was the time to first occurrence of a three-part composite outcome which included; cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke. Patients eligible to enter the trial were; 50 years of age or older and had established, stable, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II and III heart failure (80% of the enrolled population) or were 60 years of age or older and had other specified risk factors for cardiovascular disease (20% of the enrolled population). At baseline, demographic and disease characteristics were balanced. The mean age was 64 years and the population was 64.3% male, 77.5% White, 10.0% Asian, and 8.3% Black or African American. In the study, 12.1% of the population identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 12.8 years, the mean HbA 1c was 8.7% and the mean BMI was 32.5 kg/m 2 . A history of previous myocardial infarction was reported in 31% of randomized individuals, a prior revascularization procedure in 39%, a prior ischemic stroke in 11%, documented symptomatic coronary disease in 9%, documented asymptomatic cardiac ischemia in 26%, and a diagnosis of NYHA class II to III heart failure in 14%. The mean eGFR at baseline was 79 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and 41.8% of patients had mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) , 20.7% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) and 2.4% of patients had severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). At baseline, patients treated their diabetes with; diet and exercise only (3.9%), oral antidiabetic drugs only (51.5%), oral antidiabetic drugs and insulin (36.7%) or insulin only (7.9%). The most common background antidiabetic drugs used at baseline and in the trial were metformin, sulfonylurea and insulin. Use of DPP-4 inhibitors and other GLP-1 receptor agonists was excluded by protocol and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors were either not approved or not widely available. At baseline, cardiovascular disease and risk factors were managed with; non-diuretic antihypertensives (92.4%), diuretics (41.8%), statin therapy (72.1%) and platelet aggregation inhibitors (66.8%). During the trial, investigators could modify anti-diabetic and cardiovascular medications to achieve local standard of care treatment targets with respect to blood glucose, lipid, and blood pressure, and manage patients recovering from an acute coronary syndrome or stroke event per local treatment guidelines. For the primary analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for non-inferiority against the pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE and to test for superiority on MACE if non-inferiority was demonstrated. Type 1 error was controlled across multiple tests. Liraglutide significantly reduced the occurrence of MACE. The estimated hazard ratio (95% CI) for time to first MACE was 0.87 (0.78, 0.97). Refer to Figure 5 and Table 13 . Vital status was available for 99.7% of subjects in the trial. A total of 828 deaths were recorded during the LEADER trial. A majority of the deaths in the trial were categorized as cardiovascular deaths and non-cardiovascular deaths were balanced between the treatment groups (3.5% in patients treated with liraglutide and 3.6% in patients treated with placebo). The estimated hazard ratio of time to all-cause death for liraglutide compared to placebo was 0.85 (0.74, 0.97). Figure 5.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use). Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Inform patients that liraglutide causes benign and malignant thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats and that the human relevance of this finding is unknown. Counsel patients to report symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a lump in the neck, hoarseness, dysphagia, or dyspnea) to their physician [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Pancreatitis Inform patients of the potential risk for pancreatitis. Explain that persistent severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to discontinue liraglutide promptly and contact their physician if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients Advise patients that they must never share a liraglutide injection pen with another person, even if the needle is changed, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Hypoglycemia Inform patients that hypoglycemia has been reported when liraglutide is used with insulin secretagogues or insulin and may occur in pediatric patients regardless of concomitant antidiabetic treatment. Educate patients or caregivers on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Acute Kidney Injury Advise patients of the potential risk of dehydration due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and to take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. Inform patients of the potential risk for worsening renal function, which in some cases may require dialysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients that serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of liraglutide. Advise patients on the symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and instruct them to stop taking liraglutide and seek medical advice promptly if such symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Acute Gallbladder Disease Inform patients of the potential risk for cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. Instruct patients to contact their physician if cholelithiasis or cholecystitis is suspected for appropriate clinical follow-up [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Missed Dose Inform patients not to take an extra dose of liraglutide to make up for a missed dose. If a dose is missed, the once-daily regimen should be resumed as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last dose, advise the patient to reinitiate liraglutide at 0.6 mg to mitigate any gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment. Liraglutide should be titrated at the discretion of the healthcare provider [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

This may block the injection. \u2022 Keep the dose button pressed down and make sure that you keep the needle under the skin for a full count of 6 seconds to make sure the full dose is injected. Keep your thumb on the injection button until you remove the needle from your skin (See Figure N). \u2022 Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Step I. Withdraw Needle \u2022 You may see a drop of liraglutide at the needle tip. This is normal and it does not affect the dose you just received. If blood appears after you take the needle out of your skin, apply light pressure, but do not rub the area (See Figure O). Step J. Remove and Dispose of the Needle \u2022 Carefully put the outer needle cap over the needle (See Figure P). Unscrew the needle. \u2022 Safely remove the needle from your liraglutide injection pen after each use. \u2022 Put your used liraglutide injection pen and needles in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and pens in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: o made of a heavy-duty plastic o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out o upright and stable during use o leak-resistant o properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. Do not reuse or share your needles with other people. For more information about the safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. \u2022 Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. Caring for your liraglutide injection pen \u2022 After removing the needle, put the pen cap on your liraglutide injection pen and store your liraglutide injection pen without the needle attached (See Figure Q). \u2022 Do not try to refill your liraglutide injection pen \u2013 it is prefilled and is disposable. \u2022 Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart. \u2022 Keep your liraglutide injection pen away from dust, dirt and liquids. \u2022 If cleaning is needed, wipe the outside of the pen with a clean, damp cloth. How should I store liraglutide injection? Before use: \u2022 Store your new, unused liraglutide injection pen in the refrigerator at 36\u00ba to 46\u00baF (2\u00ba to 8\u00baC). \u2022 If liraglutide injection is stored outside of refrigeration (by mistake) prior to first use, it should be used or thrown away within 30 days. \u2022 Do not freeze liraglutide injection or use liraglutide injection if it has been frozen. Do not store liraglutide injection near the refrigerator cooling element. Pen in use: \u2022 Use a liraglutide injection pen for only 30 days. Throw away a used liraglutide injection pen 30 days after you start using it, even if some medicine is left in the pen. \u2022 Store your liraglutide injection pen at 59\u00ba to 86\u00baF (15\u00ba to 30\u00baC), or in a refrigerator at 36\u00ba to 46\u00baF (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C). \u2022 When carrying the pen away from home, store the pen at a temperature between 59\u00ba to 86\u00baF (15\u00ba to 30\u00baC). \u2022 If liraglutide injection has been exposed to temperatures above 86\u00baF (30\u00baC), it should be thrown away. \u2022 Protect your liraglutide injection pen from heat and sunlight. \u2022 Keep the pen cap on when your liraglutide injection pen is not in use. \u2022 Always remove the needle after each injection and store your pen without the needle attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage and inaccurate dosing. injection-pen needle-example triangle_1 triangle_2 triangle_3 tirangle_4 triangle_5 triangle_6 tirangle_7 triangle_8 image-a image-b image-c image-d image-e image-f image-g image-h image-i image-j image-k image-l image-m image-n image-o image-p image-q pen_image"

Limitations of Use : Coadministration with other liraglutide-containing products is not recommended."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult Patients : Initiate at 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for one week then increase to 1.2 mg daily. If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dose to 1.8 mg daily after one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg daily dose. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric Patients : Initiate at 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for at least one week. If additional glycemic control is required increase the dose to 1.2 mg daily and if additional glycemic control is still required, increase the dose to 1.8 mg daily after at least one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg daily dose. ( 2.1 ) Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles. ( 2.3 ) Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously once-daily at any time of day, independently of meals, in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. ( 2.3 ) When using liraglutide injection with insulin, administer as separate injections. Never mix. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Adult Patients The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide injection is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for one week. The 0.6 mg once daily dosage is intended to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] during initial titration and is not effective for glycemic control in adults. After one week at the 0.6 mg once daily dosage, increase the dosage to 1.2 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage to the maximum recommended dosage of 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily after at least one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg once daily dosage. Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide injection is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage in 0.6 mg increments after at least one week on the current dosage, to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The maximum recommended dosage is 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. 2.2 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose Instruct patients who miss a dose of liraglutide injection to resume the once daily dosage regimen as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Do not administer an extra dose or increase the dose to make up for the missed dose. If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last liraglutide injection dose, reinitiate liraglutide injection at 0.6 mg once daily to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with reinitiation of treatment. Upon reinitiation, liraglutide injection should be titrated at the discretion of the healthcare provider. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles. Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously once daily at any time of day, independently of meals. Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. No dosage adjustment is needed if changing the injection site and/or timing. Rotate injection sites within the same region in order to reduce the risk of cutaneous amyloidosis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . When using liraglutide injection with insulin, administer as separate injections. Never mix. It is acceptable to inject liraglutide injection and insulin in the same body region but the injections should not be adjacent to each other."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Pancreatitis : Has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide. Discontinue if pancreatitis is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients , even if the needle is changed. (5.3) Hypoglycemia : Adult patients taking an insulin secretagogue or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide regardless of insulin and/or metformin use. Reduction in the dose of insulin secretagogues or insulin may be necessary. (5.4) Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion : Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions that could lead to volume depletion. ( 5.5 ) Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions : Use has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe. Liraglutide injection is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis. ( 5.6 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema). Discontinue liraglutide injection and promptly seek medical advice. ( 5.7 ) Acute Gallbladder Disease : If cholelithiasis or cholecystitis are suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. ( 5.8 ) Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation : Has been reported in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers of any planned surgeries or procedures. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether liraglutide will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and liraglutide use in humans. Liraglutide is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of liraglutide and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated. 5.2 Acute Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . After initiation of liraglutide injection, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis which may include persistent or severe abdominal pain (sometimes radiating to the back) and which may or may not be accompanied by nausea or vomiting. If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue liraglutide injection and initiate appropriate management. 5.3 Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients Liraglutide injection pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Adult patients receiving liraglutide in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide regardless of insulin and/or metformin use. [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications and pediatric patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.5 Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, in some cases requiring hemodialysis, in patients treated with liraglutide [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . The majority of the reported events occurred in patients who experienced gastrointestinal reactions leading to dehydration such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions to liraglutide that could lead to volume depletion, especially during dosage initiation and escalation of liraglutide injection [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.6 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide, has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . In liraglutide injection clinical trials, severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among patients receiving liraglutide (1.2 mg 4.4%, 1.8 mg 4.2%) than placebo (1.1%). Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have also been reported postmarketing with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Liraglutide injection is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with liraglutide [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue liraglutide injection; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with liraglutide. Liraglutide is contraindicated in patients who have had a serious hypersensitivity reaction to liraglutide or any of the excipients in liraglutide injection [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.8 Acute Gallbladder Disease Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated. 5.9 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation Liraglutide delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations. Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking liraglutide injection, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing liraglutide injection could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking liraglutide injection."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information: Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Acute Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Acute Gallbladder Disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655%) in clinical trials are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, dyspepsia, constipation. ( 6.1 ) Immunogenicity-related events, including urticaria, were more common among liraglutide-treated patients (0.8%) than among comparator-treated patients (0.4%) in clinical trials. ( 12.6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-844-824-8426 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Common Adverse Reactions The safety of liraglutide injection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled trials in adults and one trial of 52 weeks duration in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . The data in Table 1 reflect exposure of 1,673 adult patients to liraglutide and a mean duration of exposure to liraglutide of 37.3 weeks. The mean age of adult patients was 58 years, 4% were 75 years or older and 54% were male. The population was 79% White, 6% Black or African American, 13% Asian; 4% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years and a mean HbA 1c of 8.4%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% and moderately impaired in 12% of the pooled population. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions in adults, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of liraglutide injection for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on liraglutide than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with liraglutide. Overall, the type, and severity of adverse reactions in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older and above were comparable to that observed in the adult population. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22655% of Adult Patients Treated with Liraglutide Injection for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Placebo N=661 Liraglutide 1.2 mg N= 645 Liraglutide 1.8 mg N= 1,024 Adverse Reaction (%) (%) (%) Nausea 5 18 20 Diarrhea 4 10 12 Headache 7 11 10 Nasopharyngitis 8 9 10 Vomiting 2 6 9 Decreased appetite 1 10 9 Dyspepsia 1 4 7 Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 6 7 6 Constipation 1 5 5 Back Pain 3 4 5 Cumulative proportions were calculated combining studies using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weights. In an analysis of placebo- and active-controlled trials, the types and frequency of common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, were similar to those listed in Table 1 . Other Adverse Reactions Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions In the pool of 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled adult clinical trials, withdrawals due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions, occurred in 4.3% of liraglutide-treated patients and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among patients receiving liraglutide (1.2 mg 4.4 %, 1.8 mg 4.2 %) than placebo (1.1 %). Withdrawal due to gastrointestinal adverse events mainly occurred during the first 2 to 3 months of the trials. Injection site reactions Injection site reactions (e.g., injection site rash, erythema) were reported in approximately 2% of liraglutide-treated adult patients in the five double-blind, glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration. Less than 0.2% of liraglutide-treated patients discontinued due to injection site reactions. Hypoglycemia In 5 adult glycemic control, placebo-controlled clinical trials of at least 26 weeks duration, hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person for treatment occurred in 8 liraglutide-treated patients (7.5 events per 1,000 patient-years). Of these 8 liraglutide-treated patients, 7 patients were concomitantly using a sulfonylurea. Table 2.

In a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with a 26-week open-label extension, 21.2% of liraglutide-treated patients (mean age 14.6 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus, had hypoglycemia with a blood glucose <54 mg/dL with or without symptoms (335 events per 1,000 patient years). No severe hypoglycemic episodes occurred in the liraglutide treatment group (severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions). Papillary thyroid carcinoma In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there were 7 reported cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma in patients treated with liraglutide and 1 case in a comparator-treated patient (1.5 vs. 0.5 cases per 1,000 patient-years). Most of these papillary thyroid carcinomas were <1 cm in greatest diameter and were diagnosed in surgical pathology specimens after thyroidectomy prompted by findings on protocol-specified screening with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound. Pancreatitis In glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there have been 13 cases of pancreatitis among liraglutide-treated patients and 1 case in a comparator (glimepiride) treated patient (2.7 vs. 0.5 cases per 1,000 patient-years). Nine of the 13 cases with liraglutide were reported as acute pancreatitis and four were reported as chronic pancreatitis. In one case in a liraglutide-treated patient, pancreatitis, with necrosis, was observed and led to death; however clinical causality could not be established. Some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, the incidence of cholelithiasis was 0.3% in both liraglutide-treated and placebo-treated patients. The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.2% in both liraglutide-treated and placebo-treated patients. Laboratory Tests Bilirubin In the five adult glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration, mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (elevations to no more than twice the upper limit of the reference range) occurred in 4% of liraglutide-treated patients, 2.1% of placebo-treated patients and 3.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. This finding was not accompanied by abnormalities in other liver tests. The significance of this isolated finding is unknown. Calcitonin Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program. At the end of the adult glycemic control trials, adjusted mean serum calcitonin concentrations were higher in liraglutide-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients but not compared to patients receiving active comparator. Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less. Among adult patients with pretreatment calcitonin <20 ng/L, calcitonin elevations to >20 ng/L occurred in 0.7% of liraglutide-treated patients, 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, and 0.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Lipase and Amylase In one adult glycemic control trial in renal impairment patients, a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed for liraglutide-treated patients while placebo-treated patients had a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with liraglutide is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Vital signs Liraglutide injection did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed in adult patients treated with liraglutide compared to placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of liraglutide injection. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal: Acute pancreatitis; hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis sometimes resulting in death; ileus, intestinal obstruction, severe constipation including fecal impaction, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea leading to dehydration Hepatobiliary: Elevations of liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy, hepatitis Hypersensitivity: Angioedema, anaphylactic reactions, pruritus Neoplasms: Medullary thyroid carcinoma Neurologic: Dysgeusia, dizziness, dysesthesia Pulmonary: Pulmonary aspiration has occurred in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation. Renal: Acute renal failure or worsening of chronic renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis; and increased serum creatinine Skin and subcutaneous tissue: Cutaneous amyloidosis, alopecia"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Effects of delayed gastric emptying on oral medications : Liraglutide delays gastric emptying and may impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. ( 7 ) 7.1 Effects of Delayed Gastric Emptying on Oral Medications Liraglutide causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials, liraglutide injection did not affect the absorption of the tested orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with liraglutide injection. 7.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin Liraglutide stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. Patients receiving liraglutide in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. When initiating liraglutide injection, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Liraglutide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to liraglutide during pregnancy. Liraglutide injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal reproduction studies identified increased adverse developmental outcomes from exposure during pregnancy. Liraglutide exposure was associated with early embryonic deaths and an imbalance in some fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats administered liraglutide during organogenesis at doses that approximate clinical exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.8 mg/day. In pregnant rabbits administered liraglutide during organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of major fetal abnormalities were seen at exposures below the human exposures at the MRHD ( see Animal Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects for women with uncontrolled pre-gestational diabetes (Hemoglobin A 1c >7) is 6 to 10%. The major birth defect rate has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a Hemoglobin A 1c >10. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Animal Data Female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide beginning 2 weeks before mating through gestation day 17 had estimated systemic exposures 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times the human exposure at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. The number of early embryonic deaths in the 1 mg/kg/day group increased slightly. Fetal abnormalities and variations in kidneys and blood vessels, irregular ossification of the skull, and a more complete state of ossification occurred at all doses. Mottled liver and minimally kinked ribs occurred at the highest dose. The incidence of fetal malformations in liraglutide-treated groups exceeding concurrent and historical controls were misshapen oropharynx and/or narrowed opening into larynx at 0.1 mg/kg/day and umbilical hernia at 0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg/day. Pregnant rabbits given subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through day 18 inclusive, had estimated systemic exposures less than the human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day at all doses, based on plasma AUC. Liraglutide decreased fetal weight and dose-dependently increased the incidence of total major fetal abnormalities at all doses. The incidence of malformations exceeded concurrent and historical controls at 0.01 mg/kg/day (kidneys, scapula), \u22650.01 mg/kg/day (eyes, forelimb), 0.025 mg/kg/day (brain, tail and sacral vertebrae, major blood vessels and heart, umbilicus), \u22650.025 mg/kg/day (sternum) and at 0.05 mg/kg/day (parietal bones, major blood vessels). Irregular ossification and/or skeletal abnormalities occurred in the skull and jaw, vertebrae and ribs, sternum, pelvis, tail, and scapula; and dose-dependent minor skeletal variations were observed. Visceral abnormalities occurred in blood vessels, lung, liver, and esophagus. Bilobed or bifurcated gallbladder was seen in all treatment groups, but not in the control group. In pregnant female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through weaning or termination of nursing on lactation day 24, estimated systemic exposures were 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day, based on plasma AUC. A slight delay in parturition was observed in the majority of treated rats. Group mean body weight of neonatal rats from liraglutide-treated dams was lower than neonatal rats from control group dams. Bloody scabs and agitated behavior occurred in male rats descended from dams treated with 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide. Group mean body weight from birth to postpartum day 14 trended lower in F 2 generation rats descended from liraglutide-treated rats compared to F 2 generation rats descended from controls, but differences did not reach statistical significance for any group. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of liraglutide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Liraglutide was present in milk of lactating rats ( see Data) . Developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for liraglutide injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liraglutide or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In lactating rats, liraglutide was present unchanged in milk at concentrations approximately 50% of maternal plasma concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide injection as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older. Use of liraglutide injection for this indication is supported by a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial and a 26-week open-label extension in 134 pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a pediatric pharmacokinetic study, and studies in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.2 )] . The risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection in pediatric patients regardless of insulin and/or metformin use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide injection have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the liraglutide treatment arms of the glycemic control trials, a total of 832 (19.3%) of the patients were 65 to 74 years of age and 145 (3.4%) were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . No overall differences in safety or effectiveness for liraglutide injection have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of liraglutide injection is recommended for patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The safety and efficacy of liraglutide injection was evaluated in a 26-week clinical study that included patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. There is limited experience with liraglutide injection in patients with end stage renal disease. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There is limited experience in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, liraglutide injection should be used with caution in this patient population. No dose adjustment of liraglutide injection is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Liraglutide Injection contains liraglutide, an analog of human GLP-1 and acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist. The peptide precursor of liraglutide, produced by a process that includes expression of recombinant DNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , has been engineered to be 97% homologous to native human GLP-1 by substituting arginine for lysine at position 34. Liraglutide is made by attaching a C-16 fatty acid (palmitic acid) with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26 of the peptide precursor. The molecular formula of liraglutide is C 172 H 265 N 43 O 51 and the molecular weight is 3,751.2 Daltons. The structural formula ( Figure 1 ) is: Figure 1. Structural Formula of Liraglutide Liraglutide Injection is a sterile, aqueous, clear, colorless or almost colorless solution for subcutaneous use. Each 1 mL of Liraglutide Injection solution contains 6 mg of liraglutide and the following inactive ingredients: disodium phosphate dihydrate, 1.42 mg; propylene glycol, 14 mg; phenol, 5.5 mg; and water for injection. Liraglutide Injection has a pH of approximately 8.15, hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH. Each prefilled pen contains a 3 mL solution of Liraglutide Injection equivalent to 18 mg liraglutide (free-base, anhydrous). Structural Formula"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Liraglutide is an acylated human GLP-1 receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37). GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5 to 2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-4 and NEP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide\u2019s pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide injection lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) liraglutide on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single dose of liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide injection on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. Figure 2 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to 12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide injection is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide in pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 kg to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with R enal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5-6) to severe (Child Pugh score >9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide (8 h to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The coadministration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide. Atorvastatin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide. Acetaminophen Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1,000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following coadministration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide injection at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Liraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those with liraglutide injection or other liraglutide products. A subset of liraglutide-treated patients (1,104 of 2,501, 44%) in five adult double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] and 102/1,104 (9%) of liraglutide-treated patients developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Of these 102 liraglutide-treated patients, 56 (5%) patients developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 12 (1%) of the liraglutide-treated patients. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-liraglutide antibodies on effectiveness of liraglutide injection. In five double-blind adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of liraglutide-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for liraglutide-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. In a clinical trial with pediatric patients aged 10 years and older [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] , anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 1 (2%) liraglutide treated patient at week 26 and 5 (9%) liraglutide treated patients at week 53. None of the 5 patients had antibodies cross reactive to native GLP-1 or had neutralizing antibodies."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Liraglutide is an acylated human GLP-1 receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37). GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5 to 2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-4 and NEP."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide\u2019s pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide injection lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) liraglutide on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single dose of liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide injection on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. Figure 2"

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to 12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide injection is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide in pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 kg to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with R enal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5-6) to severe (Child Pugh score >9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide (8 h to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The coadministration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide. Atorvastatin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide. Acetaminophen Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1,000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following coadministration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide injection at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Liraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

A dose-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in the 1 and the 3 mg/kg/day groups with incidences of 13% and 19% in males and 6% and 20% in females, respectively. C-cell adenomas did not occur in control groups or 0.03 and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. Treatment-related malignant C-cell carcinomas occurred in 3% of females in the 3.0 mg/kg/day group. Thyroid C-cell tumors are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in mice. A treatment-related increase in fibrosarcomas was seen on the dorsal skin and subcutis, the body surface used for drug injection, in males in the 3 mg/kg/day group. These fibrosarcomas were attributed to the high local concentration of drug near the injection site. The liraglutide concentration in the clinical formulation (6 mg per mL) is 10-times higher than the concentration in the formulation used to administer 3 mg/kg/day liraglutide to mice in the carcinogenicity study (0.6 mg per mL). A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0.075, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection with exposures 0.5-, 2- and 8-times the human exposure, respectively, resulting from the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. A treatment-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in males in 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide groups with incidences of 12%, 16%, 42%, and 46% and in all female liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 10%, 27%, 33%, and 56% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. A treatment-related increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in all male liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 2%, 8%, 6%, and 14% and in females at 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day with incidences of 0%, 0%, 4%, and 6% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. Thyroid C-cell carcinomas are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in rats. Studies in mice demonstrated that liraglutide-induced C-cell proliferation was dependent on the GLP-1 receptor and that liraglutide did not cause activation of the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene in thyroid C-cells. Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats is unknown and has not been determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Liraglutide was negative with and without metabolic activation in the Ames test for mutagenicity and in a human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test for clastogenicity. Liraglutide was negative in repeat-dose in vivo micronucleus tests in rats. In rat fertility studies using subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating until gestation day 17. No direct adverse effects on male fertility was observed at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day, a high dose yielding an estimated systemic exposure 11-times the human exposure at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC. In female rats, an increase in early embryonic deaths occurred at 1 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain and food consumption were observed in females at the 1 mg/kg/day dose."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In glycemic control trials in adults, liraglutide injection has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with one or two oral anti-diabetic medications or basal insulin. In each of the placebo controlled trials, treatment with liraglutide produced clinically and statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A 1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo. All liraglutide-treated patients started at 0.6 mg/day. The dose was increased in weekly intervals by 0.6 mg to reach 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg for patients randomized to these higher doses. Liraglutide 0.6 mg is not effective for glycemic control and is intended only as a starting dose to reduce gastrointestinal intolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2 )] . Monotherapy In this 52-week trial, 746 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide 1.2 mg, liraglutide 1.8 mg, or glimepiride 8 mg. Patients who were randomized to glimepiride were initially treated with 2 mg daily for two weeks, increasing to 4 mg daily for another two weeks, and finally increasing to 8 mg daily. Treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg and 1.2 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c compared to glimepiride ( Table 3 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.6% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg treatment group, 6% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg treatment group, and 10.1% in the glimepiride-treatment group. The mean age of participants was 53 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 5 years. Participants were 49.7% male, 77.5% White, 12.6% Black or African American and 35% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.1 kg/m 2 . Table 3.

Randomization occurred after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week initial forced metformin titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin were increased up to 2,000 mg/day. Treatment with liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to metformin resulted in a significant mean HbA 1c reduction relative to placebo add-on to metformin and resulted in a similar mean HbA 1c reduction relative to glimepiride 4 mg add-on to metformin ( Table 4 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 5.4% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin treatment group, 3.3% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg + metformin treatment group, 23.8% in the placebo + metformin treatment group, and 3.7% in the glimepiride + metformin treated group.

Patients were to continue their current treatment on metformin at a stable, pre-trial dose level and dosing frequency. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 6 years. Participants were 52.9% male, 86.6% White, 7.2% Black or African American and 16.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.8 kg/m 2 . The primary endpoint was the change in HbA 1c from baseline to Week 26. Treatment with liraglutide 1.2 mg and liraglutide 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c relative to sitagliptin 100 mg ( Table 5 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.1% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg group, 0.5% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg treatment group, and 4.1% in the sitagliptin 100 mg treatment group. From a mean baseline body weight of 94 kg, there was a mean reduction of 2.7 kg for liraglutide 1.2 mg, 3.3 kg for liraglutide 1.8 mg, and 0.8 kg for sitagliptin 100 mg. Table 5.

Mean HbA 1c for Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who Completed the 26-week Trial and for the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF, intent-to-treat) Data at Week 26 Combination Therapy with Metformin and Insulin This 26-week open-label trial enrolled 988 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control (HbA 1c 7 to 10%) on metformin (\u22651,500 mg/day) alone or inadequate glycemic control (HbA 1c 7 to 8.5%) on metformin (\u22651,500 mg/day) and a sulfonylurea. Patients who were on metformin and a sulfonylurea discontinued the sulfonylurea then all patients entered a 12-week run-in period during which they received add-on therapy with liraglutide titrated to 1.8 mg once-daily. At the end of the run-in period, 498 patients (50%) achieved HbA 1c <7% with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin and continued treatment in a non-randomized, observational arm. Another 167 patients (17%) withdrew from the trial during the run-in period with approximately one-half of these patients doing so because of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The remaining 323 patients with HbA 1c \u22657% (33% of those who entered the run-in period) were randomized to 26 weeks of once-daily insulin detemir administered in the evening as add-on therapy (N=162) or to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin (N=161). The starting dose of insulin detemir was 10 units/day and the mean dose at the end of the 26-week randomized period was 39 units/day. During the 26 week randomized treatment period, the percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 11.2% in the group randomized to continued treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin and 1.2% in the group randomized to add-on therapy with insulin detemir. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 55.7% male, 91.3% White, 5.6% Black or African American and 12.5% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 34 kg/m 2 . Treatment with insulin detemir as add-on to liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG compared to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin alone ( Table 6 ). From a mean baseline body weight of 96 kg after randomization, there was a mean reduction of 0.3 kg in the patients who received insulin detemir add-on therapy compared to a mean reduction of 1.1 kg in the patients who continued on unchanged treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin alone.

Randomization occurred after a 4-week run-in period consisting of an initial, 2-week, forced-glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 2 weeks. During the titration period, doses of glimepiride were increased to 4 mg/day. The doses of glimepiride could be reduced (at the discretion of the investigator) from 4 mg/day to 3 mg/day or 2 mg/day (minimum) after randomization, in the event of unacceptable hypoglycemia or other adverse events. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 49.4% male, 64.4% White and 2.8% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 29.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride ( Table 7 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 3.5% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 17.5% in the placebo + glimepiride treatment group, and 6.9% in the rosiglitazone + glimepiride treatment group.

Randomization took place after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week forced metformin and glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin and glimepiride were to be increased up to 2,000 mg/day and 4 mg/day, respectively. After randomization, patients randomized to liraglutide 1.8 mg underwent a 2 week period of titration with liraglutide. During the trial, the liraglutide and metformin doses were fixed, although glimepiride and insulin glargine doses could be adjusted. Patients titrated glargine twice-weekly during the first 8 weeks of treatment based on self-measured fasting plasma glucose on the day of titration. After Week 8, the frequency of insulin glargine titration was left to the discretion of the investigator, but, at a minimum, the glargine dose was to be revised, if necessary, at Weeks 12 and 18. Only 20% of glargine-treated patients achieved the pre-specified target fasting plasma glucose of \u2264100 mg/dL. Therefore, optimal titration of the insulin glargine dose was not achieved in most patients. The mean age of participants was 58 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 56.5% male, 75.0% White and 3.6% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 30.5 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide as add-on to glimepiride and metformin resulted in a statistically significant mean reduction in HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride and metformin ( Table 8 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 0.9% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, 0.4% in the insulin glargine + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, and 11.3% in the placebo + metformin + glimepiride treatment group.

Maximally tolerated doses of background therapy were to remain unchanged for the duration of the trial. Patients randomized to exenatide started on a dose of 5 mcg twice-daily for 4 weeks and then were escalated to 10 mcg twice-daily. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 51.9% male, 91.8% White, 5.4% Black or African American and 12.3% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG relative to exenatide ( Table 9 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued for ineffective therapy was 0.4% in the liraglutide treatment group and 0% in the exenatide treatment group. Both treatment groups had a mean decrease from baseline in body weight of approximately 3 kg. Table 9.

Patients underwent a 9 week run-in period (3-week forced dose escalation followed by a 6-week dose maintenance phase) with rosiglitazone (starting at 4 mg and increasing to 8 mg/day within 2 weeks) and metformin (starting at 500 mg with increasing weekly increments of 500 mg to a final dose of 2,000 mg/day). Only patients who tolerated the final dose of rosiglitazone (8 mg/day) and metformin (2,000 mg/day) and completed the 6-week dose maintenance phase were eligible for randomization into the trial. The mean age of participants was 55 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 61.6% male, 84.2% White, 10.2% Black or African American and 16.4% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide as add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone produced a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone ( Table 10 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 1.7% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, 1.7% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, and 16.4% in the placebo + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group.

Liraglutide was added to the patient\u2019s stable pre-trial antidiabetic regimen (insulin therapy and/or metformin, pioglitazone, or sulfonylurea). The dose of liraglutide injection was escalated according to approved labeling to achieve a dose of 1.8 mg per day. The insulin dose was reduced by 20% at randomization for patients with baseline HbA 1c \u22648% and fixed until liraglutide dose escalation was complete. Dose reduction of insulin and SU was allowed in case of hypoglycemia; up titration of insulin was allowed but not beyond the pre-trial dose. The mean age of participants was 67 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Participants were 50.5% male, 92.3% White, 6.6% Black or African American, and 7.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 . Approximately half of patients had an eGFR between 30 and <45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c from baseline at Week 26 compared to placebo (see Table 11 ). 123 patients reached the 1.8 mg dose of liraglutide.

Patients were randomized to liraglutide once-daily or placebo once-daily in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin treatment. All patients were on a metformin dose of 1,000 to 2,000 mg prior to randomization. The basal insulin dose was decreased by 20% at randomization and liraglutide was titrated weekly by 0.6 mg for 2 to 3 weeks based on tolerability and an average fasting plasma glucose goal of \u2264110 mg/dL. The mean age was 14.6 years: 29.9% were ages 10-14 years, and 70.1% were greater than 14 years of age. 38.1% were male, 64.9% were White, 13.4% were Asian, 11.9% were Black or African American; 29.1% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 and the mean BMI SDS was 2.9. 18.7% of patients were using basal insulin at baseline. The mean duration of diabetes was 1.9 years and the mean HbA 1c was 7.8%. At week 26, treatment with liraglutide was superior in reducing HbA 1c from baseline versus placebo. The estimated treatment difference in HbA 1c reduction from baseline between liraglutide and placebo was -1.06% with a 95% confidence interval of [-1.65%; -0.46%] (see Table 12 ). Table 12.

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Liraglutide Injection If you are having problems using your Liraglutide Injection pen, call toll free 1-844-824-8426 or visit www.meithealpharma.com. First read the Medication Guide that comes with your Liraglutide Injection single-patient-use pen and then read this Instructions for Use for information about how to use your Liraglutide Injection pen the right way. These instructions do not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Do not share your Liraglutide Injection pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. Your Liraglutide Injection pen is a disposable single-patient-use pre-filled pen injector that contains 3 mL of Liraglutide Injection and will deliver doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg. The number of doses that you can take with a Liraglutide Injection pen depends on the dose of medicine that is prescribed for you. Your healthcare provider will tell you how much Liraglutide Injection to take. Talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist for more information about needles for your Liraglutide Injection pen. Important Information \u0394 Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \u0394 Always remove the needle after each injection, and store your pen without the needle attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of liraglutide, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. \u0394 Keep your Liraglutide Injection pen and all medicines out of the reach of children. \u0394 If you drop your Liraglutide Injection pen, repeat \u201c First Time Use For Each New Pen \u201d (steps A through D). \u0394 Be careful not to bend or damage the needle. \u0394 Do not use the cartridge scale to measure how much Liraglutide Injection to inject. \u0394 Be careful when handling used needles to avoid needle stick injuries. \u0394 You can use your Liraglutide Injection pen for up to 30 days after you use it the first time. Supplies you will need to give your Liraglutide Injection: Liraglutide Injection pen a new disposable needle alcohol swab cotton ball or gauze sharps disposal container for throwing away used Liraglutide Injection pens and needles. See \u201cRemove and Dispose of the Needle\u201d at the end of these instructions. First Time Use for Each New Pen Step A. Check the Pen Take your new Liraglutide Injection pen out of the refrigerator. Wash hands with soap and water before use. Check pen label before each use to make sure it is your Liraglutide Injection pen. Pull off pen cap (See Figure A). Check Liraglutide Injection in the cartridge. The liquid should be clear, colorless and free of particles. If not, do not use. Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab. Step B. Attach the Needle Remove protective tab from outer needle cap. Push outer needle cap containing the needle straight onto the pen, then screw needle on until secure. (See Figure B ). Pull off outer needle cap. (See Figure C ). Do not throw away. Pull off inner needle cap and throw away. (See Figure D ). A small drop of liquid may appear. This is normal. Step C. Dial to the Flow Check Symbol This step is done only One Time for each new pen and is Only required the first time you use a new pen. Turn dose selector until the black line in front of flow check symbol ( ) appears centered within the notch in the dose display (See Figure E). The flow check symbol does not administer the dose as prescribed by your healthcare provider. To select the dose prescribed by your healthcare provider, continue to Step G under \u201c Routine Use \u201d. Step D. Prepare the Pen Hold pen with needle pointing up. Tap cartridge gently with your finger a few times to bring any air bubbles to the top of the cartridge (See Figure F ). Keep needle pointing up and press dose button until the black line in front of 0 appears centered within the notch in the dose display (See Figure G ). Repeat steps C and D , up to 6 times, until a drop of Liraglutide Injection appears at the needle tip. If you still see no drop of Liraglutide Injection, use a new pen and contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals at 1-844-824-8426. Continue to Step G under \"Routine Use\" \u2192 Routine Use Step E. Check the Pen Take your Liraglutide Injection pen from where it is stored. Wash hands with soap and water before use. Check pen label before each use to make sure it is your Liraglutide Injection pen. Pull off pen cap (See Figure H ). Check Liraglutide Injection in the cartridge. The liquid should be clear, colorless and free of particles. If not, do not use. Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab. Step F. Attach the Needle Remove protective tab from outer needle cap. Push outer needle cap containing the needle straight onto the pen, then screw needle on until secure (See Figure I ). Pull off outer needle cap. Do not throw away (See Figure J ). Pull off inner needle cap and throw away (See Figure K ). A small drop of liquid may appear. This is normal. Step G. Dial the Dose Liraglutide Injection pen can give a dose of 0.6 mg (starting dose), 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg. Be sure that you know the dose of Liraglutide Injection that is prescribed for you. Turn the dose selector until the black line in front of your needed dose appears centered within the notch in the dose display (0.6 mg, 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg) (See Figure L ). You will hear a \"click\" every time you turn the dose selector. Do not set the dose by counting the number of clicks you hear. If you select a wrong dose, change it by turning the dose selector backwards or forwards until the black line in front of the correct dose appears centered within the notch in the dose display. Be careful not to press the dose button when turning the dose selector. This may cause Liraglutide Injection to come out. Step H. Injecting the Dose Choose your injection site in either the stomach (abdomen), thigh, or upper arm (only if caregiver administered) and wipe the skin with an alcohol swab (See Figure M ). Let the injection site dry before you inject your dose. Insert needle into your skin using the injection technique shown to you by your healthcare provider. Do not inject Liraglutide Injection into a vein or muscle. Press down on the center of the dose button to inject until the black line in front of 0 appears centered within the notch in the dose display (See Figure N ). Be careful not to touch the dose display with your other fingers. This may block the injection. Keep the dose button pressed down and make sure that you keep the needle under the skin for a full count of 6 seconds to make sure the full dose is injected. Keep your thumb on the injection button until you remove the needle from your skin (See Figure O ). Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Step I. Withdraw Needle You may see a drop of Liraglutide Injection at the needle tip. This is normal and it does not affect the dose you just received. If blood appears after you take the needle out of your skin, apply light pressure with a cotton ball or gauze, but do not rub the area (See Figure P ). Step J. Remove and Dispose of the Needle Carefully put the outer needle cap over the needle (See Figure Q ). Unscrew the needle. Safely remove the needle from your Liraglutide Injection pen after each use. Put your used Liraglutide Injection pen and needles in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and pens in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out upright and stable during use leak-resistant properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. Do not reuse or share your needles with other people. For more information about the safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. Caring for your Liraglutide Injection pen After removing the needle, put the pen cap on your Liraglutide Injection pen and store your Liraglutide Injection pen without the needle attached (See Figure R ). Do not try to refill your Liraglutide Injection pen - it is pre-filled and is disposable. Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart. Keep your Liraglutide Injection pen away from dust, dirt and liquids. If cleaning is needed, wipe the outside of the pen with a clean, damp cloth. How should I store Liraglutide Injection? Before use: Store your new, unused Liraglutide Injection pen in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C). If Liraglutide Injection is stored outside of refrigeration (by mistake) prior to first use, it should be used or thrown away within 30 days. Do not freeze Liraglutide Injection or use Liraglutide Injection if it has been frozen. Do not store Liraglutide Injection near the refrigerator cooling element. Pen in use: Use a Liraglutide Injection pen for only 30 days. Throw away a used Liraglutide Injection pen 30 days after you start using it, even if some medicine is left in the pen. Store your Liraglutide Injection pen at room temperature between 59\u00b0 to 86\u00b0F (15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C), or in a refrigerator between 36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C). When carrying the pen away from home, store the pen at room temperature between 59\u00b0 to 86\u00b0F (15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C). If Liraglutide Injection has been exposed to temperatures above 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C), it should be thrown away. Protect your Liraglutide Injection pen from heat and sunlight. Keep the pen cap on when your Liraglutide Injection pen is not in use. Always remove the needle after each injection and store your pen without the needle attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage and inaccurate dosing. meitheal \u00ae Mfd. for Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Chicago, IL 60631 (USA) \u00a92025 Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Inc.

If additional glycemic control is required increase the dose to 1.2 mg daily and if additional glycemic control is still required, increase the dose to 1.8 mg daily after at least one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg daily dose (2.1) . \u2022 Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles (2.3) . \u2022 Inject liraglutide subcutaneously once-daily at any time of day, independently of meals, in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm (2.3) . \u2022 When using liraglutide with insulin, administer as separate injections. Never mix. (2.3) . 2.1 Recommended Dosage Adult Patients \u2022 The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for one week. The 0.6 mg once daily dosage is intended to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] during initial titration and is not effective for glycemic control in adults. \u2022 After one week at the 0.6 mg once daily dosage, increase the dosage to 1.2 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. \u2022 If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage to the maximum recommended dosage of 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily after at least one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg once daily dosage. Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older \u2022 The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. \u2022 If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage in 0.6 mg increments after at least one week on the current dosage. \u2022 The maximum recommended dosage is 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. 2.2 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose \u2022 Instruct patients who miss a dose of liraglutide to resume the once-daily dosage regimen as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Do not administer an extra dose or increase the dose to make up for the missed dose. \u2022 If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last liraglutide dose, reinitiate liraglutide at 0.6 mg once daily to mitigate any gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment. Upon reinitiation, liraglutide should be titrated at the discretion of the healthcare provider. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions \u2022 Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles. \u2022 Inject liraglutide subcutaneously once daily at any time of day, independently of meals. \u2022 Inject liraglutide subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. No dosage adjustment is needed if changing the injection site and/or timing. \u2022 Rotate injection sites within the same region in order to reduce the risk of cutaneous amyloidosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. \u2022 When using liraglutide with insulin, administer as separate injections. Never mix. It is acceptable to inject liraglutide and insulin in the same body region but the injections should not be adjacent to each other."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Pancreatitis : Postmarketing reports, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. Discontinue promptly if pancreatitis is suspected. Do not restart if pancreatitis is confirmed (5.2) . \u2022 Never share a liraglutide pen between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.3) . \u2022 Hypoglycemia: Adult patients taking an insulin secretagogue or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide regardless of insulin and/or metformin use. Reduction in the dose of insulin secretagogues or insulin may be necessary (5.4) . \u2022 Acute Kidney Injury : Postmarketing, usually in association with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration which may sometimes require hemodialysis. Use caution when initiating or escalating doses of liraglutide in patients with renal impairment (5.5) . \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions : Postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema). Discontinue liraglutide and promptly seek medical advice (5.6) . \u2022 Acute Gallbladder Disease : If cholelithiasis or cholecystitis are suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated (5.7) . 5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether liraglutide will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and liraglutide use in humans. Liraglutide is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of liraglutide and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated. 5.2 Pancreatitis Based on spontaneous postmarketing reports, acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with liraglutide. After initiation of liraglutide, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, liraglutide should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, liraglutide should not be restarted. In glycemic control trials of liraglutide, there have been 13 cases of pancreatitis among liraglutide-treated patients and 1 case in a comparator (glimepiride) treated patient (2.7 vs. 0.5 cases per 1000 patient-years). Nine of the 13 cases with liraglutide were reported as acute pancreatitis and four were reported as chronic pancreatitis. In one case in a liraglutide-treated patient, pancreatitis, with necrosis, was observed and led to death; however clinical causality could not be established. Some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse. Liraglutide has been studied in a limited number of patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown if patients with a history of pancreatitis are at higher risk for development of pancreatitis on liraglutide. 5.3 Never Share a Liraglutide Pen Between Patients Liraglutide pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Adult patients receiving liraglutide in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide regardless of insulin and/or metformin use. [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications and pediatric patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.5 Acute Kidney Injury Liraglutide has not been found to be directly nephrotoxic in animal studies or clinical trials. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis in liraglutide-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Some of the reported events occurred in patients receiving one or more medications known to affect renal function or hydration status. Altered renal function has been reversed in many of the reported cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including liraglutide. Use caution when initiating or escalating doses of liraglutide in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with liraglutide [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue liraglutide; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with liraglutide. Liraglutide is contraindicated in patients who have had a serious hypersensitivity reaction to liraglutide or any of the excipients in liraglutide [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Acute Gallbladder Disease Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing. In the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , 3.1% of liraglutide-treated patients versus 1.9% of placebo-treated patients reported an acute event of gallbladder disease, such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information: \u2022 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Acute Kidney Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Acute Gallbladder Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655%) in clinical trials are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, dyspepsia, constipation (6.1) . \u2022 Immunogenicity-related events, including urticaria, were more common among liraglutide-treated patients (0.8%) than among comparator-treated patients (0.4%) in clinical trials (12.6) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Common Adverse Reactions The safety of liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled trials in adults and one trial of 52 weeks duration in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The data in Table 1 reflect exposure of 1,673 adult patients to liraglutide and a mean duration of exposure to liraglutide of 37.3 weeks. The mean age of adult patients was 58 years, 4% were 75 years or older and 54% were male. The population was 79% White, 6% Black or African American, 13% Asian; 4% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years and a mean HbA 1c of 8.4%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% and moderately impaired in 12% of the pooled population. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions in adults, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of liraglutide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on liraglutide than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with liraglutide. Overall, the type, and severity of adverse reactions in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older and above were comparable to that observed in the adult population. Table 1. Adverse reactions reported in \u22655% of Adult Patients Treated with Liraglutide for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Placebo N=661 Liraglutide 1.2 mg N=645 Liraglutide 1.8 mg N=1024 Adverse Reaction (%) (%) (%) Nausea 5 18 20 Diarrhea 4 10 12 Headache 7 11 10 Nasopharyngitis 8 9 10 Vomiting 2 6 9 Decreased appetite 1 10 9 Dyspepsia 1 4 7 Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 6 7 6 Constipation 1 5 5 Back Pain 3 4 5 Cumulative proportions were calculated combining studies using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weights. In an analysis of placebo- and active-controlled trials, the types and frequency of common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, were similar to those listed in Table 1 . Other Adverse Reactions Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions In the pool of 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled adult clinical trials, withdrawals due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions, occurred in 4.3% of liraglutide-treated patients and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Withdrawal due to gastrointestinal adverse events mainly occurred during the first 2 to 3 months of the trials. Injection site reactions Injection site reactions (e.g., injection site rash, erythema) were reported in approximately 2% of liraglutide-treated adult patients in the five double-blind, glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration. Less than 0.2% of liraglutide-treated patients discontinued due to injection site reactions. Hypoglycemia In 5 adult glycemic control, placebo-controlled clinical trials of at least 26 weeks duration, hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person for treatment occurred in 8 liraglutide-treated patients (7.5 events per 1000 patient-years). Of these 8 liraglutide-treated patients, 7 patients were concomitantly using a sulfonylurea. Table 2.

In a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with a 26-week open-label extension, 21.2% of liraglutide-treated patients (mean age 14.6 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus, had hypoglycemia with a blood glucose <54 mg/dL with or without symptoms (335 events per 1000 patient years). No severe hypoglycemic episodes occurred in the liraglutide treatment group (severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions). Papillary thyroid carcinoma In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide, there were 7 reported cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma in patients treated with liraglutide and 1 case in a comparator-treated patient (1.5 vs. 0.5 cases per 1000 patient-years). Most of these papillary thyroid carcinomas were <1 cm in greatest diameter and were diagnosed in surgical pathology specimens after thyroidectomy prompted by findings on protocol-specified screening with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide, the incidence of cholelithiasis was 0.3% in both liraglutide-treated and placebo-treated patients. The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.2% in both liraglutide-treated and placebo-treated patients. In the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , the incidence of cholelithiasis was 1.5% (3.9 cases per 1000 patient years of observation) in adult liraglutide-treated and 1.1% (2.8 cases per 1000 patient years of observation) in placebo-treated patients, both on a background of standard of care. The incidence of acute cholecystitis was 1.1% (2.9 cases per 1000 patient years of observation) in adult liraglutide-treated and 0.7% (1.9 cases per 1000 patient years of observation) in placebo-treated patients. The majority of events required hospitalization or cholecystectomy. Laboratory Tests Bilirubin In the five adult glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration, mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (elevations to no more than twice the upper limit of the reference range) occurred in 4.0% of liraglutide-treated patients, 2.1% of placebo-treated patients and 3.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. This finding was not accompanied by abnormalities in other liver tests. The significance of this isolated finding is unknown. Calcitonin Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program. At the end of the adult glycemic control trials, adjusted mean serum calcitonin concentrations were higher in liraglutide-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients but not compared to patients receiving active comparator. Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less. Among adult patients with pretreatment calcitonin <20 ng/L, calcitonin elevations to >20 ng/L occurred in 0.7% of liraglutide-treated patients, 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, and 0.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Lipase and Amylase In one adult glycemic control trial in renal impairment patients, a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed for liraglutide-treated patients while placebo-treated patients had a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%. In the LEADER trial, serum lipase and amylase were routinely measured. Among adult liraglutide-treated patients, 7.9% had a lipase value at any time during treatment of greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal compared with 4.5% of placebo-treated patients, and 1% of liraglutide-treated patients had an amylase value at any time during treatment of greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal versus 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with liraglutide is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Vital signs Liraglutide did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed in adult patients treated with liraglutide compared to placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of liraglutide. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Gastrointestinal: Acute pancreatitis, hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis sometimes resulting in death, ileus \u2022 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Allergic reactions: rash and pruritus \u2022 Hepatobiliary: Elevations of liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy, hepatitis \u2022 Immune system: Angioedema and anaphylactic reactions \u2022 Metabolism and nutrition: Dehydration resulting from nausea, vomiting and diarrhea \u2022 Neoplasms: Medullary thyroid carcinoma \u2022 Nervous system: Dysgeusia, dizziness \u2022 Renal and urinary: Increased serum creatinine, acute renal failure or worsening of chronic renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis. \u2022 Skin and subcutaneous tissue: Cutaneous amyloidosis"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Effects of delayed gastric emptying on oral medications: Liraglutide delays gastric emptying and may impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications (7). 7.1 Effects of Delayed Gastric Emptying on Oral Medications Liraglutide causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials, liraglutide did not affect the absorption of the tested orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with liraglutide. 7.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin Liraglutide stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. Patients receiving liraglutide in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. When initiating liraglutide, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Liraglutide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus (8.1) . 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to liraglutide during pregnancy. Liraglutide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal reproduction studies identified increased adverse developmental outcomes from exposure during pregnancy. Liraglutide exposure was associated with early embryonic deaths and an imbalance in some fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats administered liraglutide during organogenesis at doses that approximate clinical exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.8 mg/day. In pregnant rabbits administered liraglutide during organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of major fetal abnormalities were seen at exposures below the human exposures at the MRHD [see Animal Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects for women with uncontrolled pre-gestational diabetes (Hemoglobin A 1c >7) is 6 to 10%. The major birth defect rate has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a Hemoglobin A 1c >10. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Animal Data Female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide beginning 2 weeks before mating through gestation day 17 had estimated systemic exposures 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times the human exposure at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. The number of early embryonic deaths in the 1 mg/kg/day group increased slightly. Fetal abnormalities and variations in kidneys and blood vessels, irregular ossification of the skull, and a more complete state of ossification occurred at all doses. Mottled liver and minimally kinked ribs occurred at the highest dose. The incidence of fetal malformations in liraglutide-treated groups exceeding concurrent and historical controls were misshapen oropharynx and/or narrowed opening into larynx at 0.1 mg/kg/day and umbilical hernia at 0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg/day. Pregnant rabbits given subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through day 18 inclusive, had estimated systemic exposures less than the human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day at all doses, based on plasma AUC. Liraglutide decreased fetal weight and dose-dependently increased the incidence of total major fetal abnormalities at all doses. The incidence of malformations exceeded concurrent and historical controls at 0.01 mg/kg/day (kidneys, scapula), \u22650.01 mg/kg/day (eyes, forelimb), 0.025 mg/kg/day (brain, tail and sacral vertebrae, major blood vessels and heart, umbilicus), \u22650.025 mg/kg/day (sternum) and at 0.05 mg/kg/day (parietal bones, major blood vessels). Irregular ossification and/or skeletal abnormalities occurred in the skull and jaw, vertebrae and ribs, sternum, pelvis, tail, and scapula; and dose-dependent minor skeletal variations were observed. Visceral abnormalities occurred in blood vessels, lung, liver, and esophagus. Bilobed or bifurcated gallbladder was seen in all treatment groups, but not in the control group. In pregnant female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through weaning or termination of nursing on lactation day 24, estimated systemic exposures were 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day, based on plasma AUC. A slight delay in parturition was observed in the majority of treated rats. Group mean body weight of neonatal rats from liraglutide-treated dams was lower than neonatal rats from control group dams. Bloody scabs and agitated behavior occurred in male rats descended from dams treated with 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide. Group mean body weight from birth to postpartum day 14 trended lower in F 2 generation rats descended from liraglutide-treated rats compared to F 2 generation rats descended from controls, but differences did not reach statistical significance for any group. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of liraglutide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Liraglutide was present in milk of lactating rats [see Data] . Developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for liraglutide and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liraglutide or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In lactating rats, liraglutide was present unchanged in milk at concentrations approximately 50% of maternal plasma concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older. Use of liraglutide for this indication is supported by a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial and a 26-week open-label extension in 134 pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a pediatric pharmacokinetic study, and studies in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.1 , 14.2 )] . The risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide in pediatric patients regardless of insulin and/or metformin use [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the liraglutide treatment arms of the glycemic control trials, a total of 832 (19.3%) of the patients were 65 to 74 years of age and 145 (3.4%) were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . In the liraglutide treatment arm of the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , a total of 1738 (37.2%) patients were 65 to 74 years of age, 401 (8.6%) were 75 to 84 years of age, and 17 (0.4%) were 85 years of age or older at baseline. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness for liraglutide have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of liraglutide is recommended for patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety and efficacy of liraglutide was evaluated in a 26-week clinical study that included patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In the liraglutide treatment arm of the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ], 1932 (41.4%) patients had mild renal impairment, 999 (21.4%) patients had moderate renal impairment and 117 (2.5%) patients had severe renal impairment at baseline. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were seen in these patients compared to patients with normal renal function. There is limited experience with liraglutide in patients with end stage renal disease. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Use caution in patients who experience dehydration. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There is limited experience in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, liraglutide should be used with caution in this patient population. No dose adjustment of liraglutide is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.8 Gastroparesis Liraglutide slows gastric emptying. Liraglutide has not been studied in patients with pre-existing gastroparesis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Liraglutide injection contains liraglutide, an analog of human GLP-1 and acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist. The peptide precursor of liraglutide, produced by a process that includes expression of recombinant DNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been engineered to be 97% homologous to native human GLP-1 by substituting arginine for lysine at position 34. Liraglutide is made by attaching a C-16 fatty acid (palmitic acid) with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26 of the peptide precursor. The molecular formula of liraglutide is C 172 H 265 N 43 O 51 and the molecular weight is 3751.2 Daltons. The structural formula ( Figure 1 ) is: Figure 1. Structural Formula of Liraglutide Liraglutide injection is a sterile, aqueous, clear, colorless or almost colorless solution for subcutaneous use. Each 1 mL of liraglutide injection solution contains 6 mg of liraglutide and the following inactive ingredients: disodium phosphate dihydrate, 1.42 mg; propylene glycol, 14 mg; phenol, 5.5 mg; and water for injection. Liraglutide injection has a pH of approximately 8.15, hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH. Each prefilled pen contains a 3 mL solution of liraglutide equivalent to 18 mg liraglutide (free-base, anhydrous). figure-1"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Liraglutide is an acylated human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37). GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-IV and NEP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide\u2019s pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single-dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) liraglutide on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single-dose of liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. figure-2 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to 12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single-dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single-dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single-dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide in the pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5-6) to severe (Child Pugh score >9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide (8 to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single-dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single-dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The co-administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide. Atorvastatin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single-dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide. Acetaminophen Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single-dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single-dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single-dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Liraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those with liraglutide or other liraglutide products. A subset of liraglutide-treated patients (1104 of 2501, 44%) in five adult double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] and 102/1104 (9%) of liraglutide-treated patients developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Of these 102 liraglutide-treated patients, 56 (5%) patients developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 12 (1%) of the liraglutide-treated patients. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-liraglutide antibodies on effectiveness of liraglutide. In five double-blind adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of liraglutide-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for liraglutide-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. In the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 11 out of the 1247 (0.9%) adult liraglutide-treated patients with antibody measurements. Of the 11 adult liraglutide-treated patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies, none were observed to develop neutralizing antibodies to liraglutide, and 5 patients (0.4%) developed cross-reacting antibodies against native GLP-1. In a clinical trial with pediatric patients aged 10 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ], anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 1 (2%) liraglutide treated patient at week 26 and 5 (9%) liraglutide treated patients at week 53. None of the 5 patients had antibodies cross reactive to native GLP-1 or had neutralizing antibodies."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Liraglutide is an acylated human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37). GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-IV and NEP."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide\u2019s pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single-dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) liraglutide on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single-dose of liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. figure-2"

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to 12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single-dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single-dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single-dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide in the pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5-6) to severe (Child Pugh score >9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide (8 to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single-dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single-dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The co-administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide. Atorvastatin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single-dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide. Acetaminophen Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single-dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single-dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single-dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Liraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

A dose-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in the 1.0 and the 3.0 mg/kg/day groups with incidences of 13% and 19% in males and 6% and 20% in females, respectively. C-cell adenomas did not occur in control groups or 0.03 and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. Treatment-related malignant C-cell carcinomas occurred in 3% of females in the 3.0 mg/kg/day group. Thyroid C-cell tumors are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in mice. A treatment-related increase in fibrosarcomas was seen on the dorsal skin and subcutis, the body surface used for drug injection, in males in the 3 mg/kg/day group. These fibrosarcomas were attributed to the high local concentration of drug near the injection site. The liraglutide concentration in the clinical formulation (6 mg/mL) is 10-times higher than the concentration in the formulation used to administer 3 mg/kg/day liraglutide to mice in the carcinogenicity study (0.6 mg/mL). A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0.075, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection with exposures 0.5-, 2- and 8-times the human exposure, respectively, resulting from the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. A treatment-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in males in 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide groups with incidences of 12%, 16%, 42%, and 46% and in all female liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 10%, 27%, 33%, and 56% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. A treatment-related increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in all male liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 2%, 8%, 6%, and 14% and in females at 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day with incidences of 0%, 0%, 4%, and 6% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. Thyroid C-cell carcinomas are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in rats. Studies in mice demonstrated that liraglutide-induced C-cell proliferation was dependent on the GLP-1 receptor and that liraglutide did not cause activation of the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene in thyroid C-cells. Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats is unknown and has not been determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Liraglutide was negative with and without metabolic activation in the Ames test for mutagenicity and in a human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test for clastogenicity. Liraglutide was negative in repeat-dose in vivo micronucleus tests in rats. In rat fertility studies using subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating until gestation day 17. No direct adverse effects on male fertility was observed at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day, a high dose yielding an estimated systemic exposure 11-times the human exposure at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC. In female rats, an increase in early embryonic deaths occurred at 1.0 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain and food consumption were observed in females at the 1.0 mg/kg/day dose."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In glycemic control trials in adults, liraglutide has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with one or two oral anti-diabetic medications or basal insulin. Liraglutide was also studied in a cardiovascular outcomes trial (LEADER trial). In each of the placebo controlled trials, treatment with liraglutide produced clinically and statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A 1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo. All liraglutide-treated patients started at 0.6 mg/day. The dose was increased in weekly intervals by 0.6 mg to reach 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg for patients randomized to these higher doses. Liraglutide 0.6 mg is not effective for glycemic control and is intended only as a starting dose to reduce gastrointestinal intolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Monotherapy In this 52-week trial, 746 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide 1.2 mg, liraglutide 1.8 mg, or glimepiride 8 mg. Patients who were randomized to glimepiride were initially treated with 2 mg daily for two weeks, increasing to 4 mg daily for another two weeks, and finally increasing to 8 mg daily. Treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg and 1.2 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c compared to glimepiride ( Table 3 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.6% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg treatment group, 6.0% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg treatment group, and 10.1% in the glimepiride-treatment group. The mean age of participants was 53 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 5 years. Participants were 49.7% male, 77.5% White, 12.6% Black or African American and 35.0% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.1 kg/m 2 . Table 3.

Randomization occurred after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week initial forced metformin titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin were increased up to 2000 mg/day. Treatment with liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to metformin resulted in a significant mean HbA 1c reduction relative to placebo add-on to metformin and resulted in a similar mean HbA 1c reduction relative to glimepiride 4 mg add-on to metformin ( Table 4 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 5.4% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin treatment group, 3.3% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg + metformin treatment group, 23.8% in the placebo + metformin treatment group, and 3.7% in the glimepiride + metformin treated group.

Patients were to continue their current treatment on metformin at a stable, pre-trial dose level and dosing frequency. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 6 years. Participants were 52.9% male, 86.6% White, 7.2% Black or African American and 16.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.8 kg/m 2 . The primary endpoint was the change in HbA 1c from baseline to Week 26. Treatment with liraglutide 1.2 mg and liraglutide 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c relative to sitagliptin 100 mg ( Table 5 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.1% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg group, 0.5% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg treatment group, and 4.1% in the sitagliptin 100 mg treatment group. From a mean baseline body weight of 94 kg, there was a mean reduction of 2.7 kg for liraglutide 1.2 mg, 3.3 kg for liraglutide 1.8 mg, and 0.8 kg for sitagliptin 100 mg. Table 5.

Mean HbA 1c for Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who Completed the 26-week Trial and for the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF, intent-to-treat) Data at Week 26 Combination Therapy with Metformin and Insulin This 26-week open-label trial enrolled 988 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control (HbA 1c 7 to 10%) on metformin (\u22651,500 mg/day) alone or inadequate glycemic control (HbA 1c 7 to 8.5%) on metformin (\u22651500 mg/day) and a sulfonylurea. Patients who were on metformin and a sulfonylurea discontinued the sulfonylurea then all patients entered a 12-week run-in period during which they received add-on therapy with liraglutide titrated to 1.8 mg once-daily. At the end of the run-in period, 498 patients (50%) achieved HbA 1c <7% with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin and continued treatment in a non-randomized, observational arm. Another 167 patients (17%) withdrew from the trial during the run-in period with approximately one-half of these patients doing so because of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The remaining 323 patients with HbA 1c \u22657% (33% of those who entered the run-in period) were randomized to 26 weeks of once-daily insulin detemir administered in the evening as add-on therapy (N=162) or to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin (N=161). The starting dose of insulin detemir was 10 units/day and the mean dose at the end of the 26-week randomized period was 39 units/day. During the 26-week randomized treatment period, the percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 11.2% in the group randomized to continued treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin and 1.2% in the group randomized to add-on therapy with insulin detemir. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 55.7% male, 91.3% White, 5.6% Black or African American and 12.5% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 34.0 kg/m 2 . Treatment with insulin detemir as add-on to liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG compared to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin alone ( Table 6 ). From a mean baseline body weight of 96 kg after randomization, there was a mean reduction of 0.3 kg in the patients who received insulin detemir add-on therapy compared to a mean reduction of 1.1 kg in the patients who continued on unchanged treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin alone.

Randomization occurred after a 4-week run-in period consisting of an initial, 2-week, forced-glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 2 weeks. During the titration period, doses of glimepiride were increased to 4 mg/day. The doses of glimepiride could be reduced (at the discretion of the investigator) from 4 mg/day to 3 mg/day or 2 mg/day (minimum) after randomization, in the event of unacceptable hypoglycemia or other adverse events. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 49.4% male, 64.4% White and 2.8% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 29.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride ( Table 7 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.0% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 3.5% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 17.5% in the placebo + glimepiride treatment group, and 6.9% in the rosiglitazone + glimepiride treatment group.

Randomization took place after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week forced metformin and glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin and glimepiride were to be increased up to 2,000 mg/day and 4 mg/day, respectively. After randomization, patients randomized to liraglutide 1.8 mg underwent a 2-week period of titration with liraglutide. During the trial, the liraglutide and metformin doses were fixed, although glimepiride and insulin glargine doses could be adjusted. Patients titrated glargine twice-weekly during the first 8 weeks of treatment based on self-measured fasting plasma glucose on the day of titration. After Week 8, the frequency of insulin glargine titration was left to the discretion of the investigator, but, at a minimum, the glargine dose was to be revised, if necessary, at Weeks 12 and 18. Only 20% of glargine-treated patients achieved the pre-specified target fasting plasma glucose of \u2264100 mg/dL. Therefore, optimal titration of the insulin glargine dose was not achieved in most patients. The mean age of participants was 58 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 56.5% male, 75.0% White and 3.6% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 30.5 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide as add-on to glimepiride and metformin resulted in a statistically significant mean reduction in HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride and metformin ( Table 8 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 0.9% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, 0.4% in the insulin glargine + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, and 11.3% in the placebo + metformin + glimepiride treatment group.

Maximally tolerated doses of background therapy were to remain unchanged for the duration of the trial. Patients randomized to exenatide started on a dose of 5 mcg twice-daily for 4 weeks and then were escalated to 10 mcg twice daily. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 51.9% male, 91.8% White, 5.4% Black or African American and 12.3% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG relative to exenatide ( Table 9 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued for ineffective therapy was 0.4% in the liraglutide treatment group and 0% in the exenatide treatment group. Both treatment groups had a mean decrease from baseline in body weight of approximately 3 kg. Table 9.

Patients underwent a 9-week run-in period (3-week forced dose escalation followed by a 6-week dose maintenance phase) with rosiglitazone (starting at 4 mg and increasing to 8 mg/day within 2 weeks) and metformin (starting at 500 mg with increasing weekly increments of 500 mg to a final dose of 2,000 mg/day). Only patients who tolerated the final dose of rosiglitazone (8 mg/day) and metformin (2000 mg/day) and completed the 6-week dose maintenance phase were eligible for randomization into the trial. The mean age of participants was 55 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 61.6% male, 84.2% White, 10.2% Black or African American and 16.4% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide as add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone produced a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone ( Table 10 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 1.7% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, 1.7% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, and 16.4% in the placebo + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group.

Liraglutide was added to the patient\u2019s stable pre-trial antidiabetic regimen (insulin therapy and/or metformin, pioglitazone, or sulfonylurea). The dose of liraglutide was escalated according to approved labeling to achieve a dose of 1.8 mg per day. The insulin dose was reduced by 20% at randomization for patients with baseline HbA 1c \u22648% and fixed until liraglutide dose escalation was complete. Dose reduction of insulin and SU was allowed in case of hypoglycemia; up titration of insulin was allowed but not beyond the pre-trial dose. The mean age of participants was 67 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Participants were 50.5% male, 92.3% White, 6.6% Black or African American, and 7.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 . Approximately half of patients had an eGFR between 30 and <45mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c from baseline at Week 26 compared to placebo (see Table 11 ). 123 patients reached the 1.8 mg dose of liraglutide.

Patients were randomized to liraglutide once-daily or placebo once-daily in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin treatment. All patients were on a metformin dose of 1000 to 2000 mg prior to randomization. The basal insulin dose was decreased by 20% at randomization and liraglutide was titrated weekly by 0.6 mg for 2 to 3 weeks based on tolerability and an average fasting plasma glucose goal of \u2264110 mg/dL. The mean age was 14.6 years: 29.9% were ages 10 to 14 years, and 70.1% were greater than 14 years of age. 38.1% were male, 64.9% were White, 13.4% were Asian, 11.9% were Black or African American; 29.1% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 and the mean BMI SDS was 2.9. 18.7% of patients were using basal insulin at baseline. The mean duration of diabetes was 1.9 years and the mean HbA 1c was 7.8%. At week 26, treatment with liraglutide was superior in reducing HbA 1c from baseline versus placebo. The estimated treatment difference in HbA 1c reduction from baseline between liraglutide and placebo was -1.06% with a 95% confidence interval of [-1.65%; -0.46%] (see Table 12 ). Table 12.

Missing observations (10.6% in the liraglutide, 14.5% in the placebo) were imputed from the placebo arm based on multiple (x10,000) imputations. The data for week 26 was then analyzed with an ANCOVA model containing treatment, sex and age group as fixed effects and baseline value as covariate. b Categories are derived from continuous measurements of HbA 1c using a pattern mixture model with multiple imputation for missing observations. * p-value <0.001 Liraglutide + Metformin \u00b1 Basal Insulin Placebo + Metformin \u00b1 Basal Insulin N 66 68 HbA 1c (%) Baseline 7.9 7.7 End of 26 weeks 7.1 8.2 Adjusted mean change from baseline after 26 weeks a -0.64 0.42 Treatment difference [95% CI] Liraglutide vs Placebo -1.06 [-1.65; -0.46] * Percentage of patients achieving HbA 1c <7% b 63.7 36.5 FPG (mg/dL) Baseline 157 147 End of 26 weeks 132 166 Adjusted mean change from baseline after 26 weeks a -19.4 14.4 Treatment difference [95% CI] Liraglutide vs Placebo -33.83 [-55.74; -11.92] 14.3 Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease The LEADER trial (NCT01179048) was a multi-national, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. In this study, 9,340 adult patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) were randomized to liraglutide 1.8 mg or placebo for a median duration of 3.5 years. The study compared the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events between liraglutide and placebo when these were added to, and used concomitantly with, background standard of care treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary endpoint, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), was the time to first occurrence of a three-part composite outcome which included; cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke. Patients eligible to enter the trial were; 50 years of age or older and had established, stable, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II and III heart failure (80% of the enrolled population) or were 60 years of age or older and had other specified risk factors for cardiovascular disease (20% of the enrolled population). At baseline, demographic and disease characteristics were balanced. The mean age was 64 years and the population was 64.3% male, 77.5% White, 10.0% Asian, and 8.3% Black or African American. In the study, 12.1% of the population identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 12.8 years, the mean HbA 1c was 8.7% and the mean BMI was 32.5 kg/m 2 . A history of previous myocardial infarction was reported in 31% of randomized individuals, a prior revascularization procedure in 39%, a prior ischemic stroke in 11%, documented symptomatic coronary disease in 9%, documented asymptomatic cardiac ischemia in 26%, and a diagnosis of NYHA class II to III heart failure in 14%. The mean eGFR at baseline was 79 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and 41.8% of patients had mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) , 20.7% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) and 2.4% of patients had severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). At baseline, patients treated their diabetes with; diet and exercise only (3.9%), oral antidiabetic drugs only (51.5%), oral antidiabetic drugs and insulin (36.7%) or insulin only (7.9%). The most common background antidiabetic drugs used at baseline and in the trial were metformin, sulfonylurea and insulin. Use of DPP-4 inhibitors and other GLP-1 receptor agonists was excluded by protocol and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors were either not approved or not widely available. At baseline, cardiovascular disease and risk factors were managed with; non-diuretic antihypertensives (92.4%), diuretics (41.8%), statin therapy (72.1%) and platelet aggregation inhibitors (66.8%). During the trial, investigators could modify anti-diabetic and cardiovascular medications to achieve local standard of care treatment targets with respect to blood glucose, lipid, and blood pressure, and manage patients recovering from an acute coronary syndrome or stroke event per local treatment guidelines. For the primary analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for non-inferiority against the pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE and to test for superiority on MACE if non-inferiority was demonstrated. Type 1 error was controlled across multiple tests. Liraglutide significantly reduced the occurrence of MACE. The estimated hazard ratio (95% CI) for time to first MACE was 0.87 (0.78, 0.97). Refer to Figure 5 and Table 13 . Vital status was available for 99.7% of subjects in the trial. A total of 828 deaths were recorded during the LEADER trial. A majority of the deaths in the trial were categorized as cardiovascular deaths and non-cardiovascular deaths were balanced between the treatment groups (3.5% in patients treated with liraglutide and 3.6% in patients treated with placebo). The estimated hazard ratio of time to all-cause death for liraglutide compared to placebo was 0.85 (0.74, 0.97). Figure 5.

      "16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING 16.1 How Supplied Liraglutide Injection: 18 mg/3 mL (6 mg/mL) clear, colorless solution in a prefilled, single-patient-use pen that delivers doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, or 1.8 mg is available in the following package sizes: 2 x Liraglutide injection pen NDC 0480-3667-20 3 x Liraglutide injection pen NDC 0480-3667-22 16.2 Recommended Storage Prior to first use, liraglutide injection should be stored in a refrigerator between 36\u00ba to 46\u00baF (2\u00ba to 8\u00baC). Do not store in the freezer or directly adjacent to the refrigerator cooling element. Do not freeze liraglutide injection and do not use liraglutide injection if it has been frozen. After first use of the liraglutide injection pen, the pen can be stored for 30 days at controlled room temperature (59\u00b0 to 86\u00b0F; 15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C) or in a refrigerator (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F; 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C). Keep the pen cap on when not in use. Protect liraglutide injection from excessive heat and sunlight. Always remove and safely discard the needle after each injection and store the liraglutide injection pen without an injection needle attached. This will reduce the potential for contamination, infection, and leakage while also ensuring dosing accuracy. Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use). Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Inform patients that liraglutide causes benign and malignant thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats and that the human relevance of this finding is unknown. Counsel patients to report symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a lump in the neck, hoarseness, dysphagia, or dyspnea) to their physician [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Pancreatitis Inform patients of the potential risk for pancreatitis. Explain that persistent severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to discontinue liraglutide promptly and contact their physician if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients Advise patients that they must never share a liraglutide injection pen with another person, even if the needle is changed, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Hypoglycemia Inform patients that hypoglycemia has been reported when liraglutide is used with insulin secretagogues or insulin and may occur in pediatric patients regardless of concomitant antidiabetic treatment. Educate patients or caregivers on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Acute Kidney Injury Advise patients of the potential risk of dehydration due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and to take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. Inform patients of the potential risk for worsening renal function, which in some cases may require dialysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] .

Do not throw away (See Figure J). \u2022 Pull off inner needle cap and throw away (See Figure K). A small drop of liquid may appear. This is normal. Step G. Dial the Dose \u2022 Liraglutide injection pen can give a dose of 0.6 mg (starting dose), 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg. Be sure that you know the dose of liraglutide that is prescribed for you. \u2022 Turn the dose selector until your needed dose lines up with the pointer (0.6 mg, 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg) (See Figure L). \u2022 You will hear a \u201cclick\u201d every time you turn the dose selector. Do not set the dose by counting the number of clicks you hear. \u2022 If you select a wrong dose, change it by turning the dose selector backwards or forwards until the correct dose lines up with the pointer. Be careful not to press the dose button when turning the dose selector. This may cause liraglutide to come out. Step H. Injecting the Dose \u2022 Insert needle into your skin in the stomach (abdomen), thigh or upper arm. Use the injection technique shown to you by your healthcare provider. Do not inject liraglutide into a vein or muscle. \u2022 Press down on the center of the dose button to inject until 0 mg lines up with the pointer (See Figure M). \u2022 Be careful not to touch the dose display with your other fingers. This may block the injection. \u2022 Keep the dose button pressed down and make sure that you keep the needle under the skin for a full count of 6 seconds to make sure the full dose is injected. Keep your thumb on the injection button until you remove the needle from your skin (See Figure N). \u2022 Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Step I. Withdraw Needle \u2022 You may see a drop of liraglutide at the needle tip. This is normal and it does not affect the dose you just received. If blood appears after you take the needle out of your skin, apply light pressure, but do not rub the area (See Figure O). Step J. Remove and Dispose of the Needle \u2022 Carefully put the outer needle cap over the needle (See Figure P). Unscrew the needle. \u2022 Safely remove the needle from your liraglutide injection pen after each use. \u2022 Put your used liraglutide injection pen and needles in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and pens in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: o made of a heavy-duty plastic o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out o upright and stable during use o leak-resistant o properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. Do not reuse or share your needles with other people. For more information about the safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. \u2022 Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. Caring for your liraglutide injection pen \u2022 After removing the needle, put the pen cap on your liraglutide injection pen and store your liraglutide injection pen without the needle attached (See Figure Q). \u2022 Do not try to refill your liraglutide injection pen \u2013 it is prefilled and is disposable. \u2022 Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart. \u2022 Keep your liraglutide injection pen away from dust, dirt and liquids. \u2022 If cleaning is needed, wipe the outside of the pen with a clean, damp cloth. How should I store liraglutide injection? Before use: \u2022 Store your new, unused liraglutide injection pen in the refrigerator at 36\u00ba to 46\u00baF (2\u00ba to 8\u00baC). \u2022 If liraglutide injection is stored outside of refrigeration (by mistake) prior to first use, it should be used or thrown away within 30 days. \u2022 Do not freeze liraglutide injection or use liraglutide injection if it has been frozen. Do not store liraglutide injection near the refrigerator cooling element. Pen in use: \u2022 Use a liraglutide injection pen for only 30 days. Throw away a used liraglutide injection pen 30 days after you start using it, even if some medicine is left in the pen. \u2022 Store your liraglutide injection pen at 59\u00ba to 86\u00baF (15\u00ba to 30\u00baC), or in a refrigerator at 36\u00ba to 46\u00baF (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C). \u2022 When carrying the pen away from home, store the pen at a temperature between 59\u00ba to 86\u00baF (15\u00ba to 30\u00baC). \u2022 If liraglutide injection has been exposed to temperatures above 86\u00baF (30\u00baC), it should be thrown away. \u2022 Protect your liraglutide injection pen from heat and sunlight. \u2022 Keep the pen cap on when your liraglutide injection pen is not in use. \u2022 Always remove the needle after each injection and store your pen without the needle attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage and inaccurate dosing. injection-pen needle-example triangle_1 triangle_2 triangle_3 tirangle_4 triangle_5 triangle_6 tirangle_7 triangle_8 image-a image-b image-c image-d image-e image-f image-g image-h image-i image-j image-k image-l image-m image-n image-o image-p image-q pen_image"

Liraglutide injection contains liraglutide and should not be coadministered with other liraglutide-containing products."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2.1 Recommended Dosage Adult Patients \u2022 The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide injection is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for one week. The 0.6 mg once daily dosage is intended to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] during initial titration and is not effective for glycemic control in adults. \u2022 After one week at the 0.6 mg once daily dosage, increase the dosage to 1.2 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. \u2022 If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage to the maximum recommended dosage of 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily after at least one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg once daily dosage. Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older \u2022 The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide injection is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. \u2022 If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage in 0.6 mg increments after at least one week on the current dosage. \u2022 The maximum recommended dosage is 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. 2.2 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose \u2022 Instruct patients who miss a dose of liraglutide injection to resume the once -daily dosage regimen as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Do not administer an extra dose or increase the dose to make up for the missed dose. \u2022 If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last liraglutide injection dose, reinitiate liraglutide injection at 0.6 mg once daily to mitigate any gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment. Upon reinitiation, liraglutide injection should be titrated at the discretion of the healthcare provider. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions \u2022 Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles. \u2022 Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously once daily at any time of day, independently of meals. \u2022 Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. No dosage adjustment is needed if changing the injection site and/or timing. \u2022 Rotate injection sites within the same region in order to reduce the risk of cutaneous amyloidosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. \u2022 When using liraglutide injection with insulin, administer as separate injections. Never mix. It is acceptable to inject liraglutide injection and insulin in the same body region but the injections should not be adjacent to each other."

      "5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Malignant thyroid Ccell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether liraglutide injection will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and liraglutide injection use in humans. Liraglutide injection is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of liraglutide injection and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated. 5.2 Pancreatitis Based on spontaneous postmarketing reports, acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with liraglutide injection. After initiation of liraglutide injection, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, liraglutide injection should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, liraglutide injection should not be restarted. In glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there have been 13 cases of pancreatitis among liraglutide injectiontreated patients and 1 case in a comparator (glimepiride) treated patient (2.7 vs. 0.5 cases per 1,000 patient-years). Nine of the 13 cases with liraglutide injection were reported as acute pancreatitis and four were reported as chronic pancreatitis. In one case in a liraglutide injection-treated patient, pancreatitis, with necrosis, was observed and led to death; however clinical causality could not be established. Some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse. Liraglutide injection has been studied in a limited number of patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown if patients with a history of pancreatitis are at higher risk for development of pancreatitis on liraglutide injection. 5.3 Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients Liraglutide injection pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Adult patients receiving liraglutide injection in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection regardless of insulin and/or metformin use. [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7.2)]. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications and pediatric patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.5 Acute Kidney Injury Liraglutide injection has not been found to be directly nephrotoxic in animal studies or clinical trials. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis in liraglutide injection-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Some of the reported events occurred in patients receiving one or more medications known to affect renal function or hydration status. Altered renal function has been reversed in many of the reported cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including liraglutide injection. Use caution when initiating or escalating doses of liraglutide injection in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with liraglutide injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue liraglutide injection; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with liraglutide injection. Liraglutide injection is contraindicated in patients who have had a serious hypersensitivity reaction to liraglutide or any of the excipients in liraglutide injection [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Acute Gallbladder Disease Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]."

Common Adverse Reactions The safety of liraglutide injection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in 5 glycemic control, placebocontrolled trials in adults and one trial of 52 weeks duration in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The data in Table 1 reflect exposure of 1,673 adult patients to liraglutide injection and a mean duration of exposure to liraglutide injection of 37.3 weeks. The mean age of adult patients was 58 years, 4% were 75 years or older and 54% were male. The population was 79% White, 6% Black or African American, 13% Asian; 4% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years and a mean HbA1c of 8.4%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% and moderately impaired in 12% of the pooled population. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions in adults, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of liraglutide injection for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on liraglutide injection than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with liraglutide injection. Overall, the type, and severity of adverse reactions in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older and above were comparable to that observed in the adult population. Table 1 Adverse reactions reported in \u2265 5% of Adult Patients Treated with Liraglutide Injection for Type 2 In an analysis of placebo- and active-controlled trials, the types and frequency of common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, were similar to those listed in Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions In the pool of 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled adult clinical trials, withdrawals due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions, occurred in 4.3% of liraglutide injection-treated patients and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Withdrawal due to gastrointestinal adverse events mainly occurred during the first 2 to 3 months of the trials. Injection site reactions Injection site reactions (e.g., injection site rash, erythema) were reported in approximately 2% of liraglutide injection-treated adult patients in the five double-blind, glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration. Less than 0.2% of liraglutide injection-treated patients discontinued due to injection site reactions. Hypoglycemia In 5 adult glycemic control, placebo-controlled clinical trials of at least 26 weeks duration, hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person for treatment occurred in 8 liraglutide injection-treated patients (7.5 events per 1,000 patient-years). Of these 8 liraglutide injection-treated patients, 7 patients were concomitantly using a sulfonylurea. Table 2 Adult Incidence (%) and Rate (episodes/patient year) of Hypoglycemia in 26-Week Combination Therapy Placebo-controlled Trials In a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with a 26-week open-label extension, 21.2% of liraglutide injection-treated patients (mean age 14.6 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus, had hypoglycemia with a blood glucose <54 mg/dL with or without symptoms (335 events per 1,000 patient years). No severe hypoglycemic episodes occurred in the liraglutide injection treatment group (severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions). Papillary thyroid carcinoma In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there were 7 reported cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma in patients treated with liraglutide injection and 1 case in a comparator-treated patient (1.5 vs. 0.5 cases per 1,000 patient-years). Most of these papillary thyroid carcinomas were <1 cm in greatest diameter and were diagnosed in surgical pathology specimens after thyroidectomy prompted by findings on protocol-specified screening with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, the incidence of cholelithiasis was 0.3% in both liraglutide injection-treated and placebo-treated patients. The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.2% in both liraglutide injection-treated and placebo-treated patients. Laboratory Tests Bilirubin In the five adult glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration, mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (elevations to no more than twice the upper limit of the reference range) occurred in 4.0% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 2.1% of placebo-treated patients and 3.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. This finding was not accompanied by abnormalities in other liver tests. The significance of this isolated finding is unknown. Calcitonin Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program. At the end of the adult glycemic control trials, adjusted mean serum calcitonin concentrations were higher in liraglutide injection-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients but not compared to patients receiving active comparator. Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less. Among adult patients with pretreatment calcitonin <20 ng/L, calcitonin elevations to >20 ng/L occurred in 0.7% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, and 0.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Lipase and Amylase In one adult glycemic control trial in renal impairment patients, a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed for liraglutide injection-treated patients while placebo-treated patients had a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with liraglutide injection is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Vital signs Liraglutide injection did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed in adult patients treated with liraglutide injection compared to placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of liraglutide injection. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal: Acute pancreatitis, hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis sometimes resulting in death, ileus General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Allergic reactions: rash and pruritus Hepatobiliary: Elevations of liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy, hepatitis Immune system: Angioedema and anaphylactic reactions Metabolism and nutrition: Dehydration resulting from nausea, vomiting and diarrhea Neoplasms: Medullary thyroid carcinoma Nervous system: Dysgeusia, dizziness Renal and urinary: Increased serum creatinine, acute renal failure or worsening of chronic renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis Skin and subcutaneous tissue: Cutaneous amyloidosis Table 1 Adverse reactions reported in \u2265 5% of Adult Patients Treated with Liraglutide Injection for Type 2 Table 2 Adult Incidence (%) and Rate (episodes/patient year) of Hypoglycemia in 26-Week Combination Therapy Placebo-controlled Trials"

      "7.1 Effects of Delayed Gastric Emptying on Oral Medications Liraglutide injection causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials, liraglutide injection did not affect the absorption of the tested orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with liraglutide injection. 7.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin Liraglutide injection stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. Patients receiving liraglutide injection in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. When initiating liraglutide injection, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to liraglutide injection during pregnancy. Liraglutide injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal reproduction studies identified increased adverse developmental outcomes from exposure during pregnancy. Liraglutide exposure was associated with early embryonic deaths and an imbalance in some fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats administered liraglutide during organogenesis at doses that approximate clinical exposures at the maximum Confidential recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.8 mg/day. In pregnant rabbits administered liraglutide during organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of major fetal abnormalities were seen at exposures below the human exposures at the MRHD [see Animal Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects for women with uncontrolled pre-gestational diabetes (Hemoglobin A 1C >7) is 6 to 10%. The major birth defect rate has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a Hemoglobin A 1C >10. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Animal Data Female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide beginning 2 weeks before mating through gestation day 17 had estimated systemic exposures 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times the human exposure at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. The number of early embryonic deaths in the 1 mg/kg/day group increased slightly. Fetal abnormalities and variations in kidneys and blood vessels, irregular ossification of the skull, and a more complete state of ossification occurred at all doses. Mottled liver and minimally kinked ribs occurred at the highest dose. The incidence of fetal malformations in liraglutide-treated groups exceeding concurrent and historical controls were misshapen oropharynx and/or narrowed opening into larynx at 0.1 mg/kg/day and umbilical hernia at 0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg/day. Pregnant rabbits given subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through day 18 inclusive, had estimated systemic exposures less than the human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day at all doses, based on plasma AUC. Liraglutide decreased fetal weight and dose-dependently increased the incidence of total major fetal abnormalities at all doses. The incidence of malformations exceeded concurrent and historical controls at 0.01 mg/kg/day (kidneys, scapula), \u2265 0.01 mg/kg/day (eyes, forelimb), 0.025 mg/kg/day (brain, tail and sacral vertebrae, major blood vessels and heart, umbilicus), \u2265 0.025 mg/kg/day (sternum) and at 0.05 mg/kg/day (parietal bones, major blood vessels). Irregular ossification and/or skeletal abnormalities occurred in the skull and jaw, vertebrae and ribs, sternum, pelvis, tail, and scapula; and dose-dependent minor skeletal variations were observed. Visceral abnormalities occurred in blood vessels, lung, liver, and esophagus. Bilobed or bifurcated gallbladder was seen in all treatment groups, but not in the control group. In pregnant female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through weaning or termination of nursing on lactation day 24, estimated systemic exposures were 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day, based on plasma AUC. A slight delay in parturition was observed in the majority of treated rats. Group mean body weight of neonatal rats from liraglutide-treated dams was lower than neonatal rats from control group dams. Bloody scabs and agitated behavior occurred in male rats descended from dams treated with 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide. Group mean body weight from birth to postpartum day 14 trended lower in F2 generation rats descended from liraglutide-treated rats compared to F2 generation rats descended from controls, but differences did not reach statistical significance for any group. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of liraglutide injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Liraglutide was present in milk of lactating rats [see Data]. Developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for liraglutide injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liraglutide injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In lactating rats, liraglutide was present unchanged in milk at concentrations approximately 50% of maternal plasma concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide injection as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older. Use of liraglutide injection for this indication is supported by a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial and a 26-week open-label extension in 134 pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a pediatric pharmacokinetic study, and studies in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1,14.2)]. The risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection in pediatric patients regardless of insulin and/or metformin use [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide injection have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the liraglutide injection treatment arms of the glycemic control trials, a total of 832 (19.3%) of the patients were 65 to 74 years of age and 145 (3.4%) were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness for liraglutide injection have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of liraglutide injection is recommended for patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The safety and efficacy of liraglutide injection was evaluated in a 26-week clinical study that included patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. There is limited experience with liraglutide injection in patients with end stage renal disease. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Use caution in patients who experience dehydration. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There is limited experience in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, liraglutide injection should be used with caution in this patient population. No dose adjustment of liraglutide injection is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.8 Gastroparesis Liraglutide injection slows gastric emptying. Liraglutide injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing gastroparesis."

      "Liraglutide Injection contains liraglutide, an analog of human GLP-1 and acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Liraglutide Injection contains chemically synthesized Liraglutide that has been engineered to be 97% homologous to native human GLP-1 by substituting arginine for lysine at position 34. Liraglutide is made by attaching a C-16 fatty acid (palmitic acid) with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26 of the peptide precursor.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Liraglutide is an acylated human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37). GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-IV and NEP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide injection\u2019s pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide injection lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide injection or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide injection 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) liraglutide injection on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner (Figure 2). Figure 2 Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide Injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide injection lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single dose of liraglutide injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide injection causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide injection on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide injection at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to 12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide injection, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide injection is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide injection using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide injection in the pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide injection compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide injection provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5 to 6) to severe (Child Pugh score > 9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide injection has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that Cmax of liraglutide injection (8 to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; Cmax decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (Tmax) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The co-administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; Cmax decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median Tmax was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide injection. Atorvastatin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38% and median Tmax was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide injection. Acetaminophen Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1,000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Acetaminophen Cmax was decreased by 31% and median Tmax was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide injection at steady state. Griseofulvin Cmax increased by 37% while median Tmax did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Liraglutide injection lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide injection on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide injection increased the levonorgestrel AUC0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide injection delayed Tmax for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide injection and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those with liraglutide injection or other liraglutide products. A subset of liraglutide injection-treated patients (1,104 of 2,501, 44%) in five adult double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] and 102/1,104 (9%) of liraglutide injection-treated patients developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Of these 102 liraglutide injection-treated patients, 56 (5%) patients developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 12 (1%) of the liraglutide injection-treated patients. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-liraglutide antibodies on effectiveness of liraglutide injection. In five double-blind adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of liraglutide injection-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for liraglutide injection-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. In a clinical trial with pediatric patients aged 10 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 1 (2%) liraglutide injection-treated patient at week 26 and 5 (9%) liraglutide injection-treated patients at week 53. None of the 5 patients had antibodies cross reactive to native GLP-1 or had neutralizing antibodies. Figure 2"

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female CD-1 mice at doses of 0.03, 0.2, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection yielding systemic exposures 0.2-, 2-, 10- and 45-times the human exposure, respectively, at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day based on plasma AUC comparison. A dose-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in the 1.0 and the 3.0 mg/kg/day groups with incidences of 13% and 19% in males and 6% and 20% in females, respectively. C-cell adenomas did not occur in control groups or 0.03 and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. Treatment-related malignant C-cell carcinomas occurred in 3% of females in the 3.0 mg/kg/day group. Thyroid C-cell tumors are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in mice. A treatment-related increase in fibrosarcomas was seen on the dorsal skin and subcutis, the body surface used for drug injection, in males in the 3 mg/kg/day group. These fibrosarcomas were attributed to the high local concentration of drug near the injection site. The liraglutide concentration in the clinical formulation (6 mg/mL) is 10-times higher than the concentration in the formulation used to administer 3 mg/kg/day liraglutide to mice in the carcinogenicity study (0.6 mg/mL). A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0.075, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection with exposures 0.5-, 2- and 8-times the human exposure, respectively, resulting from the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. A treatment-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in males in 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide groups with incidences of 12%, 16%, 42%, and 46% and in all female liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 10%, 27%, 33%, and 56% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. A treatment-related increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in all male liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 2%, 8%, 6%, and 14% and in females at 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day with incidences of 0%, 0%, 4%, and 6% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. Thyroid C-cell carcinomas are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in rats. Studies in mice demonstrated that liraglutide-induced C-cell proliferation was dependent on the GLP-1 receptor and that liraglutide did not cause activation of the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene in thyroid C-cells. Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats is unknown and has not been determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Liraglutide was negative with and without metabolic activation in the Ames test for mutagenicity and in a human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test for clastogenicity. Liraglutide was negative in repeat-dose in vivo micronucleus tests in rats. In rat fertility studies using subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating until gestation day 17. No direct adverse effects on male fertility was observed at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day, a high dose yielding an estimated systemic exposure 11- times the human exposure at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC. In female rats, an increase in early embryonic deaths occurred at 1.0 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain and food consumption were observed in females at the 1.0 mg/kg/day dose."

      "14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In glycemic control trials in adults, liraglutide injection has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with one or two oral anti-diabetic medications or basal insulin. In each of the placebo controlled trials, treatment with liraglutide injection produced clinically and statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo. All liraglutide injection-treated patients started at 0.6 mg/day. The dose was increased in weekly intervals by 0.6 mg to reach 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg for patients randomized to these higher doses. Liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is not effective for glycemic control and is intended only as a starting dose to reduce gastrointestinal intolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Monotherapy In this 52-week trial, 746 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, or glimepiride 8 mg. Patients who were randomized to glimepiride were initially treated with 2 mg daily for two weeks, increasing to 4 mg daily for another two weeks, and finally increasing to 8 mg daily. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and 1.2 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c compared to glimepiride (Table 3). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.6% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg treatment group, 6.0% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg treatment group, and 10.1% in the glimepiride-treatment group. The mean age of participants was 53 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 5 years. Participants were 49.7% male, 77.5% White, 12.6% Black or African American and 35.0% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.1 kg/m 2 . Table 3 Results of a 52-week Monotherapy Trial in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Figure 3 Mean HbA 1c for Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who Completed the 52-week Trial and for the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF, intent-to-treat) data at Week 52 (Monotherapy) Combination Therapy Add-on to Metformin In this 26-week trial, 1,091 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 0.6 mg, liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, placebo, or glimepiride 4 mg (one-half of the maximal approved dose in the United States), all as add-on to metformin. Randomization occurred after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week initial forced metformin titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin were increased up to 2,000 mg/day. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to metformin resulted in a significant mean HbA1c reduction relative to placebo add-on to metformin and resulted in a similar mean HbA1c reduction relative to glimepiride 4 mg add-on to metformin (Table 4). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 5.4% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin treatment group, 3.3% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + metformin treatment group, 23.8% in the placebo + metformin treatment group, and 3.7% in the glimepiride + metformin treated group. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 7 years. Participants were 58.2% male, 87.1% White and 2.4% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 31.0 kg/m2. Table 4 Results of a 26-week Trial of Liraglutide Injection as Add-on to Metformin in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Liraglutide Injection Compared to Sitagliptin, Both as Add-on to Metformin In this 26-week, open-label trial, 665 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on a background of metformin \u22651,500 mg per day were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.2 mg once daily, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg once daily or sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, all dosed according to approved labeling. Patients were to continue their current treatment on metformin at a stable, pre-trial dose level and dosing frequency. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 6 years. Participants were 52.9% male, 86.6% White, 7.2% Black or African American and 16.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.8 kg/m 2 . The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c relative to sitagliptin 100 mg (Table 5). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.1% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg group, 0.5% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg treatment group, and 4.1% in the sitagliptin 100 mg treatment group. From a mean baseline body weight of 94 kg, there was a mean reduction of 2.7 kg for liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, 3.3 kg for liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, and 0.8 kg for sitagliptin 100 mg. Table 5 Results of a 26-week Open-label Trial of Liraglutide Injection Compared to Sitagliptin (both in combination with metformin) in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Figure 4 Mean HbA 1c for Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who Completed the 26-week Trial and for the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF, intent-to-treat) data at Week 26 Combination Therapy with Metformin and Insulin This 26-week open-label trial enrolled 988 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control (HbA 1c 7-10%) on metformin (\u22651,500 mg/day) alone or inadequate glycemic control (HbA 1c 7-8.5%) on metformin (\u22651,500 mg/day) and a sulfonylurea. Patients who were on metformin and a sulfonylurea discontinued the sulfonylurea then all patients entered a 12-week run-in period during which they received add-on therapy with liraglutide injection titrated to 1.8 mg once-daily. At the end of the run-in period, 498 patients (50%) achieved HbA1c <7% with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin and continued treatment in a non-randomized, observational arm. Another 167 patients (17%) withdrew from the trial during the run-in period with approximately one-half of these patients doing so because of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The remaining 323 patients with HbA 1c \u22657% (33% of those who entered the run-in period) were randomized to 26 weeks of once-daily insulin detemir administered in the evening as add-on therapy (N=162) or to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin (N=161). The starting dose of insulin detemir was 10 units/day and the mean dose at the end of the 26-week randomized period was 39 units/day. During the 26 week randomized treatment period, the percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 11.2% in the group randomized to continued treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin and 1.2% in the group randomized to add-on therapy with insulin detemir. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 55.7% male, 91.3% White, 5.6% Black or African American and 12.5% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 34.0 kg/m2. Treatment with insulin detemir as add-on to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c and FPG compared to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin alone (Table 6). From a mean baseline body weight of 96 kg after randomization, there was a mean reduction of 0.3 kg in the patients who received insulin detemir add-on therapy compared to a mean reduction of 1.1 kg in the patients who continued on unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin alone. Table 6 Results of a 26-week Open-label Trial of Insulin detemir as add on to Liraglutide Injection + Metformin Compared to Continued Treatment with Liraglutide Injection + Metformin alone in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus not Achieving HbA 1c < 7% after 12 weeks of Metformin and Liraglutide Injection a Add-on to Sulfonylurea In this 26-week trial, 1,041 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 0.6 mg, liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, placebo, or rosiglitazone 4 mg (one-half of the maximal approved dose in the United States), all as add-on to glimepiride. Randomization occurred after a 4-week run-in period consisting of an initial, 2-week, forced-glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 2 weeks. During the titration period, doses of glimepiride were increased to 4 mg/day. The doses of glimepiride could be reduced (at the discretion of the investigator) from 4 mg/day to 3 mg/day or 2 mg/day (minimum) after randomization, in the event of unacceptable hypoglycemia or other adverse events. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 49.4% male, 64.4% White and 2.8% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 29.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride (Table 7). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.0% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 3.5% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 17.5% in the placebo + glimepiride treatment group, and 6.9% in the rosiglitazone + glimepiride treatment group. Table 7 Results of a 26-week Trial of Liraglutide Injection as add-on to Sulfonylurea in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Add-on to Metformin and Sulfonylurea In this 26-week trial, 581 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, placebo, or insulin glargine, all as add-on to metformin and glimepiride. Randomization took place after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week forced metformin and glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin and glimepiride were to be increased up to 2,000 mg/day and 4 mg/day, respectively. After randomization, patients randomized to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg underwent a 2 week period of titration with liraglutide injection. During the trial, the liraglutide injection and metformin doses were fixed, although glimepiride and insulin glargine doses could be adjusted. Patients titrated glargine twice-weekly during the first 8 weeks of treatment based on self-measured fasting plasma glucose on the day of titration. After Week 8, the frequency of insulin glargine titration was left to the discretion of the investigator, but, at a minimum, the glargine dose was to be revised, if necessary, at Weeks 12 and 18. Only 20% of glargine-treated patients achieved the pre-specified target fasting plasma glucose of \u2264100 mg/dL. Therefore, optimal titration of the insulin glargine dose was not achieved in most patients. The mean age of participants was 58 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 56.5% male, 75.0% White and 3.6% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 30.5 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection as add-on to glimepiride and metformin resulted in a statistically significant mean reduction in HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride and metformin (Table 8). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 0.9% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, 0.4% in the insulin glargine + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, and 11.3% in the placebo + metformin + glimepiride treatment group.

Maximally tolerated doses of background therapy were to remain unchanged for the duration of the trial. Patients randomized to exenatide started on a dose of 5 mcg twice-daily for 4 weeks and then were escalated to 10 mcg twice daily. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 51.9% male, 91.8% White, 5.4% Black or African American and 12.3% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG relative to exenatide (Table 9). The percentage of patients who discontinued for ineffective therapy was 0.4% in the liraglutide injection treatment group and 0% in the exenatide treatment group. Both treatment groups had a mean decrease from baseline in body weight of approximately 3 kg. Table 9 Results of a 26-week Open-label trial of Liraglutide Injection versus Exenatide (both in combination with metformin and/or sulfonylurea) in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Add-on to Metformin and Thiazolidinedione In this 26-week trial, 533 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg or placebo, all as add-on to rosiglitazone (8 mg) plus metformin (2,000 mg). Patients underwent a 9 week run-in period (3-week forced dose escalation followed by a 6-week dose maintenance phase) with rosiglitazone (starting at 4 mg and increasing to 8 mg/day within 2 weeks) and metformin (starting at 500 mg with increasing weekly increments of 500 mg to a final dose of 2,000 mg/day). Only patients who tolerated the final dose of rosiglitazone (8 mg/day) and metformin (2,000 mg/day) and completed the 6-week dose maintenance phase were eligible for randomization into the trial. The mean age of participants was 55 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 61.6% male, 84.2% White, 10.2% Black or African American and 16.4% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection as add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone produced a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA1c compared to placebo add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 10). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 1.7% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, 1.7% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, and 16.4% in the placebo + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group.

Liraglutide injection was added to the patient\u2019s stable pre-trial antidiabetic regimen (insulin therapy and/or metformin, pioglitazone, or sulfonylurea). The dose of liraglutide injection was escalated according to approved labeling to achieve a dose of 1.8 mg per day. The insulin dose was reduced by 20% at randomization for patients with baseline HbA 1c \u2264 8% and fixed until liraglutide dose escalation was complete. Dose reduction of insulin and SU was allowed in case of hypoglycemia; up titration of insulin was allowed but not beyond the pre-trial dose. The mean age of participants was 67 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Participants were 50.5% male, 92.3% White, 6.6% Black or African American, and 7.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m2. Approximately half of patients had an eGFR between 30 and <45mL/min/1.73 m2. Treatment with liraglutide injection resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c from baseline at Week 26 compared to placebo (see Table 11). 123 patients reached the 1.8 mg dose of liraglutide injection. Table 11 Results of a 26-week Trial of Liraglutide Injection Compared to Placebo in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Moderate Renal Impairment a 14.2 Glycemic Control Trial in Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Liraglutide injection was evaluated in a 26-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo controlled multicenter trial (NCT01541215), in 134 pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 10 years and older. Patients were randomized to liraglutide injection once-daily or placebo once-daily in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin treatment. All patients were on a metformin dose of 1,000 to 2,000 mg prior to randomization. The basal insulin dose was decreased by 20% at randomization and liraglutide injection was titrated weekly by 0.6 mg for 2 to 3 weeks based on tolerability and an average fasting plasma glucose goal of \u2264110 mg/dL. The mean age was 14.6 years: 29.9% were ages 10 to 14 years, and 70.1% were greater than 14 years of age. 38.1% were male, 64.9% were White, 13.4% were Asian, 11.9% were Black or African American; 29.1% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m2 and the mean BMI SDS was 2.9. 18.7% of patients were using basal insulin at baseline. The mean duration of diabetes was 1.9 years and the mean HbA 1c was 7.8%. At week 26, treatment with liraglutide injection was superior in reducing HbA1c from baseline versus placebo. The estimated treatment difference in HbA 1c reduction from baseline between liraglutide injection and placebo was -1.06% with a 95% confidence interval of [-1.65%; -0.46%] (see Table 12).

Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Inform patients that liraglutide causes benign and malignant thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats and that the human relevance of this finding is unknown. Counsel patients to report symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a lump in the neck, hoarseness, dysphagia, or dyspnea) to their physician [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Pancreatitis Inform patients of the potential risk for pancreatitis. Explain that persistent severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to discontinue Liraglutide injection promptly and contact their physician if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients Advise patients that they must never share a liraglutide injection pen with another person, even if the needle is changed, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hypoglycemia Inform patients that hypoglycemia has been reported when liraglutide injection is used with insulin secretagogues or insulin and may occur in pediatric patients regardless of concomitant antidiabetic treatment. Educate patients or caregivers on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Kidney Injury Advise patients of the potential risk of dehydration due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and to take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. Inform patients of the potential risk for worsening renal function, which in some cases may require dialysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients that serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of liraglutide injection. Advise patients on the symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and instruct them to stop taking liraglutide injection and seek medical advice promptly if such symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Acute Gallbladder Disease Inform patients of the potential risk for cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. Instruct patients to contact their physician if cholelithiasis or cholecystitis is suspected for appropriate clinical follow-up [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Missed Dose Inform patients not to take an extra dose of liraglutide injection to make up for a missed dose. If a dose is missed, the once-daily regimen should be resumed as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last dose, advise the patient to reinitiate liraglutide injection at 0.6 mg to mitigate any gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment. Liraglutide injection should be titrated at the discretion of the healthcare provider [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Manufactured by: Hybio Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

      "Liraglutide Injection First read the Medication Guide that comes with your liraglutide injection single-patient use pen and then read this Patient Instructions for Use for information about how to use your liraglutide injection pen the right way. These instructions do not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Do not share your liraglutide injection pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. Your liraglutide injection pen is a disposable single-patient-use prefilled pen injector that contains 3 mL of liraglutide injection and will deliver doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg. The number of doses that you can take with a liraglutide injection pen depends on the dose of medicine that is prescribed for you. Your healthcare provider will tell you how much liraglutide injection to take. Liraglutide injection pen should be used with compatible disposable needles. Talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist for more information about needles for your liraglutide injection pen. Important Information Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. Always remove the needle after each injection, and store your pen without the needle attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of liraglutide, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. Keep your liraglutide injection pen and all medicines out of the reach of children. If you drop your liraglutide injection pen, repeat \u201cFirst Time Use For Each New Pen\u201d (steps A through D). Be careful not to bend or damage the needle. Do not use the cartridge scale to measure how much liraglutide injection to inject. Be careful when handling used needles to avoid needle stick injuries. You can use your liraglutide injection pen for up to 30 days after you use it the first time. First Time Use for Each New Pen How should I store liraglutide injection? Before use: Store your new, unused liraglutide injection pen in the refrigerator at 36\u00baF to 46\u00baF (2\u00baC to 8\u00baC). If liraglutide injection is stored outside of refrigeration (by mistake) prior to first use, it should be used or thrown away within 30 days. Do not freeze liraglutide injection or use liraglutide injection if it has been frozen. Do not store liraglutide injection near the refrigerator cooling element. Pen in use: Use a liraglutide injection pen for only 30 days. Throw away a used liraglutide injection pen 30 days after you start using it, even if some medicine is left in the pen. Store your liraglutide injection pen at 59\u00baF to 86\u00baF (15\u00baC to 30\u00baC), or in a refrigerator at 36\u00baF to 46\u00baF (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). When carrying the pen away from home, store the pen at a temperature between 59\u00baF to 86\u00baF (15\u00baC to 30\u00baC). If liraglutide injection has been exposed to temperatures above 86\u00baF (30\u00b0C), it should be thrown away. Protect your liraglutide injection pen from heat and sunlight. Keep the pen cap on when your liraglutide injection pen is not in use. Always remove the needle after each injection and store your pen without the needle attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage and inaccurate dosing. Revised: March 2024 liraglutide stepa-b stepc stepd stepe-f stepg steph stepi-j stepend stepend2"

Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older \u2022 The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide injection is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. \u2022 If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage in 0.6 mg increments after at least one week on the current dosage. \u2022 The maximum recommended dosage is 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. 2.2 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose \u2022 Instruct patients who miss a dose of liraglutide injection to resume the once -daily dosage regimen as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Do not administer an extra dose or increase the dose to make up for the missed dose. \u2022 If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last liraglutide injection dose, reinitiate liraglutide injection at 0.6 mg once daily to mitigate any gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment. Upon reinitiation, liraglutide injection should be titrated at the discretion of the healthcare provider. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions \u2022 Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles. \u2022 Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously once daily at any time of day, independently of meals. \u2022 Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. No dosage adjustment is needed if changing the injection site and/or timing. \u2022 Rotate injection sites within the same region in order to reduce the risk of cutaneous amyloidosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. \u2022 When using liraglutide injection with insulin, administer as separate injections. Never mix. It is acceptable to inject liraglutide injection and insulin in the same body region but the injections should not be adjacent to each other."

      "5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Malignant thyroid Ccell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether liraglutide injection will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and liraglutide injection use in humans. Liraglutide injection is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of liraglutide injection and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated. 5.2 Pancreatitis Based on spontaneous postmarketing reports, acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with liraglutide injection. After initiation of liraglutide injection, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, liraglutide injection should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, liraglutide injection should not be restarted. In glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there have been 13 cases of pancreatitis among liraglutide injectiontreated patients and 1 case in a comparator (glimepiride) treated patient (2.7 vs. 0.5 cases per 1,000 patient-years). Nine of the 13 cases with liraglutide injection were reported as acute pancreatitis and four were reported as chronic pancreatitis. In one case in a liraglutide injection-treated patient, pancreatitis, with necrosis, was observed and led to death; however clinical causality could not be established. Some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse. Liraglutide injection has been studied in a limited number of patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown if patients with a history of pancreatitis are at higher risk for development of pancreatitis on liraglutide injection. 5.3 Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients Liraglutide injection pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Adult patients receiving liraglutide injection in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection regardless of insulin and/or metformin use. [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7.2)]. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications and pediatric patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.5 Acute Kidney Injury Liraglutide injection has not been found to be directly nephrotoxic in animal studies or clinical trials. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis in liraglutide injection-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Some of the reported events occurred in patients receiving one or more medications known to affect renal function or hydration status. Altered renal function has been reversed in many of the reported cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including liraglutide injection. Use caution when initiating or escalating doses of liraglutide injection in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with liraglutide injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue liraglutide injection; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with liraglutide injection. Liraglutide injection is contraindicated in patients who have had a serious hypersensitivity reaction to liraglutide or any of the excipients in liraglutide injection [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Acute Gallbladder Disease Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation Liraglutide injection delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations. Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking liraglutide injection, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing liraglutide injection could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking liraglutide injection."

Common Adverse Reactions The safety of liraglutide injection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in 5 glycemic control, placebocontrolled trials in adults and one trial of 52 weeks duration in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The data in Table 1 reflect exposure of 1,673 adult patients to liraglutide injection and a mean duration of exposure to liraglutide injection of 37.3 weeks. The mean age of adult patients was 58 years, 4% were 75 years or older and 54% were male. The population was 79% White, 6% Black or African American, 13% Asian; 4% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years and a mean HbA1c of 8.4%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% and moderately impaired in 12% of the pooled population. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions in adults, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of liraglutide injection for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on liraglutide injection than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with liraglutide injection. Overall, the type, and severity of adverse reactions in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older and above were comparable to that observed in the adult population. Table 1 Adverse reactions reported in \u2265 5% of Adult Patients Treated with Liraglutide Injection for Type 2 In an analysis of placebo- and active-controlled trials, the types and frequency of common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, were similar to those listed in Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions In the pool of 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled adult clinical trials, withdrawals due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions, occurred in 4.3% of liraglutide injection-treated patients and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Withdrawal due to gastrointestinal adverse events mainly occurred during the first 2 to 3 months of the trials. Injection site reactions Injection site reactions (e.g., injection site rash, erythema) were reported in approximately 2% of liraglutide injection-treated adult patients in the five double-blind, glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration. Less than 0.2% of liraglutide injection-treated patients discontinued due to injection site reactions. Hypoglycemia In 5 adult glycemic control, placebo-controlled clinical trials of at least 26 weeks duration, hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person for treatment occurred in 8 liraglutide injection-treated patients (7.5 events per 1,000 patient-years). Of these 8 liraglutide injection-treated patients, 7 patients were concomitantly using a sulfonylurea. Table 2 Adult Incidence (%) and Rate (episodes/patient year) of Hypoglycemia in 26-Week Combination Therapy Placebo-controlled Trials In a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with a 26-week open-label extension, 21.2% of liraglutide injection-treated patients (mean age 14.6 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus, had hypoglycemia with a blood glucose <54 mg/dL with or without symptoms (335 events per 1,000 patient years). No severe hypoglycemic episodes occurred in the liraglutide injection treatment group (severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions). Papillary thyroid carcinoma In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there were 7 reported cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma in patients treated with liraglutide injection and 1 case in a comparator-treated patient (1.5 vs. 0.5 cases per 1,000 patient-years). Most of these papillary thyroid carcinomas were <1 cm in greatest diameter and were diagnosed in surgical pathology specimens after thyroidectomy prompted by findings on protocol-specified screening with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, the incidence of cholelithiasis was 0.3% in both liraglutide injection-treated and placebo-treated patients. The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.2% in both liraglutide injection-treated and placebo-treated patients. Laboratory Tests Bilirubin In the five adult glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration, mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (elevations to no more than twice the upper limit of the reference range) occurred in 4.0% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 2.1% of placebo-treated patients and 3.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. This finding was not accompanied by abnormalities in other liver tests. The significance of this isolated finding is unknown. Calcitonin Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program. At the end of the adult glycemic control trials, adjusted mean serum calcitonin concentrations were higher in liraglutide injection-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients but not compared to patients receiving active comparator. Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less. Among adult patients with pretreatment calcitonin <20 ng/L, calcitonin elevations to >20 ng/L occurred in 0.7% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, and 0.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Lipase and Amylase In one adult glycemic control trial in renal impairment patients, a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed for liraglutide injection-treated patients while placebo-treated patients had a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with liraglutide injection is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Vital signs Liraglutide injection did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed in adult patients treated with liraglutide injection compared to placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of liraglutide injection. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal: Acute pancreatitis, hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis sometimes resulting in death, ileus General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Allergic reactions: rash and pruritus Hepatobiliary: Elevations of liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy, hepatitis Immune system: Angioedema and anaphylactic reactions Metabolism and nutrition: Dehydration resulting from nausea, vomiting and diarrhea Neoplasms: Medullary thyroid carcinoma Nervous system: Dysgeusia, dizziness Pulmonary: Pulmonary aspiration has occurred in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation.

      "7.1 Effects of Delayed Gastric Emptying on Oral Medications Liraglutide injection causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials, liraglutide injection did not affect the absorption of the tested orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with liraglutide injection. 7.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin Liraglutide injection stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. Patients receiving liraglutide injection in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. When initiating liraglutide injection, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to liraglutide injection during pregnancy. Liraglutide injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal reproduction studies identified increased adverse developmental outcomes from exposure during pregnancy. Liraglutide exposure was associated with early embryonic deaths and an imbalance in some fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats administered liraglutide during organogenesis at doses that approximate clinical exposures at the maximum Confidential recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.8 mg/day. In pregnant rabbits administered liraglutide during organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of major fetal abnormalities were seen at exposures below the human exposures at the MRHD [see Animal Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects for women with uncontrolled pre-gestational diabetes (Hemoglobin A 1C >7) is 6 to 10%. The major birth defect rate has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a Hemoglobin A 1C >10. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Animal Data Female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide beginning 2 weeks before mating through gestation day 17 had estimated systemic exposures 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times the human exposure at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. The number of early embryonic deaths in the 1 mg/kg/day group increased slightly. Fetal abnormalities and variations in kidneys and blood vessels, irregular ossification of the skull, and a more complete state of ossification occurred at all doses. Mottled liver and minimally kinked ribs occurred at the highest dose. The incidence of fetal malformations in liraglutide-treated groups exceeding concurrent and historical controls were misshapen oropharynx and/or narrowed opening into larynx at 0.1 mg/kg/day and umbilical hernia at 0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg/day. Pregnant rabbits given subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through day 18 inclusive, had estimated systemic exposures less than the human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day at all doses, based on plasma AUC. Liraglutide decreased fetal weight and dose-dependently increased the incidence of total major fetal abnormalities at all doses. The incidence of malformations exceeded concurrent and historical controls at 0.01 mg/kg/day (kidneys, scapula), \u2265 0.01 mg/kg/day (eyes, forelimb), 0.025 mg/kg/day (brain, tail and sacral vertebrae, major blood vessels and heart, umbilicus), \u2265 0.025 mg/kg/day (sternum) and at 0.05 mg/kg/day (parietal bones, major blood vessels). Irregular ossification and/or skeletal abnormalities occurred in the skull and jaw, vertebrae and ribs, sternum, pelvis, tail, and scapula; and dose-dependent minor skeletal variations were observed. Visceral abnormalities occurred in blood vessels, lung, liver, and esophagus. Bilobed or bifurcated gallbladder was seen in all treatment groups, but not in the control group. In pregnant female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through weaning or termination of nursing on lactation day 24, estimated systemic exposures were 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day, based on plasma AUC. A slight delay in parturition was observed in the majority of treated rats. Group mean body weight of neonatal rats from liraglutide-treated dams was lower than neonatal rats from control group dams. Bloody scabs and agitated behavior occurred in male rats descended from dams treated with 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide. Group mean body weight from birth to postpartum day 14 trended lower in F2 generation rats descended from liraglutide-treated rats compared to F2 generation rats descended from controls, but differences did not reach statistical significance for any group. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of liraglutide injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Liraglutide was present in milk of lactating rats [see Data]. Developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for liraglutide injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liraglutide injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In lactating rats, liraglutide was present unchanged in milk at concentrations approximately 50% of maternal plasma concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide injection as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older. Use of liraglutide injection for this indication is supported by a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial and a 26-week open-label extension in 134 pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a pediatric pharmacokinetic study, and studies in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1,14.2)]. The risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection in pediatric patients regardless of insulin and/or metformin use [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide injection have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the liraglutide injection treatment arms of the glycemic control trials, a total of 832 (19.3%) of the patients were 65 to 74 years of age and 145 (3.4%) were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness for liraglutide injection have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of liraglutide injection is recommended for patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The safety and efficacy of liraglutide injection was evaluated in a 26-week clinical study that included patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. There is limited experience with liraglutide injection in patients with end stage renal disease. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Use caution in patients who experience dehydration. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There is limited experience in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, liraglutide injection should be used with caution in this patient population. No dose adjustment of liraglutide injection is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.8 Gastroparesis Liraglutide injection slows gastric emptying. Liraglutide injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing gastroparesis."

      "Liraglutide Injection contains liraglutide, an analog of human GLP-1 and acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Liraglutide Injection contains chemically synthesized Liraglutide that has been engineered to be 97% homologous to native human GLP-1 by substituting arginine for lysine at position 34. Liraglutide is made by attaching a C-16 fatty acid (palmitic acid) with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26 of the peptide precursor.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Liraglutide is an acylated human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37). GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-IV and NEP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide injection\u2019s pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide injection lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide injection or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide injection 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) liraglutide injection on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner (Figure 2). Figure 2 Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide Injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide injection lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single dose of liraglutide injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide injection causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide injection on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide injection at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to 12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide injection, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide injection is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide injection using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide injection in the pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide injection compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide injection provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5 to 6) to severe (Child Pugh score > 9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide injection has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that Cmax of liraglutide injection (8 to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; Cmax decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (Tmax) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The co-administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; Cmax decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median Tmax was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide injection. Atorvastatin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38% and median Tmax was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide injection. Acetaminophen Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1,000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Acetaminophen Cmax was decreased by 31% and median Tmax was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide injection at steady state. Griseofulvin Cmax increased by 37% while median Tmax did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Liraglutide injection lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide injection on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide injection increased the levonorgestrel AUC0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide injection delayed Tmax for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide injection and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those with liraglutide injection or other liraglutide products. A subset of liraglutide injection-treated patients (1,104 of 2,501, 44%) in five adult double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] and 102/1,104 (9%) of liraglutide injection-treated patients developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Of these 102 liraglutide injection-treated patients, 56 (5%) patients developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 12 (1%) of the liraglutide injection-treated patients. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-liraglutide antibodies on effectiveness of liraglutide injection. In five double-blind adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of liraglutide injection-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for liraglutide injection-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. In a clinical trial with pediatric patients aged 10 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 1 (2%) liraglutide injection-treated patient at week 26 and 5 (9%) liraglutide injection-treated patients at week 53. None of the 5 patients had antibodies cross reactive to native GLP-1 or had neutralizing antibodies. Figure 2"

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female CD-1 mice at doses of 0.03, 0.2, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection yielding systemic exposures 0.2-, 2-, 10- and 45-times the human exposure, respectively, at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day based on plasma AUC comparison. A dose-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in the 1.0 and the 3.0 mg/kg/day groups with incidences of 13% and 19% in males and 6% and 20% in females, respectively. C-cell adenomas did not occur in control groups or 0.03 and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. Treatment-related malignant C-cell carcinomas occurred in 3% of females in the 3.0 mg/kg/day group. Thyroid C-cell tumors are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in mice. A treatment-related increase in fibrosarcomas was seen on the dorsal skin and subcutis, the body surface used for drug injection, in males in the 3 mg/kg/day group. These fibrosarcomas were attributed to the high local concentration of drug near the injection site. The liraglutide concentration in the clinical formulation (6 mg/mL) is 10-times higher than the concentration in the formulation used to administer 3 mg/kg/day liraglutide to mice in the carcinogenicity study (0.6 mg/mL). A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0.075, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection with exposures 0.5-, 2- and 8-times the human exposure, respectively, resulting from the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. A treatment-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in males in 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide groups with incidences of 12%, 16%, 42%, and 46% and in all female liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 10%, 27%, 33%, and 56% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. A treatment-related increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in all male liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 2%, 8%, 6%, and 14% and in females at 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day with incidences of 0%, 0%, 4%, and 6% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. Thyroid C-cell carcinomas are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in rats. Studies in mice demonstrated that liraglutide-induced C-cell proliferation was dependent on the GLP-1 receptor and that liraglutide did not cause activation of the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene in thyroid C-cells. Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats is unknown and has not been determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Liraglutide was negative with and without metabolic activation in the Ames test for mutagenicity and in a human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test for clastogenicity. Liraglutide was negative in repeat-dose in vivo micronucleus tests in rats. In rat fertility studies using subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating until gestation day 17. No direct adverse effects on male fertility was observed at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day, a high dose yielding an estimated systemic exposure 11- times the human exposure at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC. In female rats, an increase in early embryonic deaths occurred at 1.0 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain and food consumption were observed in females at the 1.0 mg/kg/day dose."

      "14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In glycemic control trials in adults, liraglutide injection has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with one or two oral anti-diabetic medications or basal insulin. In each of the placebo controlled trials, treatment with liraglutide injection produced clinically and statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo. All liraglutide injection-treated patients started at 0.6 mg/day. The dose was increased in weekly intervals by 0.6 mg to reach 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg for patients randomized to these higher doses. Liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is not effective for glycemic control and is intended only as a starting dose to reduce gastrointestinal intolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Monotherapy In this 52-week trial, 746 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, or glimepiride 8 mg. Patients who were randomized to glimepiride were initially treated with 2 mg daily for two weeks, increasing to 4 mg daily for another two weeks, and finally increasing to 8 mg daily. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and 1.2 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c compared to glimepiride (Table 3). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.6% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg treatment group, 6.0% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg treatment group, and 10.1% in the glimepiride-treatment group. The mean age of participants was 53 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 5 years. Participants were 49.7% male, 77.5% White, 12.6% Black or African American and 35.0% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.1 kg/m 2 . Table 3 Results of a 52-week Monotherapy Trial in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Figure 3 Mean HbA 1c for Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who Completed the 52-week Trial and for the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF, intent-to-treat) data at Week 52 (Monotherapy) Combination Therapy Add-on to Metformin In this 26-week trial, 1,091 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 0.6 mg, liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, placebo, or glimepiride 4 mg (one-half of the maximal approved dose in the United States), all as add-on to metformin. Randomization occurred after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week initial forced metformin titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin were increased up to 2,000 mg/day. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to metformin resulted in a significant mean HbA1c reduction relative to placebo add-on to metformin and resulted in a similar mean HbA1c reduction relative to glimepiride 4 mg add-on to metformin (Table 4). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 5.4% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin treatment group, 3.3% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + metformin treatment group, 23.8% in the placebo + metformin treatment group, and 3.7% in the glimepiride + metformin treated group. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 7 years. Participants were 58.2% male, 87.1% White and 2.4% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 31.0 kg/m2. Table 4 Results of a 26-week Trial of Liraglutide Injection as Add-on to Metformin in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Liraglutide Injection Compared to Sitagliptin, Both as Add-on to Metformin In this 26-week, open-label trial, 665 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on a background of metformin \u22651,500 mg per day were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.2 mg once daily, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg once daily or sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, all dosed according to approved labeling. Patients were to continue their current treatment on metformin at a stable, pre-trial dose level and dosing frequency. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 6 years. Participants were 52.9% male, 86.6% White, 7.2% Black or African American and 16.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.8 kg/m 2 . The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c relative to sitagliptin 100 mg (Table 5). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.1% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg group, 0.5% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg treatment group, and 4.1% in the sitagliptin 100 mg treatment group. From a mean baseline body weight of 94 kg, there was a mean reduction of 2.7 kg for liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, 3.3 kg for liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, and 0.8 kg for sitagliptin 100 mg. Table 5 Results of a 26-week Open-label Trial of Liraglutide Injection Compared to Sitagliptin (both in combination with metformin) in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Figure 4 Mean HbA 1c for Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who Completed the 26-week Trial and for the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF, intent-to-treat) data at Week 26 Combination Therapy with Metformin and Insulin This 26-week open-label trial enrolled 988 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control (HbA 1c 7-10%) on metformin (\u22651,500 mg/day) alone or inadequate glycemic control (HbA 1c 7-8.5%) on metformin (\u22651,500 mg/day) and a sulfonylurea. Patients who were on metformin and a sulfonylurea discontinued the sulfonylurea then all patients entered a 12-week run-in period during which they received add-on therapy with liraglutide injection titrated to 1.8 mg once-daily. At the end of the run-in period, 498 patients (50%) achieved HbA1c <7% with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin and continued treatment in a non-randomized, observational arm. Another 167 patients (17%) withdrew from the trial during the run-in period with approximately one-half of these patients doing so because of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The remaining 323 patients with HbA 1c \u22657% (33% of those who entered the run-in period) were randomized to 26 weeks of once-daily insulin detemir administered in the evening as add-on therapy (N=162) or to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin (N=161). The starting dose of insulin detemir was 10 units/day and the mean dose at the end of the 26-week randomized period was 39 units/day. During the 26 week randomized treatment period, the percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 11.2% in the group randomized to continued treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin and 1.2% in the group randomized to add-on therapy with insulin detemir. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 55.7% male, 91.3% White, 5.6% Black or African American and 12.5% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 34.0 kg/m2. Treatment with insulin detemir as add-on to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c and FPG compared to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin alone (Table 6). From a mean baseline body weight of 96 kg after randomization, there was a mean reduction of 0.3 kg in the patients who received insulin detemir add-on therapy compared to a mean reduction of 1.1 kg in the patients who continued on unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin alone. Table 6 Results of a 26-week Open-label Trial of Insulin detemir as add on to Liraglutide Injection + Metformin Compared to Continued Treatment with Liraglutide Injection + Metformin alone in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus not Achieving HbA 1c < 7% after 12 weeks of Metformin and Liraglutide Injection a Add-on to Sulfonylurea In this 26-week trial, 1,041 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 0.6 mg, liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, placebo, or rosiglitazone 4 mg (one-half of the maximal approved dose in the United States), all as add-on to glimepiride. Randomization occurred after a 4-week run-in period consisting of an initial, 2-week, forced-glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 2 weeks. During the titration period, doses of glimepiride were increased to 4 mg/day. The doses of glimepiride could be reduced (at the discretion of the investigator) from 4 mg/day to 3 mg/day or 2 mg/day (minimum) after randomization, in the event of unacceptable hypoglycemia or other adverse events. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 49.4% male, 64.4% White and 2.8% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 29.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride (Table 7). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.0% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 3.5% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 17.5% in the placebo + glimepiride treatment group, and 6.9% in the rosiglitazone + glimepiride treatment group. Table 7 Results of a 26-week Trial of Liraglutide Injection as add-on to Sulfonylurea in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Add-on to Metformin and Sulfonylurea In this 26-week trial, 581 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, placebo, or insulin glargine, all as add-on to metformin and glimepiride. Randomization took place after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week forced metformin and glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin and glimepiride were to be increased up to 2,000 mg/day and 4 mg/day, respectively. After randomization, patients randomized to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg underwent a 2 week period of titration with liraglutide injection. During the trial, the liraglutide injection and metformin doses were fixed, although glimepiride and insulin glargine doses could be adjusted. Patients titrated glargine twice-weekly during the first 8 weeks of treatment based on self-measured fasting plasma glucose on the day of titration. After Week 8, the frequency of insulin glargine titration was left to the discretion of the investigator, but, at a minimum, the glargine dose was to be revised, if necessary, at Weeks 12 and 18. Only 20% of glargine-treated patients achieved the pre-specified target fasting plasma glucose of \u2264100 mg/dL. Therefore, optimal titration of the insulin glargine dose was not achieved in most patients. The mean age of participants was 58 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 56.5% male, 75.0% White and 3.6% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 30.5 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection as add-on to glimepiride and metformin resulted in a statistically significant mean reduction in HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride and metformin (Table 8). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 0.9% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, 0.4% in the insulin glargine + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, and 11.3% in the placebo + metformin + glimepiride treatment group. Table 8 Results of a 26-week Trial of Liraglutide Injection as Add-on to Metformin and Sulfonylurea in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Liraglutide Injection Compared to Exenatide, Both as Add-on to Metformin and/or Sulfonylurea Therapy In this 26-week, open-label trial, 464 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on a background of metformin monotherapy, sulfonylurea monotherapy or a combination of metformin and sulfonylurea were randomized to once daily liraglutide injection 1.8 mg or exenatide 10 mcg twice daily. Maximally tolerated doses of background therapy were to remain unchanged for the duration of the trial. Patients randomized to exenatide started on a dose of 5 mcg twice-daily for 4 weeks and then were escalated to 10 mcg twice daily. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 51.9% male, 91.8% White, 5.4% Black or African American and 12.3% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG relative to exenatide (Table 9). The percentage of patients who discontinued for ineffective therapy was 0.4% in the liraglutide injection treatment group and 0% in the exenatide treatment group. Both treatment groups had a mean decrease from baseline in body weight of approximately 3 kg. Table 9 Results of a 26-week Open-label trial of Liraglutide Injection versus Exenatide (both in combination with metformin and/or sulfonylurea) in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Add-on to Metformin and Thiazolidinedione In this 26-week trial, 533 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg or placebo, all as add-on to rosiglitazone (8 mg) plus metformin (2,000 mg). Patients underwent a 9 week run-in period (3-week forced dose escalation followed by a 6-week dose maintenance phase) with rosiglitazone (starting at 4 mg and increasing to 8 mg/day within 2 weeks) and metformin (starting at 500 mg with increasing weekly increments of 500 mg to a final dose of 2,000 mg/day). Only patients who tolerated the final dose of rosiglitazone (8 mg/day) and metformin (2,000 mg/day) and completed the 6-week dose maintenance phase were eligible for randomization into the trial. The mean age of participants was 55 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 61.6% male, 84.2% White, 10.2% Black or African American and 16.4% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection as add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone produced a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA1c compared to placebo add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 10). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 1.7% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, 1.7% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, and 16.4% in the placebo + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group. Table 10 Results of a 26-week Trial of Liraglutide Injection as Add-on to Metformin and Thiazolidinedione in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Liraglutide Injection Compared to Placebo Both With or Without metformin and/or Sulfonylurea and/or Pioglitazone and/or Basal or Premix insulin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Moderate Renal Impairment In this 26-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 279 patients with moderate renal impairment, as per MDRD formula (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2), were randomized to liraglutide injection or placebo once daily. Liraglutide injection was added to the patient\u2019s stable pre-trial antidiabetic regimen (insulin therapy and/or metformin, pioglitazone, or sulfonylurea). The dose of liraglutide injection was escalated according to approved labeling to achieve a dose of 1.8 mg per day. The insulin dose was reduced by 20% at randomization for patients with baseline HbA 1c \u2264 8% and fixed until liraglutide dose escalation was complete. Dose reduction of insulin and SU was allowed in case of hypoglycemia; up titration of insulin was allowed but not beyond the pre-trial dose. The mean age of participants was 67 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Participants were 50.5% male, 92.3% White, 6.6% Black or African American, and 7.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m2. Approximately half of patients had an eGFR between 30 and <45mL/min/1.73 m2. Treatment with liraglutide injection resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c from baseline at Week 26 compared to placebo (see Table 11). 123 patients reached the 1.8 mg dose of liraglutide injection. Table 11 Results of a 26-week Trial of Liraglutide Injection Compared to Placebo in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Moderate Renal Impairment a 14.2 Glycemic Control Trial in Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Liraglutide injection was evaluated in a 26-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo controlled multicenter trial (NCT01541215), in 134 pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 10 years and older. Patients were randomized to liraglutide injection once-daily or placebo once-daily in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin treatment. All patients were on a metformin dose of 1,000 to 2,000 mg prior to randomization. The basal insulin dose was decreased by 20% at randomization and liraglutide injection was titrated weekly by 0.6 mg for 2 to 3 weeks based on tolerability and an average fasting plasma glucose goal of \u2264110 mg/dL. The mean age was 14.6 years: 29.9% were ages 10 to 14 years, and 70.1% were greater than 14 years of age. 38.1% were male, 64.9% were White, 13.4% were Asian, 11.9% were Black or African American; 29.1% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m2 and the mean BMI SDS was 2.9. 18.7% of patients were using basal insulin at baseline. The mean duration of diabetes was 1.9 years and the mean HbA 1c was 7.8%. At week 26, treatment with liraglutide injection was superior in reducing HbA1c from baseline versus placebo. The estimated treatment difference in HbA 1c reduction from baseline between liraglutide injection and placebo was -1.06% with a 95% confidence interval of [-1.65%; -0.46%] (see Table 12).

      "Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Inform patients that liraglutide causes benign and malignant thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats and that the human relevance of this finding is unknown. Counsel patients to report symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a lump in the neck, hoarseness, dysphagia, or dyspnea) to their physician [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Pancreatitis Inform patients of the potential risk for pancreatitis. Explain that persistent severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to discontinue Liraglutide injection promptly and contact their physician if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients Advise patients that they must never share a liraglutide injection pen with another person, even if the needle is changed, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hypoglycemia Inform patients that hypoglycemia has been reported when liraglutide injection is used with insulin secretagogues or insulin and may occur in pediatric patients regardless of concomitant antidiabetic treatment. Educate patients or caregivers on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Kidney Injury Advise patients of the potential risk of dehydration due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and to take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. Inform patients of the potential risk for worsening renal function, which in some cases may require dialysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients that serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of liraglutide injection. Advise patients on the symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and instruct them to stop taking liraglutide injection and seek medical advice promptly if such symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Acute Gallbladder Disease Inform patients of the potential risk for cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. Instruct patients to contact their physician if cholelithiasis or cholecystitis is suspected for appropriate clinical follow-up [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation Inform patients that liraglutide injection may cause their stomach to empty more slowly which may lead to complications with anesthesia or deep sedation during planned surgeries or procedures. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking liraglutide injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Missed Dose Inform patients not to take an extra dose of liraglutide injection to make up for a missed dose. If a dose is missed, the once-daily regimen should be resumed as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last dose, advise the patient to reinitiate liraglutide injection at 0.6 mg to mitigate any gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment. Liraglutide injection should be titrated at the discretion of the healthcare provider [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Manufactured by: Hybio Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2.1 Recommended Dosage Adult Patients \u2022 The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide injection is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for one week. The 0.6 mg once daily dosage is intended to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] during initial titration and is not effective for glycemic control in adults. \u2022 After one week at the 0.6 mg once daily dosage, increase the dosage to 1.2 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. \u2022 If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage to the maximum recommended dosage of 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily after at least one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg once daily dosage. Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older \u2022 The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide injection is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. \u2022 If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage in 0.6 mg increments after at least one week on the current dosage. \u2022 The maximum recommended dosage is 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. 2.2 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose \u2022 Instruct patients who miss a dose of liraglutide injection to resume the once -daily dosage regimen as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Do not administer an extra dose or increase the dose to make up for the missed dose. \u2022 If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last liraglutide injection dose, reinitiate liraglutide injection at 0.6 mg once daily to mitigate any gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment. Upon reinitiation, liraglutide injection should be titrated at the discretion of the healthcare provider. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions \u2022 Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles. \u2022 Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously once daily at any time of day, independently of meals. \u2022 Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. No dosage adjustment is needed if changing the injection site and/or timing. \u2022 Rotate injection sites within the same region in order to reduce the risk of cutaneous amyloidosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. \u2022 When using liraglutide injection with insulin, administer as separate injections. Never mix. It is acceptable to inject liraglutide injection and insulin in the same body region but the injections should not be adjacent to each other."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Malignant thyroid Ccell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether liraglutide injection will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and liraglutide injection use in humans. Liraglutide injection is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of liraglutide injection and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated. 5.2 Pancreatitis Based on spontaneous postmarketing reports, acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with liraglutide injection. After initiation of liraglutide injection, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, liraglutide injection should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, liraglutide injection should not be restarted. In glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there have been 13 cases of pancreatitis among liraglutide injectiontreated patients and 1 case in a comparator (glimepiride) treated patient (2.7 vs. 0.5 cases per 1,000 patient-years). Nine of the 13 cases with liraglutide injection were reported as acute pancreatitis and four were reported as chronic pancreatitis. In one case in a liraglutide injection-treated patient, pancreatitis, with necrosis, was observed and led to death; however clinical causality could not be established. Some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse. Liraglutide injection has been studied in a limited number of patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown if patients with a history of pancreatitis are at higher risk for development of pancreatitis on liraglutide injection. 5.3 Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients Liraglutide injection pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Adult patients receiving liraglutide injection in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection regardless of insulin and/or metformin use. [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7.2)]. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications and pediatric patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.5 Acute Kidney Injury Liraglutide injection has not been found to be directly nephrotoxic in animal studies or clinical trials. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis in liraglutide injection-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Some of the reported events occurred in patients receiving one or more medications known to affect renal function or hydration status. Altered renal function has been reversed in many of the reported cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including liraglutide injection. Use caution when initiating or escalating doses of liraglutide injection in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with liraglutide injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue liraglutide injection; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with liraglutide injection. Liraglutide injection is contraindicated in patients who have had a serious hypersensitivity reaction to liraglutide or any of the excipients in liraglutide injection [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Acute Gallbladder Disease Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation Liraglutide injection delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations. Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking liraglutide injection, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing liraglutide injection could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking liraglutide injection."

      "The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information: \u2022 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \u2022 Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \u2022 Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] \u2022 Acute Kidney Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] \u2022 Acute Gallbladder Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] \u2022 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Common Adverse Reactions The safety of liraglutide injection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in 5 glycemic control, placebocontrolled trials in adults and one trial of 52 weeks duration in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The data in Table 1 reflect exposure of 1,673 adult patients to liraglutide injection and a mean duration of exposure to liraglutide injection of 37.3 weeks. The mean age of adult patients was 58 years, 4% were 75 years or older and 54% were male. The population was 79% White, 6% Black or African American, 13% Asian; 4% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years and a mean HbA1c of 8.4%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% and moderately impaired in 12% of the pooled population. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions in adults, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of liraglutide injection for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on liraglutide injection than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with liraglutide injection. Overall, the type, and severity of adverse reactions in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older and above were comparable to that observed in the adult population. Table 1 Adverse reactions reported in \u2265 5% of Adult Patients Treated with Liraglutide Injection for Type 2 In an analysis of placebo- and active-controlled trials, the types and frequency of common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, were similar to those listed in Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions In the pool of 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled adult clinical trials, withdrawals due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions, occurred in 4.3% of liraglutide injection-treated patients and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Withdrawal due to gastrointestinal adverse events mainly occurred during the first 2 to 3 months of the trials. Injection site reactions Injection site reactions (e.g., injection site rash, erythema) were reported in approximately 2% of liraglutide injection-treated adult patients in the five double-blind, glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration. Less than 0.2% of liraglutide injection-treated patients discontinued due to injection site reactions. Hypoglycemia In 5 adult glycemic control, placebo-controlled clinical trials of at least 26 weeks duration, hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person for treatment occurred in 8 liraglutide injection-treated patients (7.5 events per 1,000 patient-years). Of these 8 liraglutide injection-treated patients, 7 patients were concomitantly using a sulfonylurea. Table 2 Adult Incidence (%) and Rate (episodes/patient year) of Hypoglycemia in 26-Week Combination Therapy Placebo-controlled Trials In a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with a 26-week open-label extension, 21.2% of liraglutide injection-treated patients (mean age 14.6 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus, had hypoglycemia with a blood glucose <54 mg/dL with or without symptoms (335 events per 1,000 patient years). No severe hypoglycemic episodes occurred in the liraglutide injection treatment group (severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions). Papillary thyroid carcinoma In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there were 7 reported cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma in patients treated with liraglutide injection and 1 case in a comparator-treated patient (1.5 vs. 0.5 cases per 1,000 patient-years). Most of these papillary thyroid carcinomas were <1 cm in greatest diameter and were diagnosed in surgical pathology specimens after thyroidectomy prompted by findings on protocol-specified screening with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, the incidence of cholelithiasis was 0.3% in both liraglutide injection-treated and placebo-treated patients. The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.2% in both liraglutide injection-treated and placebo-treated patients. Laboratory Tests Bilirubin In the five adult glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration, mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (elevations to no more than twice the upper limit of the reference range) occurred in 4.0% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 2.1% of placebo-treated patients and 3.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. This finding was not accompanied by abnormalities in other liver tests. The significance of this isolated finding is unknown. Calcitonin Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program. At the end of the adult glycemic control trials, adjusted mean serum calcitonin concentrations were higher in liraglutide injection-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients but not compared to patients receiving active comparator. Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less. Among adult patients with pretreatment calcitonin <20 ng/L, calcitonin elevations to >20 ng/L occurred in 0.7% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, and 0.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Lipase and Amylase In one adult glycemic control trial in renal impairment patients, a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed for liraglutide injection-treated patients while placebo-treated patients had a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with liraglutide injection is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Vital signs Liraglutide injection did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed in adult patients treated with liraglutide injection compared to placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of liraglutide injection. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal: Acute pancreatitis, hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis sometimes resulting in death, ileus General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Allergic reactions: rash and pruritus Hepatobiliary: Elevations of liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy, hepatitis Immune system: Angioedema and anaphylactic reactions Metabolism and nutrition: Dehydration resulting from nausea, vomiting and diarrhea Neoplasms: Medullary thyroid carcinoma Nervous system: Dysgeusia, dizziness Pulmonary: Pulmonary aspiration has occurred in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation. Renal and urinary: Increased serum creatinine, acute renal failure or worsening of chronic renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis Skin and subcutaneous tissue: Cutaneous amyloidosis Table 1 Adverse reactions reported in \u2265 5% of Adult Patients Treated with Liraglutide Injection for Type 2 Table 2 Adult Incidence (%) and Rate (episodes/patient year) of Hypoglycemia in 26-Week Combination Therapy Placebo-controlled Trials"

      "7.1 Effects of Delayed Gastric Emptying on Oral Medications Liraglutide injection causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials, liraglutide injection did not affect the absorption of the tested orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with liraglutide injection. 7.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin Liraglutide injection stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. Patients receiving liraglutide injection in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. When initiating liraglutide injection, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to liraglutide injection during pregnancy. Liraglutide injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal reproduction studies identified increased adverse developmental outcomes from exposure during pregnancy. Liraglutide exposure was associated with early embryonic deaths and an imbalance in some fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats administered liraglutide during organogenesis at doses that approximate clinical exposures at the maximum Confidential recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.8 mg/day. In pregnant rabbits administered liraglutide during organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of major fetal abnormalities were seen at exposures below the human exposures at the MRHD [see Animal Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects for women with uncontrolled pre-gestational diabetes (Hemoglobin A 1C >7) is 6 to 10%. The major birth defect rate has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a Hemoglobin A 1C >10. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Animal Data Female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide beginning 2 weeks before mating through gestation day 17 had estimated systemic exposures 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times the human exposure at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. The number of early embryonic deaths in the 1 mg/kg/day group increased slightly. Fetal abnormalities and variations in kidneys and blood vessels, irregular ossification of the skull, and a more complete state of ossification occurred at all doses. Mottled liver and minimally kinked ribs occurred at the highest dose. The incidence of fetal malformations in liraglutide-treated groups exceeding concurrent and historical controls were misshapen oropharynx and/or narrowed opening into larynx at 0.1 mg/kg/day and umbilical hernia at 0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg/day. Pregnant rabbits given subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through day 18 inclusive, had estimated systemic exposures less than the human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day at all doses, based on plasma AUC. Liraglutide decreased fetal weight and dose-dependently increased the incidence of total major fetal abnormalities at all doses. The incidence of malformations exceeded concurrent and historical controls at 0.01 mg/kg/day (kidneys, scapula), \u2265 0.01 mg/kg/day (eyes, forelimb), 0.025 mg/kg/day (brain, tail and sacral vertebrae, major blood vessels and heart, umbilicus), \u2265 0.025 mg/kg/day (sternum) and at 0.05 mg/kg/day (parietal bones, major blood vessels). Irregular ossification and/or skeletal abnormalities occurred in the skull and jaw, vertebrae and ribs, sternum, pelvis, tail, and scapula; and dose-dependent minor skeletal variations were observed. Visceral abnormalities occurred in blood vessels, lung, liver, and esophagus. Bilobed or bifurcated gallbladder was seen in all treatment groups, but not in the control group. In pregnant female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through weaning or termination of nursing on lactation day 24, estimated systemic exposures were 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day, based on plasma AUC. A slight delay in parturition was observed in the majority of treated rats. Group mean body weight of neonatal rats from liraglutide-treated dams was lower than neonatal rats from control group dams. Bloody scabs and agitated behavior occurred in male rats descended from dams treated with 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide. Group mean body weight from birth to postpartum day 14 trended lower in F2 generation rats descended from liraglutide-treated rats compared to F2 generation rats descended from controls, but differences did not reach statistical significance for any group. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of liraglutide injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Liraglutide was present in milk of lactating rats [see Data]. Developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for liraglutide injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liraglutide injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In lactating rats, liraglutide was present unchanged in milk at concentrations approximately 50% of maternal plasma concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide injection as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older. Use of liraglutide injection for this indication is supported by a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial and a 26-week open-label extension in 134 pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a pediatric pharmacokinetic study, and studies in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1,14.2)]. The risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection in pediatric patients regardless of insulin and/or metformin use [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide injection have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the liraglutide injection treatment arms of the glycemic control trials, a total of 832 (19.3%) of the patients were 65 to 74 years of age and 145 (3.4%) were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness for liraglutide injection have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of liraglutide injection is recommended for patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The safety and efficacy of liraglutide injection was evaluated in a 26-week clinical study that included patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. There is limited experience with liraglutide injection in patients with end stage renal disease. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Use caution in patients who experience dehydration. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There is limited experience in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, liraglutide injection should be used with caution in this patient population. No dose adjustment of liraglutide injection is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.8 Gastroparesis Liraglutide injection slows gastric emptying. Liraglutide injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing gastroparesis."

      "Liraglutide Injection contains liraglutide, an analog of human GLP-1 and acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Liraglutide Injection contains chemically synthesized Liraglutide that has been engineered to be 97% homologous to native human GLP-1 by substituting arginine for lysine at position 34. Liraglutide is made by attaching a C-16 fatty acid (palmitic acid) with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26 of the peptide precursor. The molecular formula of liraglutide is C172H265N43O51 and the molecular weight is 3751.2 Daltons. The structural formula (Figure 1) is: Figure 1 Structural Formula of liraglutide Liraglutide Injection is a sterile, aqueous, clear, colorless or almost colorless solution for subcutaneous use. Each 1 mL of Liraglutide Injection solution contains 6 mg of liraglutide and the following inactive ingredients: disodium phosphate dihydrate, 1.42 mg; propylene glycol, 14 mg; phenol, 5.5 mg; and water for injection. Liraglutide Injection has a pH of approximately 8.15, hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH. Each pre-filled pen contains a 3 mL solution of Liraglutide Injection equivalent to 18 mg liraglutide (free-base, anhydrous). Figure 1 Structural Formula of liraglutide"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Liraglutide is an acylated human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37). GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-IV and NEP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide injection\u2019s pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide injection lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide injection or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide injection 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) liraglutide injection on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner (Figure 2). Figure 2 Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide Injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide injection lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single dose of liraglutide injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide injection causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide injection on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide injection at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to 12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide injection, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide injection is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide injection using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide injection in the pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide injection compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide injection provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5 to 6) to severe (Child Pugh score > 9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide injection has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that Cmax of liraglutide injection (8 to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; Cmax decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (Tmax) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The co-administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; Cmax decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median Tmax was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide injection. Atorvastatin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38% and median Tmax was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide injection. Acetaminophen Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1,000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Acetaminophen Cmax was decreased by 31% and median Tmax was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide injection at steady state. Griseofulvin Cmax increased by 37% while median Tmax did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Liraglutide injection lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide injection on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide injection increased the levonorgestrel AUC0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide injection delayed Tmax for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide injection and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those with liraglutide injection or other liraglutide products. A subset of liraglutide injection-treated patients (1,104 of 2,501, 44%) in five adult double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] and 102/1,104 (9%) of liraglutide injection-treated patients developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Of these 102 liraglutide injection-treated patients, 56 (5%) patients developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 12 (1%) of the liraglutide injection-treated patients. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-liraglutide antibodies on effectiveness of liraglutide injection. In five double-blind adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of liraglutide injection-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for liraglutide injection-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. In a clinical trial with pediatric patients aged 10 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 1 (2%) liraglutide injection-treated patient at week 26 and 5 (9%) liraglutide injection-treated patients at week 53. None of the 5 patients had antibodies cross reactive to native GLP-1 or had neutralizing antibodies. Figure 2"

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female CD-1 mice at doses of 0.03, 0.2, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection yielding systemic exposures 0.2-, 2-, 10- and 45-times the human exposure, respectively, at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day based on plasma AUC comparison. A dose-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in the 1.0 and the 3.0 mg/kg/day groups with incidences of 13% and 19% in males and 6% and 20% in females, respectively. C-cell adenomas did not occur in control groups or 0.03 and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. Treatment-related malignant C-cell carcinomas occurred in 3% of females in the 3.0 mg/kg/day group. Thyroid C-cell tumors are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in mice. A treatment-related increase in fibrosarcomas was seen on the dorsal skin and subcutis, the body surface used for drug injection, in males in the 3 mg/kg/day group. These fibrosarcomas were attributed to the high local concentration of drug near the injection site. The liraglutide concentration in the clinical formulation (6 mg/mL) is 10-times higher than the concentration in the formulation used to administer 3 mg/kg/day liraglutide to mice in the carcinogenicity study (0.6 mg/mL). A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0.075, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection with exposures 0.5-, 2- and 8-times the human exposure, respectively, resulting from the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. A treatment-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in males in 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide groups with incidences of 12%, 16%, 42%, and 46% and in all female liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 10%, 27%, 33%, and 56% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. A treatment-related increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in all male liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 2%, 8%, 6%, and 14% and in females at 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day with incidences of 0%, 0%, 4%, and 6% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. Thyroid C-cell carcinomas are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in rats. Studies in mice demonstrated that liraglutide-induced C-cell proliferation was dependent on the GLP-1 receptor and that liraglutide did not cause activation of the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene in thyroid C-cells. Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats is unknown and has not been determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Liraglutide was negative with and without metabolic activation in the Ames test for mutagenicity and in a human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test for clastogenicity. Liraglutide was negative in repeat-dose in vivo micronucleus tests in rats. In rat fertility studies using subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating until gestation day 17. No direct adverse effects on male fertility was observed at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day, a high dose yielding an estimated systemic exposure 11- times the human exposure at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC. In female rats, an increase in early embryonic deaths occurred at 1.0 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain and food consumption were observed in females at the 1.0 mg/kg/day dose."

      "14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In glycemic control trials in adults, liraglutide injection has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with one or two oral anti-diabetic medications or basal insulin. In each of the placebo controlled trials, treatment with liraglutide injection produced clinically and statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo. All liraglutide injection-treated patients started at 0.6 mg/day. The dose was increased in weekly intervals by 0.6 mg to reach 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg for patients randomized to these higher doses. Liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is not effective for glycemic control and is intended only as a starting dose to reduce gastrointestinal intolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Monotherapy In this 52-week trial, 746 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, or glimepiride 8 mg. Patients who were randomized to glimepiride were initially treated with 2 mg daily for two weeks, increasing to 4 mg daily for another two weeks, and finally increasing to 8 mg daily. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and 1.2 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c compared to glimepiride (Table 3). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.6% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg treatment group, 6.0% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg treatment group, and 10.1% in the glimepiride-treatment group. The mean age of participants was 53 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 5 years. Participants were 49.7% male, 77.5% White, 12.6% Black or African American and 35.0% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.1 kg/m 2 . Table 3 Results of a 52-week Monotherapy Trial in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Figure 3 Mean HbA 1c for Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who Completed the 52-week Trial and for the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF, intent-to-treat) data at Week 52 (Monotherapy) Combination Therapy Add-on to Metformin In this 26-week trial, 1,091 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 0.6 mg, liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, placebo, or glimepiride 4 mg (one-half of the maximal approved dose in the United States), all as add-on to metformin. Randomization occurred after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week initial forced metformin titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin were increased up to 2,000 mg/day. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to metformin resulted in a significant mean HbA1c reduction relative to placebo add-on to metformin and resulted in a similar mean HbA1c reduction relative to glimepiride 4 mg add-on to metformin (Table 4). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 5.4% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin treatment group, 3.3% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + metformin treatment group, 23.8% in the placebo + metformin treatment group, and 3.7% in the glimepiride + metformin treated group. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 7 years. Participants were 58.2% male, 87.1% White and 2.4% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 31.0 kg/m2. Table 4 Results of a 26-week Trial of Liraglutide Injection as Add-on to Metformin in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Liraglutide Injection Compared to Sitagliptin, Both as Add-on to Metformin In this 26-week, open-label trial, 665 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on a background of metformin \u22651,500 mg per day were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.2 mg once daily, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg once daily or sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, all dosed according to approved labeling. Patients were to continue their current treatment on metformin at a stable, pre-trial dose level and dosing frequency. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 6 years. Participants were 52.9% male, 86.6% White, 7.2% Black or African American and 16.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.8 kg/m 2 . The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c relative to sitagliptin 100 mg (Table 5). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.1% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg group, 0.5% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg treatment group, and 4.1% in the sitagliptin 100 mg treatment group. From a mean baseline body weight of 94 kg, there was a mean reduction of 2.7 kg for liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, 3.3 kg for liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, and 0.8 kg for sitagliptin 100 mg. Table 5 Results of a 26-week Open-label Trial of Liraglutide Injection Compared to Sitagliptin (both in combination with metformin) in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Figure 4 Mean HbA 1c for Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who Completed the 26-week Trial and for the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF, intent-to-treat) data at Week 26 Combination Therapy with Metformin and Insulin This 26-week open-label trial enrolled 988 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control (HbA 1c 7-10%) on metformin (\u22651,500 mg/day) alone or inadequate glycemic control (HbA 1c 7-8.5%) on metformin (\u22651,500 mg/day) and a sulfonylurea. Patients who were on metformin and a sulfonylurea discontinued the sulfonylurea then all patients entered a 12-week run-in period during which they received add-on therapy with liraglutide injection titrated to 1.8 mg once-daily. At the end of the run-in period, 498 patients (50%) achieved HbA1c <7% with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin and continued treatment in a non-randomized, observational arm. Another 167 patients (17%) withdrew from the trial during the run-in period with approximately one-half of these patients doing so because of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The remaining 323 patients with HbA 1c \u22657% (33% of those who entered the run-in period) were randomized to 26 weeks of once-daily insulin detemir administered in the evening as add-on therapy (N=162) or to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin (N=161). The starting dose of insulin detemir was 10 units/day and the mean dose at the end of the 26-week randomized period was 39 units/day. During the 26 week randomized treatment period, the percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 11.2% in the group randomized to continued treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin and 1.2% in the group randomized to add-on therapy with insulin detemir. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 55.7% male, 91.3% White, 5.6% Black or African American and 12.5% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 34.0 kg/m2. Treatment with insulin detemir as add-on to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c and FPG compared to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin alone (Table 6). From a mean baseline body weight of 96 kg after randomization, there was a mean reduction of 0.3 kg in the patients who received insulin detemir add-on therapy compared to a mean reduction of 1.1 kg in the patients who continued on unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin alone. Table 6 Results of a 26-week Open-label Trial of Insulin detemir as add on to Liraglutide Injection + Metformin Compared to Continued Treatment with Liraglutide Injection + Metformin alone in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus not Achieving HbA 1c < 7% after 12 weeks of Metformin and Liraglutide Injection a Add-on to Sulfonylurea In this 26-week trial, 1,041 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 0.6 mg, liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, placebo, or rosiglitazone 4 mg (one-half of the maximal approved dose in the United States), all as add-on to glimepiride. Randomization occurred after a 4-week run-in period consisting of an initial, 2-week, forced-glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 2 weeks. During the titration period, doses of glimepiride were increased to 4 mg/day. The doses of glimepiride could be reduced (at the discretion of the investigator) from 4 mg/day to 3 mg/day or 2 mg/day (minimum) after randomization, in the event of unacceptable hypoglycemia or other adverse events. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 49.4% male, 64.4% White and 2.8% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 29.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride (Table 7). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.0% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 3.5% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 17.5% in the placebo + glimepiride treatment group, and 6.9% in the rosiglitazone + glimepiride treatment group. Table 7 Results of a 26-week Trial of Liraglutide Injection as add-on to Sulfonylurea in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Add-on to Metformin and Sulfonylurea In this 26-week trial, 581 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, placebo, or insulin glargine, all as add-on to metformin and glimepiride. Randomization took place after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week forced metformin and glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin and glimepiride were to be increased up to 2,000 mg/day and 4 mg/day, respectively. After randomization, patients randomized to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg underwent a 2 week period of titration with liraglutide injection. During the trial, the liraglutide injection and metformin doses were fixed, although glimepiride and insulin glargine doses could be adjusted. Patients titrated glargine twice-weekly during the first 8 weeks of treatment based on self-measured fasting plasma glucose on the day of titration. After Week 8, the frequency of insulin glargine titration was left to the discretion of the investigator, but, at a minimum, the glargine dose was to be revised, if necessary, at Weeks 12 and 18. Only 20% of glargine-treated patients achieved the pre-specified target fasting plasma glucose of \u2264100 mg/dL. Therefore, optimal titration of the insulin glargine dose was not achieved in most patients. The mean age of participants was 58 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 56.5% male, 75.0% White and 3.6% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 30.5 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection as add-on to glimepiride and metformin resulted in a statistically significant mean reduction in HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride and metformin (Table 8). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 0.9% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, 0.4% in the insulin glargine + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, and 11.3% in the placebo + metformin + glimepiride treatment group.

Maximally tolerated doses of background therapy were to remain unchanged for the duration of the trial. Patients randomized to exenatide started on a dose of 5 mcg twice-daily for 4 weeks and then were escalated to 10 mcg twice daily. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 51.9% male, 91.8% White, 5.4% Black or African American and 12.3% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG relative to exenatide (Table 9). The percentage of patients who discontinued for ineffective therapy was 0.4% in the liraglutide injection treatment group and 0% in the exenatide treatment group. Both treatment groups had a mean decrease from baseline in body weight of approximately 3 kg. Table 9 Results of a 26-week Open-label trial of Liraglutide Injection versus Exenatide (both in combination with metformin and/or sulfonylurea) in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Add-on to Metformin and Thiazolidinedione In this 26-week trial, 533 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg or placebo, all as add-on to rosiglitazone (8 mg) plus metformin (2,000 mg). Patients underwent a 9 week run-in period (3-week forced dose escalation followed by a 6-week dose maintenance phase) with rosiglitazone (starting at 4 mg and increasing to 8 mg/day within 2 weeks) and metformin (starting at 500 mg with increasing weekly increments of 500 mg to a final dose of 2,000 mg/day). Only patients who tolerated the final dose of rosiglitazone (8 mg/day) and metformin (2,000 mg/day) and completed the 6-week dose maintenance phase were eligible for randomization into the trial. The mean age of participants was 55 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 61.6% male, 84.2% White, 10.2% Black or African American and 16.4% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection as add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone produced a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA1c compared to placebo add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 10). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 1.7% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, 1.7% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, and 16.4% in the placebo + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group. Table 10 Results of a 26-week Trial of Liraglutide Injection as Add-on to Metformin and Thiazolidinedione in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a Liraglutide Injection Compared to Placebo Both With or Without metformin and/or Sulfonylurea and/or Pioglitazone and/or Basal or Premix insulin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Moderate Renal Impairment In this 26-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 279 patients with moderate renal impairment, as per MDRD formula (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2), were randomized to liraglutide injection or placebo once daily. Liraglutide injection was added to the patient\u2019s stable pre-trial antidiabetic regimen (insulin therapy and/or metformin, pioglitazone, or sulfonylurea). The dose of liraglutide injection was escalated according to approved labeling to achieve a dose of 1.8 mg per day. The insulin dose was reduced by 20% at randomization for patients with baseline HbA 1c \u2264 8% and fixed until liraglutide dose escalation was complete. Dose reduction of insulin and SU was allowed in case of hypoglycemia; up titration of insulin was allowed but not beyond the pre-trial dose. The mean age of participants was 67 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Participants were 50.5% male, 92.3% White, 6.6% Black or African American, and 7.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m2. Approximately half of patients had an eGFR between 30 and <45mL/min/1.73 m2. Treatment with liraglutide injection resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c from baseline at Week 26 compared to placebo (see Table 11). 123 patients reached the 1.8 mg dose of liraglutide injection. Table 11 Results of a 26-week Trial of Liraglutide Injection Compared to Placebo in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Moderate Renal Impairment a 14.2 Glycemic Control Trial in Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Liraglutide injection was evaluated in a 26-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo controlled multicenter trial (NCT01541215), in 134 pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 10 years and older. Patients were randomized to liraglutide injection once-daily or placebo once-daily in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin treatment. All patients were on a metformin dose of 1,000 to 2,000 mg prior to randomization. The basal insulin dose was decreased by 20% at randomization and liraglutide injection was titrated weekly by 0.6 mg for 2 to 3 weeks based on tolerability and an average fasting plasma glucose goal of \u2264110 mg/dL. The mean age was 14.6 years: 29.9% were ages 10 to 14 years, and 70.1% were greater than 14 years of age. 38.1% were male, 64.9% were White, 13.4% were Asian, 11.9% were Black or African American; 29.1% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m2 and the mean BMI SDS was 2.9. 18.7% of patients were using basal insulin at baseline. The mean duration of diabetes was 1.9 years and the mean HbA 1c was 7.8%. At week 26, treatment with liraglutide injection was superior in reducing HbA1c from baseline versus placebo. The estimated treatment difference in HbA 1c reduction from baseline between liraglutide injection and placebo was -1.06% with a 95% confidence interval of [-1.65%; -0.46%] (see Table 12).

      "Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Inform patients that liraglutide causes benign and malignant thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats and that the human relevance of this finding is unknown. Counsel patients to report symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a lump in the neck, hoarseness, dysphagia, or dyspnea) to their physician [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Pancreatitis Inform patients of the potential risk for pancreatitis. Explain that persistent severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to discontinue Liraglutide injection promptly and contact their physician if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients Advise patients that they must never share a liraglutide injection pen with another person, even if the needle is changed, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hypoglycemia Inform patients that hypoglycemia has been reported when liraglutide injection is used with insulin secretagogues or insulin and may occur in pediatric patients regardless of concomitant antidiabetic treatment. Educate patients or caregivers on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Kidney Injury Advise patients of the potential risk of dehydration due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and to take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. Inform patients of the potential risk for worsening renal function, which in some cases may require dialysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients that serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of liraglutide injection. Advise patients on the symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and instruct them to stop taking liraglutide injection and seek medical advice promptly if such symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult Patients : Initiate at 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for one week then increase to 1.2 mg daily. If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dose to 1.8 mg daily after one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg daily dose ( 2.1 ). Pediatric Patients : Initiate at 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for at least one week. If additional glycemic control is required increase the dose to 1.2 mg daily and if additional glycemic control is still required, increase the dose to 1.8 mg daily after at least one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg daily dose ( 2.1 ). Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles ( 2.3 ). Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously once-daily at any time of day, independently of meals, in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm ( 2.3 ). When using liraglutide injection with insulin, administer as separate injections. Never mix. ( 2.3 ). 2.1 Recommended Dosage Adult Patients The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide injection is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for one week. The 0.6 mg once daily dosage is intended to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] during initial titration and is not effective for glycemic control in adults. After one week at the 0.6 mg once daily dosage, increase the dosage to 1.2 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage to the maximum recommended dosage of 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily after at least one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg once daily dosage. Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide injection is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage in 0.6 mg increments after at least one week on the current dosage. The maximum recommended dosage is 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. 2.2 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose Instruct patients who miss a dose of liraglutide injection to resume the once -daily dosage regimen as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Do not administer an extra dose or increase the dose to make up for the missed dose. If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last liraglutide injection dose, reinitiate liraglutide injection at 0.6 mg once daily to mitigate any gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment. Upon reinitiation, liraglutide injection should be titrated at the discretion of the healthcare provider. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles. Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously once daily at any time of day, independently of meals. Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. No dosage adjustment is needed if changing the injection site and/or timing. Rotate injection sites within the same region in order to reduce the risk of cutaneous amyloidosis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . When using liraglutide injection with insulin, administer as separate injections. Never mix. It is acceptable to inject liraglutide injection and insulin in the same body region but the injections should not be adjacent to each other."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis : Postmarketing reports, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. Discontinue promptly if pancreatitis is suspected. Do not restart if pancreatitis is confirmed ( 5.2 ). Never share a liraglutide injection pen between patients, even if the needle is changed ( 5.3 ). Hypoglycemia: Adult patients taking an insulin secretagogue or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection regardless of insulin and/or metformin use. Reduction in the dose of insulin secretagogues or insulin may be necessary ( 5.4 ). Acute Kidney Injury : Postmarketing, usually in association with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration which may sometimes require hemodialysis. Use caution when initiating or escalating doses of liraglutide injection in patients with renal impairment ( 5.5 ). Hypersensitivity Reactions : Postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema). Discontinue liraglutide injection and promptly seek medical advice ( 5.6 ). Acute Gallbladder Disease : If cholelithiasis or cholecystitis are suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated ( 5.7 ). Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation : Has been reported in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers of any planned surgeries or procedures (5.8). 5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether liraglutide injection will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and liraglutide injection use in humans. Liraglutide injection is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of liraglutide injection and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated. 5.2 Pancreatitis Based on spontaneous postmarketing reports, acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with liraglutide injection. After initiation of liraglutide injection, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, liraglutide injection should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, liraglutide injection should not be restarted. In glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there have been 13 cases of pancreatitis among liraglutide injection-treated patients and 1 case in a comparator (glimepiride) treated patient (2.7 vs. 0.5 cases per 1,000 patient-years). Nine of the 13 cases with liraglutide injection were reported as acute pancreatitis and four were reported as chronic pancreatitis. In one case in a liraglutide injection-treated patient, pancreatitis, with necrosis, was observed and led to death; however clinical causality could not be established. Some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse. Liraglutide injection has been studied in a limited number of patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown if patients with a history of pancreatitis are at higher risk for development of pancreatitis on liraglutide injection. 5.3 Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients Liraglutide injection pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Adult patients receiving liraglutide injection in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection regardless of insulin and/or metformin use. [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications and pediatric patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.5 Acute Kidney Injury Liraglutide injection has not been found to be directly nephrotoxic in animal studies or clinical trials. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis in liraglutide injection-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Some of the reported events occurred in patients receiving one or more medications known to affect renal function or hydration status. Altered renal function has been reversed in many of the reported cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including liraglutide injection. Use caution when initiating or escalating doses of liraglutide injection in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with liraglutide injection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue liraglutide injection; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with liraglutide injection. Liraglutide injection is contraindicated in patients who have had a serious hypersensitivity reaction to liraglutide or any of the excipients in liraglutide injection [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.7 Acute Gallbladder Disease Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.8 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation Liraglutide injection delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations. Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking liraglutide injection, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing liraglutide injection could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking liraglutide injection."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information: Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Acute Kidney Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Acute Gallbladder Disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655%) in clinical trials are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, dyspepsia, constipation ( 6.1 ). Immunogenicity-related events, including urticaria, were more common among liraglutide injection-treated patients (0.8%) than among comparator-treated patients (0.4%) in clinical trials ( 12.6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-845-0689 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Common Adverse Reactions The safety of liraglutide injection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled trials in adults and one trial of 52 weeks duration in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . The data in Table 1 reflect exposure of 1,673 adult patients to liraglutide injection and a mean duration of exposure to liraglutide injection of 37.3 weeks. The mean age of adult patients was 58 years, 4% were 75 years or older and 54% were male. The population was 79% White, 6% Black or African American, 13% Asian; 4% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years and a mean HbA 1c of 8.4%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% and moderately impaired in 12% of the pooled population. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions in adults, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of liraglutide injection for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on liraglutide injection than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with liraglutide injection. Overall, the type, and severity of adverse reactions in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older and above were comparable to that observed in the adult population.

In an analysis of placebo- and active-controlled trials, the types and frequency of common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, were similar to those listed in Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions In the pool of 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled adult clinical trials, withdrawals due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions, occurred in 4.3% of liraglutide injection-treated patients and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Withdrawal due to gastrointestinal adverse events mainly occurred during the first 2 to 3 months of the trials. Injection site reactions Injection site reactions (e.g., injection site rash, erythema) were reported in approximately 2% of liraglutide injection-treated adult patients in the five double-blind, glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration. Less than 0.2% of liraglutide injection-treated patients discontinued due to injection site reactions. Hypoglycemia In 5 adult glycemic control, placebo-controlled clinical trials of at least 26 weeks duration, hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person for treatment occurred in 8 liraglutide injection-treated patients (7.5 events per 1,000 patient-years). Of these 8 liraglutide injection-treated patients, 7 patients were concomitantly using a sulfonylurea.

In a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with a 26-week open-label extension, 21.2% of liraglutide injection-treated patients (mean age 14.6 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus, had hypoglycemia with a blood glucose <54 mg/dL with or without symptoms (335 events per 1,000 patient years). No severe hypoglycemic episodes occurred in the liraglutide injection treatment group (severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions). Papillary thyroid carcinoma In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there were 7 reported cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma in patients treated with liraglutide injection and 1 case in a comparator-treated patient (1.5 vs. 0.5 cases per 1,000 patient-years). Most of these papillary thyroid carcinomas were <1 cm in greatest diameter and were diagnosed in surgical pathology specimens after thyroidectomy prompted by findings on protocol-specified screening with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, the incidence of cholelithiasis was 0.3% in both liraglutide injection-treated and placebo-treated patients. The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.2% in both liraglutide injection-treated and placebo-treated patients. Laboratory Tests Bilirubin In the five adult glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration, mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (elevations to no more than twice the upper limit of the reference range) occurred in 4.0% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 2.1% of placebo-treated patients and 3.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. This finding was not accompanied by abnormalities in other liver tests. The significance of this isolated finding is unknown. Calcitonin Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program. At the end of the adult glycemic control trials, adjusted mean serum calcitonin concentrations were higher in liraglutide injection-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients but not compared to patients receiving active comparator. Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less. Among adult patients with pretreatment calcitonin <20 ng/L, calcitonin elevations to >20 ng/L occurred in 0.7% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, and 0.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Lipase and Amylase In one adult glycemic control trial in renal impairment patients, a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed for liraglutide injection-treated patients while placebo-treated patients had a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with liraglutide injection is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Vital signs Liraglutide injection did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed in adult patients treated with liraglutide injection compared to placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of liraglutide injection. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal: Acute pancreatitis, hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis sometimes resulting in death, ileus General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Allergic reactions: rash and pruritus Hepatobiliary: Elevations of liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy, hepatitis Immune system: Angioedema and anaphylactic reactions Metabolism and nutrition: Dehydration resulting from nausea, vomiting and diarrhea Neoplasms: Medullary thyroid carcinoma Nervous system: Dysgeusia, dizziness Pulmonary : Pulmonary aspiration has occurred in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation. Renal and urinary: Increased serum creatinine, acute renal failure or worsening of chronic renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis Skin and subcutaneous tissue: Cutaneous amyloidosis"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Effects of delayed gastric emptying on oral medications: Liraglutide injection delays gastric emptying and may impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications ( 7 ). 7.1 Effects of Delayed Gastric Emptying on Oral Medications Liraglutide injection causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials, liraglutide injection did not affect the absorption of the tested orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with liraglutide injection. 7.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin Liraglutide injection stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. Patients receiving liraglutide injection in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. When initiating liraglutide injection, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Liraglutide injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus ( 8.1 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to liraglutide injection during pregnancy. Liraglutide injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal reproduction studies identified increased adverse developmental outcomes from exposure during pregnancy. Liraglutide exposure was associated with early embryonic deaths and an imbalance in some fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats administered liraglutide during organogenesis at doses that approximate clinical exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.8 mg/day. In pregnant rabbits administered liraglutide during organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of major fetal abnormalities were seen at exposures below the human exposures at the MRHD [see Animal Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects for women with uncontrolled pre-gestational diabetes (Hemoglobin A 1C >7) is 6 to 10%. The major birth defect rate has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a Hemoglobin A 1C >10. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Animal Data Female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide beginning 2 weeks before mating through gestation day 17 had estimated systemic exposures 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times the human exposure at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. The number of early embryonic deaths in the 1 mg/kg/day group increased slightly. Fetal abnormalities and variations in kidneys and blood vessels, irregular ossification of the skull, and a more complete state of ossification occurred at all doses. Mottled liver and minimally kinked ribs occurred at the highest dose. The incidence of fetal malformations in liraglutide-treated groups exceeding concurrent and historical controls were misshapen oropharynx and/or narrowed opening into larynx at 0.1 mg/kg/day and umbilical hernia at 0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg/day. Pregnant rabbits given subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through day 18 inclusive, had estimated systemic exposures less than the human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day at all doses, based on plasma AUC. Liraglutide decreased fetal weight and dose-dependently increased the incidence of total major fetal abnormalities at all doses. The incidence of malformations exceeded concurrent and historical controls at 0.01 mg/kg/day (kidneys, scapula), \u2265 0.01 mg/kg/day (eyes, forelimb), 0.025 mg/kg/day (brain, tail and sacral vertebrae, major blood vessels and heart, umbilicus), \u2265 0.025 mg/kg/day (sternum) and at 0.05 mg/kg/day (parietal bones, major blood vessels). Irregular ossification and/or skeletal abnormalities occurred in the skull and jaw, vertebrae and ribs, sternum, pelvis, tail, and scapula; and dose-dependent minor skeletal variations were observed. Visceral abnormalities occurred in blood vessels, lung, liver, and esophagus. Bilobed or bifurcated gallbladder was seen in all treatment groups, but not in the control group. In pregnant female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through weaning or termination of nursing on lactation day 24, estimated systemic exposures were 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day, based on plasma AUC. A slight delay in parturition was observed in the majority of treated rats. Group mean body weight of neonatal rats from liraglutide-treated dams was lower than neonatal rats from control group dams. Bloody scabs and agitated behavior occurred in male rats descended from dams treated with 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide. Group mean body weight from birth to postpartum day 14 trended lower in F 2 generation rats descended from liraglutide-treated rats compared to F 2 generation rats descended from controls, but differences did not reach statistical significance for any group. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of liraglutide injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Liraglutide was present in milk of lactating rats [see Data] . Developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for liraglutide injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liraglutide injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In lactating rats, liraglutide was present unchanged in milk at concentrations approximately 50% of maternal plasma concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide injection as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older. Use of liraglutide injection for this indication is supported by a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial and a 26-week open-label extension in 134 pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a pediatric pharmacokinetic study, and studies in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.2 )] . The risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection in pediatric patients regardless of insulin and/or metformin use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide injection have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the liraglutide injection treatment arms of the glycemic control trials, a total of 832 (19.3%) of the patients were 65 to 74 years of age and 145 (3.4%) were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . No overall differences in safety or effectiveness for liraglutide injection have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of liraglutide injection is recommended for patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The safety and efficacy of liraglutide injection was evaluated in a 26-week clinical study that included patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. There is limited experience with liraglutide injection in patients with end stage renal disease. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Use caution in patients who experience dehydration. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There is limited experience in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, liraglutide injection should be used with caution in this patient population. No dose adjustment of liraglutide injection is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.8 Gastroparesis Liraglutide injection slows gastric emptying. Liraglutide injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing gastroparesis."

The incidence of malformations exceeded concurrent and historical controls at 0.01 mg/kg/day (kidneys, scapula), \u2265 0.01 mg/kg/day (eyes, forelimb), 0.025 mg/kg/day (brain, tail and sacral vertebrae, major blood vessels and heart, umbilicus), \u2265 0.025 mg/kg/day (sternum) and at 0.05 mg/kg/day (parietal bones, major blood vessels). Irregular ossification and/or skeletal abnormalities occurred in the skull and jaw, vertebrae and ribs, sternum, pelvis, tail, and scapula; and dose-dependent minor skeletal variations were observed. Visceral abnormalities occurred in blood vessels, lung, liver, and esophagus. Bilobed or bifurcated gallbladder was seen in all treatment groups, but not in the control group. In pregnant female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through weaning or termination of nursing on lactation day 24, estimated systemic exposures were 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day, based on plasma AUC. A slight delay in parturition was observed in the majority of treated rats. Group mean body weight of neonatal rats from liraglutide-treated dams was lower than neonatal rats from control group dams. Bloody scabs and agitated behavior occurred in male rats descended from dams treated with 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide. Group mean body weight from birth to postpartum day 14 trended lower in F 2 generation rats descended from liraglutide-treated rats compared to F 2 generation rats descended from controls, but differences did not reach statistical significance for any group."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Liraglutide Injection contains liraglutide, an analog of human GLP-1 and acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Liraglutide Injection contains chemically synthesized Liraglutide that has been engineered to be 97% homologous to native human GLP-1 by substituting arginine for lysine at position 34. Liraglutide is made by attaching a C-16 fatty acid (palmitic acid) with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26 of the peptide precursor. The molecular formula of liraglutide is C 172 H 265 N 43 O 51 and the molecular weight is 3751.2 Daltons. The structural formula (Figure 1) is: Figure 1 Structural Formula of liraglutide Liraglutide Injection is a sterile, aqueous, clear, colorless or almost colorless solution for subcutaneous use. Each 1 mL of Liraglutide Injection solution contains 6 mg of liraglutide and the following inactive ingredients: disodium phosphate dihydrate, 1.42 mg; propylene glycol, 14 mg; phenol, 5.5 mg; and water for injection. Liraglutide Injection has a pH of approximately 8.15, hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH. Each pre-filled pen contains a 3 mL solution of Liraglutide Injection equivalent to 18 mg liraglutide (free-base, anhydrous). Figure 1 Structural Formula of liraglutide"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Liraglutide is an acylated human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37). GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-IV and NEP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide injection\u2019s pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide injection lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide injection or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide injection 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) liraglutide injection on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner (Figure 2). Figure 2 Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide Injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide injection lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single dose of liraglutide injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide injection causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide injection on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide injection at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. Figure 2 Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide Injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to 12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide injection, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide injection is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide injection using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide injection in the pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide injection compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide injection provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5 to 6) to severe (Child Pugh score > 9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Drug Interactions Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide injection has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide injection (8 to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The co-administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with Liraglutide Injection. Atorvastatin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide injection. Acetaminophen Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1,000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide injection at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Liraglutide injection lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide injection on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide injection increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide injection delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide injection and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those with liraglutide injection or other liraglutide products. A subset of liraglutide injection-treated patients (1,104 of 2,501, 44%) in five adult double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] and 102/1,104 (9%) of liraglutide injection-treated patients developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Of these 102 liraglutide injection-treated patients, 56 (5%) patients developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 12 (1%) of the liraglutide injection-treated patients. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-liraglutide antibodies on effectiveness of liraglutide injection. In five double-blind adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of liraglutide injection-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for liraglutide injection-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. In a clinical trial with pediatric patients aged 10 years and older [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )], anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 1 (2%) liraglutide injection-treated patient at week 26 and 5 (9%) liraglutide injection-treated patients at week 53. None of the 5 patients had antibodies cross reactive to native GLP-1 or had neutralizing antibodies."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to 12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide injection, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide injection is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] .

Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide injection provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment.

Drug Interactions Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide injection has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide injection (8 to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The co-administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with Liraglutide Injection. Atorvastatin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide injection. Acetaminophen Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1,000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide injection at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Liraglutide injection lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide injection on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide injection increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide injection delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide injection and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female CD-1 mice at doses of 0.03, 0.2, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection yielding systemic exposures 0.2-, 2-, 10- and 45-times the human exposure, respectively, at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day based on plasma AUC comparison. A dose-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in the 1.0 and the 3.0 mg/kg/day groups with incidences of 13% and 19% in males and 6% and 20% in females, respectively. C-cell adenomas did not occur in control groups or 0.03 and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. Treatment-related malignant C-cell carcinomas occurred in 3% of females in the 3.0 mg/kg/day group. Thyroid C-cell tumors are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in mice. A treatment-related increase in fibrosarcomas was seen on the dorsal skin and subcutis, the body surface used for drug injection, in males in the 3 mg/kg/day group. These fibrosarcomas were attributed to the high local concentration of drug near the injection site. The liraglutide concentration in the clinical formulation (6 mg/mL) is 10-times higher than the concentration in the formulation used to administer 3 mg/kg/day liraglutide to mice in the carcinogenicity study (0.6 mg/mL). A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0.075, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection with exposures 0.5-, 2- and 8-times the human exposure, respectively, resulting from the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. A treatment-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in males in 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide groups with incidences of 12%, 16%, 42%, and 46% and in all female liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 10%, 27%, 33%, and 56% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. A treatment-related increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in all male liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 2%, 8%, 6%, and 14% and in females at 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day with incidences of 0%, 0%, 4%, and 6% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. Thyroid C-cell carcinomas are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in rats. Studies in mice demonstrated that liraglutide-induced C-cell proliferation was dependent on the GLP-1 receptor and that liraglutide did not cause activation of the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene in thyroid C-cells. Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats is unknown and has not been determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Liraglutide was negative with and without metabolic activation in the Ames test for mutagenicity and in a human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test for clastogenicity. Liraglutide was negative in repeat-dose in vivo micronucleus tests in rats. In rat fertility studies using subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating until gestation day 17. No direct adverse effects on male fertility was observed at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day, a high dose yielding an estimated systemic exposure 11- times the human exposure at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC. In female rats, an increase in early embryonic deaths occurred at 1.0 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain and food consumption were observed in females at the 1.0 mg/kg/day dose."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female CD-1 mice at doses of 0.03, 0.2, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection yielding systemic exposures 0.2-, 2-, 10- and 45-times the human exposure, respectively, at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day based on plasma AUC comparison. A dose-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in the 1.0 and the 3.0 mg/kg/day groups with incidences of 13% and 19% in males and 6% and 20% in females, respectively. C-cell adenomas did not occur in control groups or 0.03 and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. Treatment-related malignant C-cell carcinomas occurred in 3% of females in the 3.0 mg/kg/day group. Thyroid C-cell tumors are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in mice. A treatment-related increase in fibrosarcomas was seen on the dorsal skin and subcutis, the body surface used for drug injection, in males in the 3 mg/kg/day group. These fibrosarcomas were attributed to the high local concentration of drug near the injection site. The liraglutide concentration in the clinical formulation (6 mg/mL) is 10-times higher than the concentration in the formulation used to administer 3 mg/kg/day liraglutide to mice in the carcinogenicity study (0.6 mg/mL). A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0.075, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection with exposures 0.5-, 2- and 8-times the human exposure, respectively, resulting from the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In glycemic control trials in adults, liraglutide injection has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with one or two oral anti-diabetic medications or basal insulin. In each of the placebo controlled trials, treatment with liraglutide injection produced clinically and statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A 1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo. All liraglutide injection-treated patients started at 0.6 mg/day. The dose was increased in weekly intervals by 0.6 mg to reach 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg for patients randomized to these higher doses. Liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is not effective for glycemic control and is intended only as a starting dose to reduce gastrointestinal intolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Monotherapy In this 52-week trial, 746 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, or glimepiride 8 mg. Patients who were randomized to glimepiride were initially treated with 2 mg daily for two weeks, increasing to 4 mg daily for another two weeks, and finally increasing to 8 mg daily. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and 1.2 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c compared to glimepiride (Table 3). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.6% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg treatment group, 6.0% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg treatment group, and 10.1% in the glimepiride-treatment group. The mean age of participants was 53 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 5 years. Participants were 49.7% male, 77.5% White, 12.6% Black or African American and 35.0% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.1 kg/m 2 .

Randomization occurred after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week initial forced metformin titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin were increased up to 2,000 mg/day. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to metformin resulted in a significant mean HbA 1c reduction relative to placebo add-on to metformin and resulted in a similar mean HbA 1c reduction relative to glimepiride 4 mg add-on to metformin (Table 4). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 5.4% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin treatment group, 3.3% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + metformin treatment group, 23.8% in the placebo + metformin treatment group, and 3.7% in the glimepiride + metformin treated group. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 7 years. Participants were 58.2% male, 87.1% White and 2.4% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 31.0 kg/m 2 .

Patients were to continue their current treatment on metformin at a stable, pre-trial dose level and dosing frequency. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 6 years. Participants were 52.9% male, 86.6% White, 7.2% Black or African American and 16.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.8 kg/m 2 . The primary endpoint was the change in HbA 1c from baseline to Week 26. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c relative to sitagliptin 100 mg (Table 5). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.1% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg group, 0.5% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg treatment group, and 4.1% in the sitagliptin 100 mg treatment group. From a mean baseline body weight of 94 kg, there was a mean reduction of 2.7 kg for liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, 3.3 kg for liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, and 0.8 kg for sitagliptin 100 mg.

Patients who were on metformin and a sulfonylurea discontinued the sulfonylurea then all patients entered a 12-week run-in period during which they received add-on therapy with liraglutide injection titrated to 1.8 mg once-daily. At the end of the run-in period, 498 patients (50%) achieved HbA 1c <7% with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin and continued treatment in a non-randomized, observational arm. Another 167 patients (17%) withdrew from the trial during the run-in period with approximately one-half of these patients doing so because of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The remaining 323 patients with HbA 1c \u22657% (33% of those who entered the run-in period) were randomized to 26 weeks of once-daily insulin detemir administered in the evening as add-on therapy (N=162) or to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin (N=161). The starting dose of insulin detemir was 10 units/day and the mean dose at the end of the 26-week randomized period was 39 units/day. During the 26 week randomized treatment period, the percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 11.2% in the group randomized to continued treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin and 1.2% in the group randomized to add-on therapy with insulin detemir. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 55.7% male, 91.3% White, 5.6% Black or African American and 12.5% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 34.0 kg/m 2 . Treatment with insulin detemir as add-on to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG compared to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin alone (Table 6). From a mean baseline body weight of 96 kg after randomization, there was a mean reduction of 0.3 kg in the patients who received insulin detemir add-on therapy compared to a mean reduction of 1.1 kg in the patients who continued on unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin alone.

Randomization occurred after a 4-week run-in period consisting of an initial, 2-week, forced-glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 2 weeks. During the titration period, doses of glimepiride were increased to 4 mg/day. The doses of glimepiride could be reduced (at the discretion of the investigator) from 4 mg/day to 3 mg/day or 2 mg/day (minimum) after randomization, in the event of unacceptable hypoglycemia or other adverse events. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 49.4% male, 64.4% White and 2.8% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 29.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride (Table 7). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.0% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 3.5% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 17.5% in the placebo + glimepiride treatment group, and 6.9% in the rosiglitazone + glimepiride treatment group.

Randomization took place after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week forced metformin and glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin and glimepiride were to be increased up to 2,000 mg/day and 4 mg/day, respectively. After randomization, patients randomized to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg underwent a 2 week period of titration with liraglutide injection. During the trial, the liraglutide injection and metformin doses were fixed, although glimepiride and insulin glargine doses could be adjusted. Patients titrated glargine twice-weekly during the first 8 weeks of treatment based on self-measured fasting plasma glucose on the day of titration. After Week 8, the frequency of insulin glargine titration was left to the discretion of the investigator, but, at a minimum, the glargine dose was to be revised, if necessary, at Weeks 12 and 18. Only 20% of glargine-treated patients achieved the pre-specified target fasting plasma glucose of \u2264100 mg/dL. Therefore, optimal titration of the insulin glargine dose was not achieved in most patients. The mean age of participants was 58 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 56.5% male, 75.0% White and 3.6% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 30.5 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection as add-on to glimepiride and metformin resulted in a statistically significant mean reduction in HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride and metformin (Table 8). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 0.9% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, 0.4% in the insulin glargine + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, and 11.3% in the placebo + metformin + glimepiride treatment group.

Maximally tolerated doses of background therapy were to remain unchanged for the duration of the trial. Patients randomized to exenatide started on a dose of 5 mcg twice-daily for 4 weeks and then were escalated to 10 mcg twice daily. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 51.9% male, 91.8% White, 5.4% Black or African American and 12.3% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG relative to exenatide (Table 9). The percentage of patients who discontinued for ineffective therapy was 0.4% in the liraglutide injection treatment group and 0% in the exenatide treatment group. Both treatment groups had a mean decrease from baseline in body weight of approximately 3 kg.

Patients underwent a 9 week run-in period (3-week forced dose escalation followed by a 6-week dose maintenance phase) with rosiglitazone (starting at 4 mg and increasing to 8 mg/day within 2 weeks) and metformin (starting at 500 mg with increasing weekly increments of 500 mg to a final dose of 2,000 mg/day). Only patients who tolerated the final dose of rosiglitazone (8 mg/day) and metformin (2,000 mg/day) and completed the 6-week dose maintenance phase were eligible for randomization into the trial. The mean age of participants was 55 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 61.6% male, 84.2% White, 10.2% Black or African American and 16.4% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection as add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone produced a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 10). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 1.7% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, 1.7% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, and 16.4% in the placebo + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group.

Liraglutide injection was added to the patient's stable pre-trial antidiabetic regimen (insulin therapy and/or metformin, pioglitazone, or sulfonylurea). The dose of liraglutide injection was escalated according to approved labeling to achieve a dose of 1.8 mg per day. The insulin dose was reduced by 20% at randomization for patients with baseline HbA 1c \u2264 8% and fixed until liraglutide dose escalation was complete. Dose reduction of insulin and SU was allowed in case of hypoglycemia; up titration of insulin was allowed but not beyond the pre-trial dose. The mean age of participants was 67 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Participants were 50.5% male, 92.3% White, 6.6% Black or African American, and 7.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 . Approximately half of patients had an eGFR between 30 and <45mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c from baseline at Week 26 compared to placebo (see Table 11). 123 patients reached the 1.8 mg dose of liraglutide injection.

Patients were randomized to liraglutide injection once-daily or placebo once-daily in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin treatment. All patients were on a metformin dose of 1,000 to 2,000 mg prior to randomization. The basal insulin dose was decreased by 20% at randomization and liraglutide injection was titrated weekly by 0.6 mg for 2 to 3 weeks based on tolerability and an average fasting plasma glucose goal of \u2264110 mg/dL. The mean age was 14.6 years: 29.9% were ages 10 to 14 years, and 70.1% were greater than 14 years of age. 38.1% were male, 64.9% were White, 13.4% were Asian, 11.9% were Black or African American; 29.1% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 and the mean BMI SDS was 2.9. 18.7% of patients were using basal insulin at baseline. The mean duration of diabetes was 1.9 years and the mean HbA 1c was 7.8%. At week 26, treatment with liraglutide injection was superior in reducing HbA 1c from baseline versus placebo. The estimated treatment difference in HbA 1c reduction from baseline between liraglutide injection and placebo was -1.06% with a 95% confidence interval of [-1.65%; -0.46%] (see Table 12).

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Inform patients that liraglutide causes benign and malignant thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats and that the human relevance of this finding is unknown. Counsel patients to report symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a lump in the neck, hoarseness, dysphagia, or dyspnea) to their physician [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Pancreatitis Inform patients of the potential risk for pancreatitis. Explain that persistent severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to discontinue liraglutide injection promptly and contact their physician if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients Advise patients that they must never share a liraglutide injection pen with another person, even if the needle is changed, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypoglycemia Inform patients that hypoglycemia has been reported when liraglutide injection is used with insulin secretagogues or insulin and may occur in pediatric patients regardless of concomitant antidiabetic treatment. Educate patients or caregivers on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Acute Kidney Injury Advise patients of the potential risk of dehydration due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and to take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. Inform patients of the potential risk for worsening renal function, which in some cases may require dialysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients that serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of liraglutide injection. Advise patients on the symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and instruct them to stop taking liraglutide injection and seek medical advice promptly if such symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Acute Gallbladder Disease Inform patients of the potential risk for cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. Instruct patients to contact their physician if cholelithiasis or cholecystitis is suspected for appropriate clinical follow-up [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation Inform patients that liraglutide injection may cause their stomach to empty more slowly which may lead to complications with anesthesia or deep sedation during planned surgeries or procedures. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking liraglutide injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Missed Dose Inform patients not to take an extra dose of liraglutide injection to make up for a missed dose. If a dose is missed, the once-daily regimen should be resumed as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last dose, advise the patient to reinitiate liraglutide injection at 0.6 mg to mitigate any gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment. Liraglutide injection should be titrated at the discretion of the healthcare provider [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Manufactured by: Hybio Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

Do not share your liraglutide injection pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. Your liraglutide injection pen is a disposable single-patient-use prefilled pen injector that contains 3 mL of liraglutide injection and will deliver doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg.

Talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist for more information about needles for your liraglutide injection pen. Important Information \u0394 Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \u0394 Always remove the needle after each injection, and store your pen without the needle attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of liraglutide, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. \u0394 Keep your liraglutide injection pen and all medicines out of the reach of children. \u0394 If you drop your liraglutide injection pen, repeat \u201cFirst Time Use For Each New Pen\u201d (steps A through D). \u0394 Be careful not to bend or damage the needle. \u0394 Do not use the cartridge scale to measure how much liraglutide injection to inject. \u0394 Be careful when handling used needles to avoid needle stick injuries. \u0394 You can use your liraglutide injection pen for up to 30 days after you use it the first time. First Time Use for Each New Pen Step A. Check the Pen Take your new liraglutide injection pen out of the refrigerator. Wash hands with soap and water before use. Check pen label before each use to make sure it is your liraglutide injection pen. Pull off pen cap (See Figure A). Check liraglutide injection in the cartridge. The liquid should be clear, colorless and free of particles. If not, do not use. Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab. Figure A Step B. Attach the Needle Remove protective tab from outer needle cap (See Figure B). Push outer needle cap containing the needle straight onto the pen, then screw needle on until secure. Figure B Pull off outer needle cap (See Figure C). Do not throw away Pull off inner needle cap and throw away (See Figure D). A small drop of liquid may appear. This is normal. Figure C Figure D Step C. Dial to the Flow Check Symbol This step is done only Once for each new pen and is Only required the first time you use a new pen. Turn dose selector until the black line of flow check symbol ( Flow check symbol ) lines up with pointer (See Figure E). The flow check symbol does not administer the dose as prescribed by your healthcare provider. To select the dose prescribed by your healthcare provider, continue to Step G under \u201cRoutine Use\u201d. Step D. Prepare the Pen Hold pen with needle pointing up. Tap cartridge gently with your finger a few times to bring any air bubbles to the top of the cartridge (See Figure F). Figure F Keep needle pointing up and press dose button until the black line of 0 mg lines up with pointer (See Figure G). Repeat steps C and D, up to 6 times, until a drop of Liraglutide Injection appears at the needle tip.

Store your liraglutide injection pen at 59\u00baF to 86\u00baF (15\u00baC to 30\u00baC), or in a refrigerator at 36\u00baF to 46\u00baF (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). When carrying the pen away from home, store the pen at a temperature between 59\u00baF to 86\u00baF (15\u00baC to 30\u00baC). If liraglutide injection has been exposed to temperatures above 86\u00baF (30\u00b0C), it should be thrown away. Protect your liraglutide injection pen from heat and sunlight.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm once daily at any time of day, without regard to the timing of meals. ( 2.1 ) The recommended dose of liraglutide injection is 3 mg daily. ( 2.2 ) Initiate at 0.6 mg per day for one week. In weekly intervals, increase the dose until a dose of 3 mg is reached. ( 2.2 ) If pediatric patients do not tolerate an increased dose during dose escalation, the dose may also be lowered to the previous level. Dose escalation for pediatric patients may take up to 8 weeks. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric patients who do not tolerate 3 mg daily may have their dose reduced to 2.4 mg daily. ( 2.2 ) Adult patients with type 2 diabetes should monitor blood glucose prior to starting liraglutide injection and during liraglutide injection treatment. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Prior to initiation of liraglutide injection, train patients on proper injection technique. Refer to the accompanying Instructions for Use for complete administration instructions with illustrations. Inspect liraglutide injection visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles. Administer liraglutide injection in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously once daily at any time of day, without regard to the timing of meals. Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. No dosage adjustment is needed if changing the injection site and/or timing. Rotate injection sites within the same region in order to reduce the risk of cutaneous amyloidosis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . If a dose is missed, resume the once-daily regimen as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Do not administer an extra dose or increase the dose to make up for the missed dose. If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last liraglutide injection dosage, reinitiate liraglutide injection at 0.6 mg daily and follow the dosage escalation schedule in Table 3, to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with reinitiation of treatment. 2.2 Dosage in Adults and Pediatric Patients Aged 12 Years and Older Initiate liraglutide injection with a dose of 0.6 mg daily for one week. Then follow the dosage escalation schedule in Table 3 to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Table 3: Dosage Escalation Schedule Week Daily Dose 1 0.6 mg 2 1.2 mg 3 1.8 mg 4 2.4 mg 5 and onward 3 mg Adult Patients For adults, the recommended dosage of liraglutide injection is 3 mg daily, lower dosages are for titration only. Discontinue liraglutide injection if the patient cannot tolerate the 3 mg dosage. If patients do not tolerate an increased dose during dosage escalation, consider delaying dosage escalation for approximately one additional week. Evaluate the change in body weight 16 weeks after initiating liraglutide injection and discontinue liraglutide injection if the patient has not lost at least 4% of baseline body weight, since it is unlikely that the patient will achieve and sustain clinically meaningful weight loss with continued treatment. In adult patients with type 2 diabetes, monitor blood glucose prior to starting liraglutide injection and during liraglutide injection treatment. Pediatric Patients For pediatric patients, the recommended maintenance dosage of liraglutide injection is 3 mg daily. Pediatric patients who do not tolerate 3 mg daily may have their maintenance dose reduced to 2.4 mg daily. Discontinue liraglutide injection if the patient cannot tolerate the 2.4 mg dose. If pediatric patients do not tolerate an increased dose during dosage escalation, the dose may also be lowered to the previous level. Dosage escalation for pediatric patients may take up to 8 weeks. Evaluate the change in BMI after 12 weeks on the maintenance dose and discontinue liraglutide injection if the patient has not had a reduction in BMI of at least 1% from baseline, since it is unlikely that the patient will achieve and sustain clinically meaningful weight loss with continued treatment."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Pancreatitis: Has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide. Discontinue if pancreatitis is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Acute Gallbladder Disease: If cholelithiasis or cholecystitis are suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia: Can occur in adults when liraglutide is used with an insulin secretagogue (e.g. a sulfonylurea) or insulin. The risk may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues or insulin. In the pediatric clinical trial, patients did not have type 2 diabetes. Hypoglycemia occurred in liraglutide-treated pediatric patients. Inform all patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. ( 5.4 ) Heart Rate Increase: Monitor heart rate at regular intervals. ( 5.5 ) Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion: Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions that could lead to volume depletion. ( 5.6 ) Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe. Liraglutide is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis. ( 5.7 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema). Discontinue liraglutide and other suspect medications and promptly seek medical advice. ( 5.8 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor for depression or suicidal thoughts. Discontinue liraglutide if symptoms develop. ( 5.9 ) Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation: Has been reported in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers of any planned surgeries or procedures. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether liraglutide will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and liraglutide use in humans. Liraglutide is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of liraglutide and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC, and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values greater than 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated. 5.2 Acute Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . After initiation of liraglutide, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue liraglutide injection and initiate appropriate management. 5.3 Acute Gallbladder Disease In liraglutide clinical trials in adults, 2.2% of liraglutide-treated patients reported adverse events of cholelithiasis versus 0.8% of placebo-treated patients. The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.8% in liraglutide-treated patients versus 0.4% in placebo-treated patients. The majority of liraglutide-treated patients with adverse events of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis required cholecystectomy. Substantial or rapid weight loss can increase the risk of cholelithiasis; however, the incidence of acute gallbladder disease was greater in liraglutide-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients even after accounting for the degree of weight loss. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia with use of liraglutide, including severe hypoglycemia. In patients with type 2 diabetes, monitor blood glucose prior to starting liraglutide and during liraglutide treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. In the pediatric clinical trial, patients did not have type 2 diabetes but were provided with blood glucose meters. Clinically significant hypoglycemia, defined as blood glucose <54 mg/dL, occurred in 1.6% of the liraglutide-treated patients compared to 0.8% of placebo-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Inform all pediatric patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.5 Heart Rate Increase Mean increases in resting heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute (bpm) were observed with routine clinical monitoring in liraglutide-treated adult patients compared to placebo in clinical trials. More patients treated with liraglutide, compared with placebo, had changes from baseline at two consecutive visits of more than 10 bpm (34% versus 19%, respectively) and 20 bpm (5% versus 2%, respectively). At least one resting heart rate exceeding 100 bpm was recorded for 6% of liraglutide-treated patients compared with 4% of placebo-treated patients, with this occurring at two consecutive study visits for 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively. Tachycardia was reported as an adverse reaction in 0.6% of liraglutide-treated patients and in 0.1% of placebo-treated patients. In a clinical pharmacology trial that monitored heart rate continuously for 24 hours, liraglutide treatment was associated with a heart rate that was 4 to 9 bpm higher than that observed with placebo. In a pediatric clinical trial, mean increases from baseline in resting heart rate of 3 to 7 bpm were observed with liraglutide treatment. Heart rate should be monitored at regular intervals consistent with usual clinical practice. Patients should inform health care providers of palpitations or feelings of a racing heartbeat while at rest during liraglutide treatment. For patients who experience a sustained increase in resting heart rate while taking liraglutide, liraglutide should be discontinued. 5.6 Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, in some cases requiring hemodialysis, in patients treated with liraglutide [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . The majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced gastrointestinal reactions leading to dehydration such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions to liraglutide that could lead to volume depletion, especially during dosage initiation and escalation [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.7 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide, has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . In liraglutide clinical trials, severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among patients receiving liraglutide (4.8%) than placebo (1.4 %). Liraglutide is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with liraglutide [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the patient should discontinue liraglutide injection and other suspect medications and promptly seek medical advice. Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with liraglutide. 5.9 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation In liraglutide adult clinical trials, 9 (0.3%) of 3,384 liraglutide-treated patients and 2 (0.1%) of the 1,941 placebo-treated patients reported suicidal ideation; one of these liraglutide-treated patients attempted suicide. In a liraglutide pediatric clinical trial, 1 (0.8%) of the 125 liraglutide-treated patients died by suicide. There was insufficient information to establish a causal relationship to liraglutide. Patients treated with liraglutide should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Discontinue liraglutide in patients who experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Avoid liraglutide in patients with a history of suicidal attempts or active suicidal ideation. 5.10 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation Liraglutide delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations. Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking liraglutide, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing liraglutide could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking liraglutide."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Liraglutide was evaluated for safety in 5 double-blind, placebo controlled trials that included 3,384 overweight or obese adult patients treated with liraglutide for a treatment period up to 56 weeks (3 trials), 52 weeks (1 trial), and 32 weeks (1 trial) and one trial of 56 weeks in 125 pediatric patients with obesity aged 12 years and older [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.2 )]. All patients received study drug in addition to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity counseling. In the adult trials, patients received liraglutide for a mean treatment duration of 46 weeks (median, 56 weeks). Baseline characteristics included a mean age of 47 years, 71% female, 85% white, 39% with hypertension, 15% with type 2 diabetes, 34% with dyslipidemia, 29% with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m 2 , and 9% with cardiovascular disease. In one of the 56-week trials, a subset of patients (with abnormal glucose measurements at randomization) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] were enrolled for a placebo-controlled 160-week period instead, followed by a 12-week off-treatment follow-up. For those participating in this 160-week period, patients received liraglutide for a mean treatment duration of 110 weeks (median, 159 weeks). For all trials, dosing was initiated and increased weekly to reach the 3 mg dose. In adult clinical trials, 9.8% of patients treated with liraglutide and 4.3% of patients treated with placebo prematurely discontinued treatment as a result of adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2.9% versus 0.2% for liraglutide and placebo, respectively), vomiting (1.7% versus less than 0.1%), and diarrhea (1.4% versus 0%). Adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 2% of liraglutide-treated adult patients and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients are shown in Table 4. Adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 3% of liraglutide-treated pediatric patients and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients are shown in Table 5. Table 4.

Pediatric patients did not have type 2 diabetes mellitus. See text below for more detailed hypoglycemia information. Hypoglycemia Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes In a clinical trial in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and overweight (excess weight) or obesity, severe hypoglycemia (defined as requiring the assistance of another person) occurred in 3 (0.7%) of 422 liraglutide-treated patients (all taking a sulfonylurea) and in none of the 212 placebo-treated patients. In this trial, among patients taking a sulfonylurea, hypoglycemia defined as a plasma glucose less than 54 mg/dL with or without symptoms occurred in 31 (28.2%) of 110 liraglutide-treated patients and 7 (12.7%) of 55 placebo-treated patients. The doses of sulfonylureas were reduced by 50% at the beginning of the trial per protocol. Among patients not taking a sulfonylurea, blood glucose less than 54 mg/dL with or without symptoms occurred in 22 (7.1%) of 312 liraglutide-treated patients and 7 (4.5%) of 157 placebo-treated patients. In a liraglutide clinical trial in adult patients with overweight (excess weight) or obesity with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with basal insulin and liraglutide in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity and up to 2 oral anti-diabetes medications, severe hypoglycemia was reported by 3 (1.5%) of 195 liraglutide-treated patients and 2 (1.0%) of 197 placebo-treated patients. No meaningful difference in hypoglycemia, defined as blood glucose less than 54 mg/dL with or without symptoms, was reported between groups. Adult Patients without Type 2 Diabetes In liraglutide clinical trials in adult patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus, there was no systematic capturing or reporting of hypoglycemia; patients were not provided with blood glucose meters or hypoglycemia diaries. Spontaneously reported symptomatic episodes of unconfirmed hypoglycemia were reported by 46 (1.6%) of 2,962 liraglutide-treated patients and 19 (1.1%) of 1,729 placebo-treated patients. Fasting plasma glucose values obtained at routine clinic visits less than 54 mg/dL, irrespective of hypoglycemic symptoms, occurred in 2 (0.1%) liraglutide-treated patients and 1 (0.1%) placebo-treated patients. Pediatric Patients without Type 2 Diabetes In a 56-week placebo-controlled clinical trial of pediatric patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus in which blood glucose meters were provided, 19 (15.2%) of liraglutide-treated patients had hypoglycemia with a blood glucose less than 70 mg/dL with symptoms as compared to 5 (4.0%) of placebo-treated patients. Four (4) events of hypoglycemia defined as a plasma glucose less than 54 mg/dL occurred in 2 (1.6%) of 125 liraglutide-treated patients and 1 event occurred in 1 (0.8%) of 126 placebo-treated patients. No severe hypoglycemic episodes, defined as requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions, occurred in the liraglutide treatment group. Acute Pancreatitis In liraglutide clinical trials in adults, acute pancreatitis was confirmed by adjudication in 9 (0.3%) of 3,291 liraglutide-treated patients and 2 (0.1%) of 1,843 placebo-treated patients. In addition, there were 2 cases of acute pancreatitis in liraglutide-treated patients who prematurely withdrew from these clinical trials, occurring 74 and 124 days after the last dose. There were 2 additional cases in liraglutide-treated patients, 1 during an off-treatment follow-up period within 2 weeks of discontinuing liraglutide, and 1 that occurred in a patient who completed treatment and was off-treatment for 106 days. In a liraglutide pediatric clinical trial, pancreatitis was not independently adjudicated. Pancreatitis was reported in 1 (0.8%) liraglutide-treated patient and resulted in treatment discontinuation. Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions In the adult clinical trials, approximately 68% of liraglutide-treated patients and 39% of placebo-treated patients reported gastrointestinal disorders; the most frequently reported was nausea (39% and 14% of patients treated with liraglutide and placebo, respectively). Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among patients receiving liraglutide (4.8%) than placebo (1.4 %). There have been reports of gastrointestinal adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, associated with volume depletion and renal impairment. Most episodes of gastrointestinal events were mild or moderate and did not lead to discontinuation of therapy (6.2% with liraglutide versus 0.8% with placebo discontinued treatment as a result of gastrointestinal adverse reactions). The percentage of patients reporting nausea declined as treatment continued. Other common adverse reactions that occurred at a higher incidence among liraglutide-treated patients included diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, dry mouth, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, flatulence, eructation and abdominal distension. There have been reports of gastrointestinal adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, associated with volume depletion and renal impairment. In a pediatric clinical trial, 8.0% of patients treated with liraglutide versus no patients who received placebo discontinued treatment as a result of gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Most adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were due to vomiting and nausea (4.8% and 3.2% of liraglutide-treated patients, respectively). Asthenia, Fatigue, Malaise, Dysgeusia and Dizziness Events of asthenia, fatigue, malaise, dysgeusia and dizziness were mainly reported within the first 12 weeks of treatment with liraglutide and were often co-reported with gastrointestinal events such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Immunogenicity The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, the incidence of antibodies to liraglutide cannot be directly compared with the incidence of antibodies of other products. Patients treated with liraglutide may develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. Anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 42 (2.8%) of 1,505 liraglutide-treated adult patients with a post-baseline assessment. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 18 (1.2%) of 1,505 liraglutide-treated patients. Presence of antibodies may be associated with a higher incidence of injection site reactions and reports of low blood glucose. In clinical trials, these events were usually classified as mild and resolved while patients continued on treatment. In a pediatric clinical trial, anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 14 (12%) of 117 liraglutide-treated patients with a post-baseline assessment; 5 (4.3%) had persistent antibodies as defined by more than 2 antibody visits at least 16 weeks apart. Two patients (1.7%) remained positive throughout the follow-up period; 1 (0.9%) had antibodies cross reactive to native GLP-1. No patients had neutralizing antibodies. Allergic Reactions Urticaria was reported in 0.7% of liraglutide-treated patients and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Anaphylactic reactions, asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, oropharyngeal swelling, facial swelling, angioedema, pharyngeal edema, type IV hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients treated with liraglutide in clinical trials. Cases of anaphylactic reactions with additional symptoms such as hypotension, palpitations, dyspnea, and edema have been reported with marketed use of liraglutide. Anaphylactic reactions may potentially be life-threatening. Breast Cancer In liraglutide clinical trials in adults, breast cancer confirmed by adjudication was reported in 17 (0.7%) of 2,379 liraglutide-treated women compared with 3 (0.2%) of 1,300 placebo-treated women, including invasive cancer (13 liraglutide- and 2 placebo-treated women) and ductal carcinoma in situ (4 liraglutide- and 1 placebo-treated woman). The majority of cancers were estrogen- and progesterone-receptor positive. There were too few cases to determine whether these cases were related to liraglutide. In addition, there are insufficient data to determine whether liraglutide has an effect on pre-existing breast neoplasia. Papillary Thyroid Cancer In liraglutide clinical trials in adults, papillary thyroid carcinoma confirmed by adjudication was reported in 8 (0.2%) of 3,291 liraglutide-treated patients compared with no cases among 1,843 placebo-treated patients. Four of these papillary thyroid carcinomas were less than 1 cm in greatest diameter and 4 were diagnosed in surgical pathology specimens after thyroidectomy prompted by findings identified prior to treatment. Colorectal Neoplasms In liraglutide clinical trials in adults, benign colorectal neoplasms (mostly colon adenomas) confirmed by adjudication were reported in 20 (0.6%) of 3,291 liraglutide-treated patients compared with 7 (0.4%) of 1,843 placebo-treated patients. Six positively adjudicated cases of malignant colorectal neoplasms were reported in 5 liraglutide-treated patients (0.2%, mostly adenocarcinomas) and 1 in a placebo-treated patient (0.1%, neuroendocrine tumor of the rectum). Cardiac Conduction Disorders In liraglutide clinical trials in adults, 11 (0.3%) of 3,384 liraglutide-treated patients compared with none of the 1,941 placebo-treated patients had a cardiac conduction disorder, reported as first degree atrioventricular block, right bundle branch block, or left bundle branch block. Hypotension Adverse reactions related to hypotension (hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, circulatory collapse, and decreased blood pressure) were reported more frequently with liraglutide (1.1%) compared with placebo (0.5%) in liraglutide clinical trials in adults. Systolic blood pressure decreases to less than 80 mmHg were observed in 4 (0.1%) liraglutide-treated patients compared with no placebo-treated patients. One of the liraglutide-treated patients had hypotension associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions and renal failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Laboratory Abnormalities Liver Enzymes Increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than or equal to 10 times the upper limit of normal were observed in 5 (0.15%) liraglutide-treated patients (two of whom had ALT greater than 20 and 40 times the upper limit of normal) compared with 1 (0.05%) placebo-treated patient during the liraglutide clinical trials. Because clinical evaluation to exclude alternative causes of ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increases was not done in most cases, the relationship to liraglutide is uncertain. Some increases in ALT and AST were associated with other confounding factors (such as gallstones). Serum Calcitonin Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . More patients treated with liraglutide in the clinical trials were observed to have high calcitonin values during treatment, compared with placebo. The proportion of patients with calcitonin greater than or equal to 2 times the upper limit of normal at the end of the trial was 1.2% in liraglutide-treated patients and 0.6% in placebo-treated patients. Calcitonin values greater than 20 ng/L at the end of the trial occurred in 0.5% of liraglutide-treated patients and 0.2% of placebo-treated patients; among patients with pre-treatment serum calcitonin less than 20 ng/L, none had calcitonin elevations to greater than 50 ng/L at the end of the trial. Serum Lipase and Amylase Serum lipase and amylase were routinely measured in the liraglutide clinical trials. Among liraglutide-treated patients, 2.1% had a lipase value at anytime during treatment of greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal compared with 1.0% of placebo-treated patients. 0.1% of liraglutide-treated patients had an amylase value at anytime in the trial of greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal versus 0.1% of placebo-treated patients. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with liraglutide is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of liraglutide, the active ingredient of liraglutide injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal Acute pancreatitis; hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis, sometimes resulting in death; ileus, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea leading to dehydration Hepatobiliary Hyperbilirubinemia, elevations of liver enzymes, cholestasis and hepatitis Hypersensitivity rash, pruritus, angioedema and anaphylactic reactions Neoplasms Medullary thyroid carcinoma Neurologic Dysesthesia Pulmonary Pulmonary aspiration has occurred in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation. Renal Acute renal failure or worsening of chronic renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis; increased serum creatinine General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Allergic reactions: rash and pruritus Immune System Angioedema and anaphylactic reactions Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Cutaneous amyloidosis, alopecia"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. When pregnancy is recognized, discontinue liraglutide. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to liraglutide during pregnancy. Liraglutide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Additionally, weight loss offers no benefit to a pregnant patient and may cause fetal harm. When a pregnancy is recognized, advise the pregnant patient of the risk to a fetus, and discontinue liraglutide (see Clinical Considerations) . Animal reproduction studies identified increased adverse embryofetal developmental outcomes from exposure during pregnancy. Liraglutide exposure was associated with early embryonic deaths and an imbalance in some fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats administered liraglutide during organogenesis at doses that approximate clinical exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3 mg/day. In pregnant rabbits administered liraglutide during organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of major fetal abnormalities were seen at exposures below the human exposures at the MRHD [see Animal Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryofetal risk Appropriate weight gain based on pre-pregnancy weight is currently recommended for all pregnant patients, including those who already have overweight or obesity, because of the obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Animal Data Liraglutide has been shown to be teratogenic in rats at or above 0.8-times systemic exposures in obese humans resulting from the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3 mg/day based on plasma area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) comparison. Liraglutide has been shown to cause reduced growth and increased total major abnormalities in rabbits at systemic exposures below exposure in obese humans at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. Female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide beginning 2 weeks before mating through gestation day 17 had estimated systemic exposures 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times the exposure in obese humans at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. The number of early embryonic deaths in the 1 mg/kg/day group increased slightly. Fetal abnormalities and variations in kidneys and blood vessels, irregular ossification of the skull, and a more complete state of ossification occurred at all doses. Mottled liver and minimally kinked ribs occurred at the highest dose. The incidence of fetal malformations in liraglutide-treated groups exceeding concurrent and historical controls were misshapen oropharynx and/or narrowed opening into larynx at 0.1 mg/kg/day and umbilical hernia at 0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg/day. Pregnant rabbits given subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through day 18 inclusive, had estimated systemic exposures less than the exposure in obese humans at the MRHD of 3 mg/day at all doses, based on plasma AUC comparison. Liraglutide decreased fetal weight and dose-dependently increased the incidence of total major fetal abnormalities at all doses. The incidence of malformations exceeded concurrent and historical controls at 0.01 mg/kg/day (kidneys, scapula), greater than or equal to 0.01 mg/kg/day (eyes, forelimb), 0.025 mg/kg/day (brain, tail and sacral vertebrae, major blood vessels and heart, umbilicus), greater than or equal to 0.025 mg/kg/day (sternum) and at 0.05 mg/kg/day (parietal bones, major blood vessels). Irregular ossification and/or skeletal abnormalities occurred in the skull and jaw, vertebrae and ribs, sternum, pelvis, tail, and scapula; and dose-dependent minor skeletal variations were observed. Visceral abnormalities occurred in blood vessels, lung, liver, and esophagus. Bilobed or bifurcated gallbladder was seen in all treatment groups, but not in the control group. In pregnant female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through weaning or termination of nursing on lactation day 24, estimated systemic exposures were 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times exposure in obese humans at the MRHD of 3 mg/day, based on plasma AUC comparison. A slight delay in parturition was observed in the majority of treated rats. Group mean body weight of neonatal rats from liraglutide-treated dams was lower than neonatal rats from control group dams. Bloody scabs and agitated behavior occurred in male rats descended from dams treated with 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide. Group mean body weight from birth to postpartum day 14 trended lower in F 2 generation rats descended from liraglutide-treated rats compared to F 2 generation rats descended from controls, but differences did not reach statistical significance for any group. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of liraglutide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or effects on milk production. Liraglutide was present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for liraglutide and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liraglutide or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In lactating rats, liraglutide was present unchanged in milk at concentrations approximately 50% of maternal plasma concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management have been established in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with body weight above 60 kg and an initial BMI corresponding to 30 kg/m 2 or greater for adults (obese) by international cut-offs (see Table 2). Use of liraglutide for this indication is supported by a 56-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 251 pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years, a pharmacokinetic study in pediatric patients, and studies in adults with obesity [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.2 )]. In the pediatric clinical trial, there was one death due to suicide in a liraglutide-treated patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] ; one liraglutide-treated patient had an event of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] ; more episodes of hypoglycemia confirmed by self blood glucose monitoring occurred in liraglutide-treated patients compared to placebo [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] ; and mean increases in resting heart rate of 3 to 7 bpm from baseline were observed with liraglutide-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide have not been established in patients less than 12 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the liraglutide clinical trials, 232 (6.9%) of the liraglutide-treated patients were 65 years of age and over, and 17 (0.5%) of the liraglutide-treated patients were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment There is limited experience with liraglutide in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, including end\u2011stage renal disease. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There is limited experience in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, liraglutide should be used with caution in this patient population [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Liraglutide is an acylated human GLP-1 receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37). Like endogenous GLP-1, liraglutide binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, a cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase activation through the stimulatory G-protein, Gs. Endogenous GLP-1 has a half-life of 1.5 to 2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once-daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding, and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-4 and NEP. GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and calorie intake, and the GLP-1 receptor is present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation. In animal studies, peripheral administration of liraglutide resulted in the presence of liraglutide in specific brain regions regulating appetite, including the hypothalamus. Although liraglutide activated neurons in brain regions known to regulate appetite, specific brain regions mediating the effects of liraglutide on appetite were not identified in rats. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide lowers body weight through decreased calorie intake. Liraglutide does not increase 24-hour energy expenditure. As with other GLP-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide stimulates insulin secretion and reduces glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. These effects can lead to a reduction of blood glucose. Gastric Emptying Liraglutide delays gastric emptying. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) in healthy volunteers The effect of liraglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide at steady-state concentrations after daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. The maximum liraglutide plasma concentration (C max ) in overweight and obese subjects treated with liraglutide 3 mg is similar to the C max observed in the liraglutide QTc study in healthy volunteers. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption - Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 11 hours post dosing. The average liraglutide steady state concentration (AUC\u03c4 /24 ) reached approximately 116 ng/mL in obese (BMI 30 to 40 kg/m 2 ) subjects following administration of liraglutide. Liraglutide exposure increased proportionally in the dose range of 0.6 mg to 3 mg. The intra-subject coefficient of variation for liraglutide AUC was 11% following single dose administration. Liraglutide exposures were considered similar among three subcutaneous injection sites (upper arm, abdomen, and thigh). Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution - The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide 3 mg is 20 to 25 L (for a person weighing approximately 100 kg). The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (greater than 98%). Metabolism - During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [3H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Elimination - Following a [3H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 0.9 to 1.4 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours, making liraglutide suitable for once daily administration. Specific Populations Elderly - Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of data from overweight and obese patients 18 to 82 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . Gender - Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 24% lower weight adjusted clearance of liraglutide compared to males. Race and Ethnicity - Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included overweight and obese patients of White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic/Non-Hispanic Ethnic groups. Body Weight - Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses conducted in patients with body weight range of 60 to 234 kg. The exposure of liraglutide decreases as baseline body weight increases. Pediatric - A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide using data from 134 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years of age) with obesity. The liraglutide exposure in the pediatric patients was similar to that in adults with obesity [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Renal Impairment - The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min) renal impairment and patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Hepatic Impairment - The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5 to 6) to severe (Child Pugh score greater than 9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Drug Interactions In vitro assessment of drug\u2212drug interactions Liraglutide has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug\u2212drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. The effect on rate of gastric emptying was equivalent between liraglutide 1.8 mg and 3 mg (acetaminophen AUC 0-300min ). Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide (8 to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Liraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The coadministration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide. Atorvastatin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide. Acetaminophen Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following coadministration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide lowers body weight through decreased calorie intake. Liraglutide does not increase 24-hour energy expenditure. As with other GLP-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide stimulates insulin secretion and reduces glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. These effects can lead to a reduction of blood glucose. Gastric Emptying Liraglutide delays gastric emptying. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) in healthy volunteers The effect of liraglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide at steady-state concentrations after daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. The maximum liraglutide plasma concentration (C max ) in overweight and obese subjects treated with liraglutide 3 mg is similar to the C max observed in the liraglutide QTc study in healthy volunteers."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption - Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 11 hours post dosing. The average liraglutide steady state concentration (AUC\u03c4 /24 ) reached approximately 116 ng/mL in obese (BMI 30 to 40 kg/m 2 ) subjects following administration of liraglutide. Liraglutide exposure increased proportionally in the dose range of 0.6 mg to 3 mg. The intra-subject coefficient of variation for liraglutide AUC was 11% following single dose administration. Liraglutide exposures were considered similar among three subcutaneous injection sites (upper arm, abdomen, and thigh). Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution - The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide 3 mg is 20 to 25 L (for a person weighing approximately 100 kg). The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (greater than 98%). Metabolism - During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [3H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Elimination - Following a [3H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 0.9 to 1.4 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours, making liraglutide suitable for once daily administration. Specific Populations Elderly - Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of data from overweight and obese patients 18 to 82 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . Gender - Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 24% lower weight adjusted clearance of liraglutide compared to males. Race and Ethnicity - Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included overweight and obese patients of White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic/Non-Hispanic Ethnic groups. Body Weight - Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses conducted in patients with body weight range of 60 to 234 kg. The exposure of liraglutide decreases as baseline body weight increases. Pediatric - A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide using data from 134 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years of age) with obesity. The liraglutide exposure in the pediatric patients was similar to that in adults with obesity [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Renal Impairment - The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min) renal impairment and patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Hepatic Impairment - The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5 to 6) to severe (Child Pugh score greater than 9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Drug Interactions In vitro assessment of drug\u2212drug interactions Liraglutide has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug\u2212drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. The effect on rate of gastric emptying was equivalent between liraglutide 1.8 mg and 3 mg (acetaminophen AUC 0-300min ). Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide (8 to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Liraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The coadministration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide. Atorvastatin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide. Acetaminophen Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following coadministration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

A dose-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in the 1 and the 3 mg/kg/day groups with incidences of 13% and 19% in males and 6% and 20% in females, respectively. C-cell adenomas did not occur in control groups or 0.03 and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. Treatment-related malignant C-cell carcinomas occurred in 3% of females in the 3 mg/kg/day group. Thyroid C-cell tumors are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in mice. A treatment-related increase in fibrosarcomas was seen on the dorsal skin and subcutis, the body surface used for drug injection, in males in the 3 mg/kg/day group. These fibrosarcomas were attributed to the high local concentration of drug near the injection site. The liraglutide concentration in the clinical formulation (6 mg/mL) is 10-times higher than the concentration in the formulation used to administer 3 mg/kg/day liraglutide to mice in the carcinogenicity study (0.6 mg/mL). A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0.075, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection with exposures 0.5-, 2- and 7-times the exposure in obese humans, respectively, resulting from the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. A treatment-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in males in 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide groups with incidences of 12%, 16%, 42%, and 46% and in all female liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 10%, 27%, 33%, and 56% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. A treatment-related increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in all male liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 2%, 8%, 6%, and 14% and in females at 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day with incidences of 0%, 0%, 4%, and 6% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. Thyroid C-cell carcinomas are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in rats. Studies in mice demonstrated that liraglutide-induced C-cell proliferation was dependent on the GLP-1 receptor and that liraglutide did not cause activation of the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene in thyroid C-cells. Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats is unknown and has not been determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Liraglutide was negative with and without metabolic activation in the Ames test for mutagenicity and in a human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test for clastogenicity. Liraglutide was negative in repeat-dose in vivo micronucleus tests in rats. In rat fertility studies using subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating until gestation day 17. No direct adverse effects on male fertility was observed at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day, a high dose yielding an estimated systemic exposure 11-times the exposure in obese humans at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC comparison. In female rats, an increase in early embryonic deaths occurred at 1 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain and food consumption were observed in females at the 1 mg/kg/day dose."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Weight Management Trials in Adults with Overweight or Obesity The safety and efficacy of liraglutide for chronic weight management in conjunction with reduced caloric intake and increased physical activity were studied in three 56-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In all studies, liraglutide was titrated to 3 mg daily during a 4-week period. All patients received instruction for a reduced-calorie diet (approximately 500 kcal/day deficit) and physical activity counseling (recommended increase in physical activity of minimum 150 mins/week) that began with the first dose of study medication or placebo and continued throughout the trial. Study 1 enrolled 3,731 patients with obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 ) or with overweight (BMI 27 to 29.9 kg/m 2 ) and at least one weight-related comorbid condition such as treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either liraglutide or placebo. Patients were stratified based on the presence or absence of abnormal blood glucose measurements at randomization. All patients were treated for up to 56 weeks. Those patients with abnormal glucose measurements at randomization (2,254 of the 3,731 patients) were treated for a total of 160 weeks. At baseline, mean age was 45 years (range 18 to 78), 79% were female, 85% were White, 10% were Black or African American, and 11% were Hispanic/Latino Ethnicity. Mean baseline body weight was 106.3 kg and mean BMI was 38.3 kg/m 2 . Study 2 was a 56-week trial that enrolled 635 patients with type 2 diabetes and with either overweight or obesity (as defined above). Patients were to have an HbA 1c of 7% to 10% and be treated with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or a glitazone as single agent or in any combination, or with a reduced-calorie diet and physical activity alone. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either liraglutide or placebo. The mean age was 55 years (range 18 to 82), 50% were female, 83% were White, 12% were Black or African American, and 10% were Hispanic/Latino Ethnicity. Mean baseline body weight was 105.9 kg and mean BMI was 37.1 kg/m 2 . Study 3 was a 56-week trial that enrolled 422 patients with obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 ) or with overweight (BMI 27 to 29.9 kg/m 2 ) and at least one weight-related comorbid condition such as treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. All patients were first treated with a low-calorie diet (total energy intake 1,200 to 1,400 kcal/day) in a run-in period lasting up to 12 weeks. Patients who lost at least 5% of their screening body weight after 4 to 12 weeks during the run-in were then randomized, with equal allocation, to receive either liraglutide or placebo for 56 weeks. The mean age was 46 years (range 18 to 73), 81% were female, 84% were White, 13% were Black or African American, and 7% were Hispanic/Latino Ethnicity. Mean baseline body weight was 99.6 kg and mean BMI was 35.6 kg/m 2 . The proportions of patients who discontinued study drug in the 56-week trials were 27% for the liraglutide-treated group and 35% for the placebo-treated group, and in the 160-week trial the proportions of patients who discontinued were 47% and 55%, respectively. In the 56-week trials, approximately 10% of patients treated with liraglutide and 4% of patients treated with placebo discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The majority of patients who discontinued liraglutide due to adverse reactions did so during the first few months of treatment. In the 160-week trial the proportions of patients who discontinued due to an adverse reaction was 13% and 6% for liraglutide- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Effect of Liraglutide on Body Weight in 56-week Trials For Study 1 and Study 2, the primary efficacy parameters were mean percent change in body weight and the percentages of patients achieving greater than or equal to 5% and 10% weight loss from baseline to week 56. For Study 3, the primary efficacy parameters were mean percent change in body weight from randomization to week 56, the percentage of patients not gaining more than 0.5% body weight from randomization (i.e., after run-in) to week 56, and the percentage of patients achieving greater than or equal to 5% weight loss from randomization to week 56. Because losing at least 5% of fasting body weight through lifestyle intervention during the 4- to 12-week run-in was a condition for their continued participation in the randomized treatment period, the results may not reflect those expected in the general population. Table 6 presents the results for the changes in weight observed in Studies 1, 2, and 3. After 56 weeks, treatment with liraglutide resulted in a statistically significant reduction in weight compared with placebo. Statistically significantly greater proportions of patients treated with liraglutide achieved 5% and 10% weight loss than those treated with placebo. In Study 3, statistically significantly more patients randomized to liraglutide than placebo had not gained more than 0.5% of body weight from randomization to week 56. Table 6.

All available body weight data during the 56 week treatment period are included in the analysis. In Studies 1 and 2 missing values for week 56 were handled using multiple imputations analysis. In Study 3 missing values for week 56 were handled using weighted regression analysis. The cumulative frequency distributions of change in body weight from baseline to week 56 are shown in Figure 2 for Studies 1 and 2. One way to interpret this figure is to select a change in body weight of interest on the horizontal axis and note the corresponding proportions of patients (vertical axis) in each treatment group who achieved at least that degree of weight loss. For example, note that the vertical line arising from \u201110% in Study 1 intersects the liraglutide and placebo curves at approximately 34% and 15%, respectively, which correspond to the values shown in Table 6.

After a 12-week lifestyle run-in period, patients were randomized 1:1 to liraglutide once-daily or placebo once-daily. The liraglutide dose was titrated to 3 mg over a 4- to 8-week period based on tolerability as judged by the investigator. Escalation of the trial product was not allowed if the subject had a self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) < 56 mg/dL or < 70 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms of hypoglycemia during the week prior to or during the dose escalation visits. The proportion of patients who reached the 3 mg dose was 82.4%; for 8.8% of patients 2.4 mg was the maximum tolerated dose. The mean age was 14.5 years: 40.6% of patients were male, 87.6% were White, 0.8% were Asian, 8% were Black or African American; 22.3% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean baseline body weight was 100.8 kg, and mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 35.6 kg/m 2 . The proportions of patients who discontinued study drug were 19.2% for the liraglutide-treated group and 20.6% for the placebo-treated group; 10.4% of patients treated with liraglutide and no patients treated with placebo discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . The primary endpoint was change in BMI SDS. At baseline, mean BMI SDS was 3.14 in the liraglutide group and 3.20 in the placebo group. At week 56, treatment with liraglutide resulted in statistically significant reduction in BMI SDS from baseline compared to placebo. The observed mean change in BMI SDS from baseline to week 56 was -0.23 in the liraglutide group and -0.00 in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference in BMI SDS reduction from baseline between liraglutide and placebo was -0.22 with a 95% confidence interval of -0.37, -0.08; p=0.0022. The time course of change in BMI SDS with liraglutide and placebo from baseline through week 56 are depicted in Figure 5. Figure 5.

The efficacy of liraglutide at doses below 3 mg daily has not been established for chronic weight management. The LEADER trial (NCT01179048) randomized 9,340 patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease to liraglutide 1.8 mg or placebo in addition to standard of care treatments for type 2 diabetes for a median duration of 3.5 years. Patients either were 50 years of age or older with established, stable cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, peripheral vascular disease, chronic renal failure or chronic heart failure (80% of patients), or were 60 years of age or older and had other specified risk factors of vascular disease (20% of patients).The population was 64% male, 78% White, 10% Asian and 8% Black or African American; 12% of the population was Hispanic or Latino Ethnicity. In total, 96.8% of the patients completed the trial; vital status was known at the end of the trial for 99.7%. The primary endpoint was the time from randomization to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) defined as: cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. No increased risk for MACE was observed with liraglutide 1.8 mg. The total number of primary component MACE endpoints was 1,302 (608 [13.0%] with liraglutide 1.8 mg and 694 [14.9%] with placebo)."

      "16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING 16.1 How Supplied Liraglutide injection: 6 mg/mL clear, colorless solution in a 3 mL single-patient-use pre-filled pen that delivers doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg or 3 mg is available in the following package size: 5 x liraglutide injection pen NDC 0480-7250-46 16.2 Recommended Storage Prior to first use, liraglutide injection should be stored in a refrigerator between 36\u00baF to 46\u00baF (2\u00baC to 8\u00baC). Do not store in the freezer or directly adjacent to the refrigerator cooling element. Do not freeze liraglutide injection and do not use liraglutide injection if it has been frozen. After initial use of the liraglutide injection pen, the pen can be stored for 30 days at controlled room temperature (59\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F; 15\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C) or in a refrigerator (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F; 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Keep the pen cap on when not in use. Protect liraglutide injection from excessive heat and sunlight. Always remove and safely discard the needle after each injection and store the liraglutide injection pen without an injection needle attached. This will reduce the potential for contamination, infection, and leakage while also ensuring dosing accuracy."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use). Instructions Advise patients to take liraglutide injection exactly as prescribed. Instruct patients to follow the dose escalation schedule and to not take more than the recommended dose. Instruct adult patients to discontinue liraglutide injection if they have not achieved 4% weight loss by 16 weeks of treatment. Instruct pediatric patients 12 years of age and older to discontinue liraglutide injection if they have not achieved a BMI reduction of 1% from baseline after 12 weeks on the maintenance dose. Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Inform patients that liraglutide causes benign and malignant thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats and that the human relevance of this finding has not been determined. Counsel patients to report symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a lump in the neck, hoarseness, dysphagia or dyspnea) to their health care provider [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Acute Pancreatitis Inform patients of the potential risk for acute pancreatitis and its symptoms: severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back, and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting. Instruct patients to discontinue liraglutide injection promptly and contact their healthcare provider if pancreatitis is suspected [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Acute Gallbladder Disease Inform patients of the risk of acute gallbladder disease. Advise patients that substantial or rapid weight loss can increase the risk of gallbladder disease, but that gallbladder disease may also occur in the absence of substantial or rapid weight loss. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider for appropriate clinical follow-up if gallbladder disease is suspected [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypoglycemia Inform pediatric patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. Inform adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin that they may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia when using liraglutide injection and to report signs and/or symptoms of hypoglycemia to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Heart Rate Increase Inform patients to report symptoms of sustained periods of heart pounding or racing while at rest to their healthcare provider. Discontinue liraglutide injection in patients who experience a sustained increase in resting heart rate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion Inform patients of the potential risk of acute kidney injury due to dehydration associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Advise patients to take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury and instruct them to promptly report any of these signs or symptoms or persistent (or extended) nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Inform patients of the potential risk of severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if they have severe or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients that serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of liraglutide injection. Advise patients on the symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and instruct them to stop taking liraglutide injection and seek medical advice promptly if such symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Advise patients to report emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Inform patients that if they experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors, they should stop taking liraglutide injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation Inform patients that liraglutide injection may cause their stomach to empty more slowly which may lead to complications with anesthesia or deep sedation during planned surgeries or procedures. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking liraglutide injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] . Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients Inform patients that they should never share a liraglutide injection pen with another person, even if the needle is changed. Sharing of the pen between patients may pose a risk of transmission of infection. Brands listed are the trademarks of their respective owners. Manufactured In Croatia By: Pliva Hrvatska d.o.o.

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Liraglutide (lir\" a gloo' tide) Injection Read these instructions carefully before using your liraglutide injection pen. Do not use your pen without proper training from your healthcare provider. Make sure that you know how to give yourself an injection with the pen before you start your treatment. If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this pen without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the liraglutide injection pen . Start by checking your pen to make sure that it contains liraglutide injection, then look at the pictures below to get to know the different parts of your pen and needle. Your pen is a prefilled, dial-a-dose, single-patient-use pen. It contains 18 mg of liraglutide, and you can select doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg and 3 mg. Your pen is compatible with universal fit disposable pen needles up to a length of 8 mm, including NovoFine \u00ae . Compatible needles will state ISO11608-2 on the outer packaging. Your pen is not compatible with NovoTwist \u00ae disposable needles. Pen needles are not included with your liraglutide injection pen. Liraglutide injection pen and needle (example) Step 1. Prepare your pen with a new needle Wash your hands with soap and water. Check the name and colored label of your pen, to make sure that it contains liraglutide injection. This is especially important if you take more than 1 type of medicine. Pull off the pen cap. Check that liraglutide injection in your pen is clear and colorless. Look through the pen window. If liraglutide injection looks cloudy, do not use the pen. Take a new needle, and tear off the paper tab. Push the needle straight onto the pen. Turn until it is on tight. Pull off the outer needle cap. Do not throw it away. Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. A drop of liraglutide injection may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you must still check the liraglutide injection flow, if you use a new pen for the first time. Always use a new needle for each injection. This will prevent contamination, infection, leakage of liraglutide injection, and blocked needles leading to the wrong dose. Never use a bent or damaged needle. Do not attach a new needle to your pen until you are ready to take your injection. Step 2. Check the liraglutide injection flow with each new pen. Check the liraglutide injection flow before your first injection with each new pen. If your liraglutide injection pen is already in use, go to Step 3 \u201cSelect your dose\u201d. Turn the dose selector until the dose counter shows the flow check symbol ( ). Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. Press and push in the dose button until the dose counter shows 0. The black arrow indicating 0 must appear in the notch. A drop of liraglutide injection will appear at the needle tip. If no drop appears, repeat Step 2 above as shown in Figures G and H up to 6 times. If there is still no drop, change the needle and repeat Step 2 as shown in Figures G and H 1 more time. Do not use the pen if a drop of liraglutide injection still does not appear . Contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872. Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you use a new pen for the first time. This makes sure that liraglutide injection flows. If no drop appears, you will not inject any liraglutide injection, even though the dose counter may move. This may mean that there is a blocked or damaged needle. A small drop may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. Only check the liraglutide injection flow before your first injection with each new pen. Step 3. Select your dose Turn the dose selector until the dose counter shows your dose (0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg or 3 mg). Make sure you know the dose of liraglutide injection you should use. If you select the wrong dose, you can turn the dose selector forward or backwards to the correct dose. Always use the dose counter and the black arrow in the notch to see how many mg you select. You will hear a \u201cclick\u201d every time you turn the dose selector and it will extend from the pen body as the dose increases. Do not set the dose by counting the number of clicks you hear. Do not use the pen scale to set the dose. It does not show exactly how much liraglutide injection is left in your pen. Only doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg or 3 mg can be selected with the dose selector. The black arrow indicating the selected dose must appear in the notch to make sure that you get a correct dose. The dose selector changes the dose. Only the dose counter and black arrow in the notch will show how many mg you select for each dose. You can select up to 3 mg each dose. When your pen contains less than 3 mg the dose counter stops before 3 mg is shown. How much liraglutide injection is left? The pen scale shows you about how much liraglutide injection is left in your pen. To see how much liraglutide injection is left, use the dose counter : Turn the dose selector until the dose counter stops. If it shows 3 mg, at least 3 mg are left in your pen. If the dose counter stops before 3 mg, there is not enough liraglutide injection left for a full dose of 3 mg. If you need more liraglutide injection than what is left in your pen Only if trained or told by your healthcare provider, you may split your dose between your current pen and a new pen. Use a calculator to plan the doses as instructed by your healthcare provider. Be very careful to calculate correctly. If you are not sure how to split your dose using 2 pens, then select and inject the dose you need with a new pen. Step 4. Inject your dose Insert the needle into your skin as your healthcare provider has shown you. Make sure you can see the dose counter. Do not cover it with your fingers. This could stop the injection. Press and push down the dose button until the dose counter shows 0. The dose selector will retract into the body of the pen and will stop when the dose counter shows 0. The black arrow indicating 0 must appear in the notch. Keep the needle in your skin after the dose counter has returned to 0 and count slowly to 6. If the needle is removed earlier, you may see a stream of liraglutide injection coming from the needle tip. If this happens, the full dose will not be delivered. Remove the needle from your skin. If blood appears at the injection site, press lightly. Do not rub the area. Always watch the dose counter to know how many mg you inject. Push the dose button down until the dose counter shows 0. How to identify a blocked or damaged needle? If 0 does not appear in the dose counter after continuously pressing the dose button, you may have used a blocked or damaged needle. If this happens you have not received any liraglutide injection even though the dose counter has moved from the original dose that you have set. How to handle a blocked needle? Change the needle as described in Step 5, and repeat all steps starting with Step 1: \u201cPrepare your pen with a new needle\u201d . Make sure you select the full dose you need. Never touch the dose counter when you inject. This can stop the injection. You may see a drop of liraglutide injection at the needle tip after injecting. This is normal and does not affect your dose. Step 5. After your injection Carefully remove the needle from the pen. Do not put the needle caps back on the needle, to avoid needle sticks. Place the needle in a sharps container right away to reduce the risk of needle sticks. Put the pen cap on your pen after each use to protect liraglutide injection from light. If you do not have a sharps container, follow a 1-handed needle recapping method. Carefully slip the needle into the outer needle cap. Dispose of the needle in a sharps container as soon as possible. Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the needle. Always remove the needle from your pen. This prevents contamination, infection, leakage of liraglutide injection, and blocked needles leading to the wrong dose. If the needle is blocked, you will not inject any liraglutide injection. Always dispose of the needle after each injection . Do not throw away in the household trash. Put the needle and any empty liraglutide injection pen or any pen used for 30 days still containing liraglutide injection in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out upright and stable during use leak-resistant properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about the safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. Safely dispose of liraglutide injection that is out of date or no longer needed. Important Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles to prevent needle sticks and cross infection. Never use a syringe to withdraw liraglutide injection from your pen. Always carry an extra pen and new needles with you, in case of loss or damage. Always keep your pen and needles out of reach of others, especially children. Do not share your liraglutide injection pen or needles with anyone else. You may give an infection to them or get an infection from them. Always keep your pen with you. Do not leave it in a car or other place where it can get too hot or too cold. Caring for your pen Do not drop your pen or knock it against hard surfaces. If you drop it or suspect a problem, attach a new needle and check the liraglutide injection flow before you inject. Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart. Do not expose your pen to dust, dirt or liquid. Do not wash, soak, or lubricate your pen. If necessary, clean it with mild detergent on a moistened cloth. How should I store my liraglutide injection pen? Store your new, unused liraglutide injection pens in the refrigerator at 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Store your pen in use for 30 days at 59\u00baF to 86\u00baF (15\u00baC to 30\u00baC) or in a refrigerator at 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). The liraglutide injection pen you are using should be thrown away after 30 days, even if it still has liraglutide injection left in it. Do not freeze liraglutide injection. Do not use liraglutide injection if it has been frozen. Unused liraglutide injection pens may be used until the expiration date printed on the label, if kept in the refrigerator. Keep liraglutide injection away from heat and out of the light. This Medication Guide and Instructions for Use have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult Patients: Initiate at 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for one week then increase to 1.2 mg daily. If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dose to 1.8 mg daily after one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg daily dose. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric Patients: Initiate at 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for at least one week. If additional glycemic control is required increase the dose to 1.2 mg daily and if additional glycemic control is still required, increase the dose to 1.8 mg daily after at least one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg daily dose. ( 2.1 ) Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles. ( 2.3 ) Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously once-daily at any time of day, independently of meals, in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. ( 2.3 ) When using liraglutide injection with insulin, administer as separate injections. Never mix. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Adult Patients The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide injection is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for one week. The 0.6 mg once daily dosage is intended to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] during initial titration and is not effective for glycemic control in adults. After one week at the 0.6 mg once daily dosage, increase the dosage to 1.2 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage to the maximum recommended dosage of 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily after at least one week of treatment with the 1.2 mg once daily dosage. Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older The recommended starting dosage of liraglutide injection is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. If additional glycemic control is required, increase the dosage in 0.6 mg increments after at least one week on the current dosage, to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The maximum recommended dosage is 1.8 mg injected subcutaneously once daily. 2.2 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose Instruct patients who miss a dose of liraglutide injection to resume the once -daily dosage regimen as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Do not administer an extra dose or increase the dose to make up for the missed dose. If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last liraglutide injection dose, reinitiate liraglutide injection at 0.6 mg once daily to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with reinitiation of treatment. Upon reinitiation, liraglutide injection should be titrated at the discretion of the healthcare provider. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles. Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously once daily at any time of day, independently of meals. Inject liraglutide injection subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. No dosage adjustment is needed if changing the injection site and/or timing. Rotate injection sites within the same region in order to reduce the risk of cutaneous amyloidosis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. When using liraglutide injection with insulin, administer as separate injections. Never mix. It is acceptable to inject liraglutide injection and insulin in the same body region but the injections should not be adjacent to each other."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Pancreatitis: Has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide injection. Discontinue if pancreatitis is suspected.( 5.2 ) Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients , even if the needle is changed. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia : Adult patients taking an insulin secretagogue or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection regardless of insulin and/or metformin use. Reduction in the dose of insulin secretagogues or insulin may be necessary. ( 5.4 ) Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion: Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions that could lead to volume depletion. ( 5.5 ) Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions : Use has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe. Liraglutide injection is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis. ( 5.6 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema). Discontinue liraglutide injection and promptly seek medical advice. ( 5.7 ) Acute Gallbladder Disease : If cholelithiasis or cholecystitis are suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. ( 5.8 ) Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation : Has been reported in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers of any planned surgeries or procedures. (5.9) 5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether liraglutide injection will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and liraglutide injection use in humans. Liraglutide injection is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of liraglutide injection and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated. 5.2 Acute Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . After initiation of liraglutide injection, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis which may include persistent or severe abdominal pain (sometimes radiating to the back) and which may or may not be accompanied by nausea or vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue liraglutide injection and initiate appropriate management. 5.3 Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients Liraglutide injection pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Adult patients receiving liraglutide injection in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection regardless of insulin and/or metformin use. [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications and pediatric patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.5 Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, in some cases requiring hemodialysis, in patients treated with liraglutide injection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. The majority of the reported events occurred in patients who experienced gastrointestinal reactions leading to dehydration such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions to liraglutide injection that could lead to volume depletion, especially during dosage initiation and escalation of liraglutide injection. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.6 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide, has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . In liraglutide injection clinical trials, severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among patients receiving liraglutide injection (1.2 mg 4.4%, 1.8 mg 4.2%) than placebo (1.1%). Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have also been reported postmarketing with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Liraglutide injection is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with liraglutide injection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue liraglutide injection; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with liraglutide injection. Liraglutide injection is contraindicated in patients who have had a serious hypersensitivity reaction to liraglutide or any of the excipients in liraglutide injection [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.8 Acute Gallbladder Disease Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing. In the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] , 3.1% of liraglutide-treated patients versus 1.9% of placebo-treated patients reported an acute event of gallbladder disease, such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated. 5.9 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation Liraglutide injection delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations. Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking liraglutide injection, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing liraglutide injection could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking liraglutide injection."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information: Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Acute Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Acute Gallbladder Disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655%) in clinical trials are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, dyspepsia, constipation ( 6.1 ). Immunogenicity-related events, including urticaria, were more common among liraglutide-treated patients (0.8%) than among comparator-treated patients (0.4%) in clinical trials ( 12.6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Orbicular Pharmaceutical Technologies Private Limited at 1-888-370-4186 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Common Adverse Reactions The safety of liraglutide injection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled trials in adults and one trial of 52 weeks duration in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . The data in Table 1 reflect exposure of 1,673 adult patients to liraglutide injection and a mean duration of exposure to liraglutide injection of 37.3 weeks. The mean age of adult patients was 58 years, 4% were 75 years or older and 54% were male. The population was 79% White, 6% Black or African American, 13% Asian; 4% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years and a mean HbA 1c of 8.4%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% and moderately impaired in 12% of the pooled population. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions in adults, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of liraglutide injection for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on liraglutide injection than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with liraglutide injection. Overall, the type, and severity of adverse reactions in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older and above were comparable to that observed in the adult population. Table 1.

In an analysis of placebo- and active-controlled trials, the types and frequency of common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, were similar to those listed in Table 1 . Other Adverse Reactions Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions In the pool of 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled adult clinical trials, withdrawals due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions, occurred in 4.3% of liraglutide-treated patients and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among patients receiving liraglutide injection (1.2 mg 4.4 %, 1.8 mg 4.2 %) than placebo (1.1 %). Withdrawal due to gastrointestinal adverse events mainly occurred during the first 2 to 3 months of the trials. Injection site reactions Injection site reactions (e.g., injection site rash, erythema) were reported in approximately 2% of liraglutide-treated adult patients in the five double-blind, glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration. Less than 0.2% of liraglutide-treated patients discontinued due to injection site reactions. Hypoglycemia In 5 adult glycemic control, placebo-controlled clinical trials of at least 26 weeks duration, hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person for treatment occurred in 8 liraglutide-treated patients (7.5 events per 1,000 patient-years). Of these 8 liraglutide-treated patients, 7 patients were concomitantly using a sulfonylurea. Table 2.

In a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with a 26-week open-label extension, 21.2% of liraglutide-treated patients (mean age 14.6 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus, had hypoglycemia with a blood glucose <54 mg/dL with or without symptoms (335 events per 1000 patient years). No severe hypoglycemic episodes occurred in the liraglutide injection treatment group (severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions). Papillary thyroid carcinoma In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there were 7 reported cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma in patients treated with liraglutide injection and 1 case in a comparator-treated patient (1.5 vs. 0.5 cases per 1000 patient-years). Most of these papillary thyroid carcinomas were <1 cm in greatest diameter and were diagnosed in surgical pathology specimens after thyroidectomy prompted by findings on protocol-specified screening with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound. Pancreatitis In glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there have been 13 cases of pancreatitis among liraglutide -treated patients and 1 case in a comparator (glimepiride) treated patient (2.7 vs. 0.5 cases per 1000 patient-years). Nine of the 13 cases with liraglutide were reported as acute pancreatitis and four were reported as chronic pancreatitis. In one case in a liraglutide-treated patient, pancreatitis, with necrosis, was observed and led to death; however clinical causality could not be established. Some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, the incidence of cholelithiasis was 0.3% in both liraglutide-treated and placebo-treated patients. The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.2% in both liraglutide-treated and placebo-treated patients. In the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] , the incidence of cholelithiasis was 1.5% (3.9 cases per 1,000 patient years of observation) in adult liraglutide-treated and 1.1% (2.8 cases per 1,000 patient years of observation) in placebo-treated patients, both on a background of standard of care. The incidence of acute cholecystitis was 1.1% (2.9 cases per 1,000 patient years of observation) in adult liraglutide-treated and 0.7% (1.9 cases per 1,000 patient years of observation) in placebo-treated patients. The majority of events required hospitalization or cholecystectomy. Laboratory Tests Bilirubin In the five adult glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration, mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (elevations to no more than twice the upper limit of the reference range) occurred in 4.0% of liraglutide-treated patients, 2.1% of placebo-treated patients and 3.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. This finding was not accompanied by abnormalities in other liver tests. The significance of this isolated finding is unknown. Calcitonin Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program. At the end of the adult glycemic control trials, adjusted mean serum calcitonin concentrations were higher in liraglutide- treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients but not compared to patients receiving active comparator. Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less. Among adult patients with pretreatment calcitonin <20 ng/L, calcitonin elevations to >20 ng/L occurred in 0.7% of liraglutide-treated patients, 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, and 0.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Lipase and Amylase In one adult glycemic control trial in renal impairment patients, a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed for liraglutide-treated patients while placebo-treated patients had a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%. In the LEADER trial, serum lipase and amylase were routinely measured. Among adult liraglutide-treated patients, 7.9% had a lipase value at any time during treatment of greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal compared with 4.5% of placebo-treated patients, and 1% of liraglutide-treated patients had an amylase value at any time during treatment of greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal versus 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with liraglutide injection is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Vital signs Liraglutide injection did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed in adult patients treated with liraglutide injection compared to placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of liraglutide injection. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal: Acute pancreatitis; hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis sometimes resulting in death; ileus, intestinal obstruction, severe constipation including fecal impaction, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea leading to dehydration Hepatobiliary: Elevations of liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy, hepatitis Hypersensitivity: Angioedema, anaphylactic reactions, pruritus Neoplasms: Medullary thyroid carcinoma Neurologic: Dysgeusia, dizziness, dysesthesia Pulmonary: Pulmonary aspiration has occurred in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation. Renal: Acute renal failure or worsening of chronic renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis; and increased serum creatinine Skin and subcutaneous tissue: Cutaneous amyloidosis, alopecia"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Effects of delayed gastric emptying on oral medications : Liraglutide injection delays gastric emptying and may impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications ( 7 ). 7.1 Effects of Delayed Gastric Emptying on Oral Medications Liraglutide injection causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials, liraglutide injection did not affect the absorption of the tested orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with liraglutide injection. 7.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin Liraglutide injection stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. Patients receiving liraglutide injection in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. When initiating liraglutide injection, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Liraglutide injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to liraglutide injection during pregnancy. Liraglutide injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal reproduction studies identified increased adverse developmental outcomes from exposure during pregnancy. Liraglutide exposure was associated with early embryonic deaths and an imbalance in some fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats administered liraglutide during organogenesis at doses that approximate clinical exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.8 mg/day. In pregnant rabbits administered liraglutide during organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of major fetal abnormalities were seen at exposures below the human exposures at the MRHD (see Animal Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects for women with uncontrolled pre-gestational diabetes (Hemoglobin A 1C >7) is 6 to 10%. The major birth defect rate has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a Hemoglobin A 1C >10. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Animal Data Female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide beginning 2 weeks before mating through gestation day 17 had estimated systemic exposures 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times the human exposure at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. The number of early embryonic deaths in the 1 mg/kg/day group increased slightly. Fetal abnormalities and variations in kidneys and blood vessels, irregular ossification of the skull, and a more complete state of ossification occurred at all doses. Mottled liver and minimally kinked ribs occurred at the highest dose. The incidence of fetal malformations in liraglutide-treated groups exceeding concurrent and historical controls were misshapen oropharynx and/or narrowed opening into larynx at 0.1 mg/kg/day and umbilical hernia at 0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg/day. Pregnant rabbits given subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through day 18 inclusive, had estimated systemic exposures less than the human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day at all doses, based on plasma AUC. Liraglutide decreased fetal weight and dose-dependently increased the incidence of total major fetal abnormalities at all doses. The incidence of malformations exceeded concurrent and historical controls at 0.01 mg/kg/day (kidneys, scapula), \u22650.01 mg/kg/day (eyes, forelimb), 0.025 mg/kg/day (brain, tail and sacral vertebrae, major blood vessels and heart, umbilicus), \u22650.025 mg/kg/day (sternum) and at 0.05 mg/kg/day (parietal bones, major blood vessels). Irregular ossification and/or skeletal abnormalities occurred in the skull and jaw, vertebrae and ribs, sternum, pelvis, tail, and scapula; and dose-dependent minor skeletal variations were observed. Visceral abnormalities occurred in blood vessels, lung, liver, and esophagus. Bilobed or bifurcated gallbladder was seen in all treatment groups, but not in the control group. In pregnant female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through weaning or termination of nursing on lactation day 24, estimated systemic exposures were 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day, based on plasma AUC. A slight delay in parturition was observed in the majority of treated rats. Group mean body weight of neonatal rats from liraglutide-treated dams was lower than neonatal rats from control group dams. Bloody scabs and agitated behavior occurred in male rats descended from dams treated with 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide. Group mean body weight from birth to postpartum day 14 trended lower in F 2 generation rats descended from liraglutide-treated rats compared to F 2 generation rats descended from controls, but differences did not reach statistical significance for any group. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of liraglutide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Liraglutide was present in milk of lactating rats (see Data) . Developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liraglutide injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liraglutide injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In lactating rats, liraglutide was present unchanged in milk at concentrations approximately 50% of maternal plasma concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide injection as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older. Use of liraglutide injection for this indication is supported by a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial and a 26-week open-label extension in 134 pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a pediatric pharmacokinetic study, and studies in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.2 )] . The risk of hypoglycemia was higher with liraglutide injection in pediatric patients regardless of insulin and/or metformin use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of liraglutide injection have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the liraglutide injection treatment arms of the glycemic control trials, a total of 832 (19.3%) of the patients were 65 to 74 years of age and 145 (3.4%) were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . In the liraglutide injection treatment arm of the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] , a total of 1738 (37.2%) patients were 65 to 74 years of age, 401 (8.6%) were 75 to 84 years of age, and 17 (0.4%) were 85 years of age or older at baseline. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness for liraglutide injection have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of liraglutide injection is recommended for patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The safety and efficacy of liraglutide injection was evaluated in a 26-week clinical study that included patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . In the liraglutide injection treatment arm of the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] , 1,932 (41.4%) patients had mild renal impairment, 999 (21.4%) patients had moderate renal impairment and 117 (2.5%) patients had severe renal impairment at baseline. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were seen in these patients compared to patients with normal renal function. There is limited experience with liraglutide injection in patients with end stage renal disease. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment There is limited experience in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, liraglutide injection should be used with caution in this patient population. No dose adjustment of liraglutide injection is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Liraglutide injection contains liraglutide, an analog of human GLP-1 and acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Liraglutide is manufactured by synthetic process. The peptide precursor of liraglutide has been manufactured to be 97% homologous to native human GLP-1 by substituting arginine for lysine at position 34. Liraglutide is made by attaching a C-16 fatty acid (palmitic acid) with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26 of the peptide precursor. The molecular formula of liraglutide is C 172 H 265 N 43 O 51 and the molecular weight is 3751.2 Daltons. The structural formula (Figure 1) is: Figure 1. Structural Formula of Liraglutide Liraglutide injection is a sterile, aqueous, clear, colorless or almost colorless solution for subcutaneous use. Each 1 mL of liraglutide injection solution contains 6 mg of liraglutide and the following inactive ingredients: disodium phosphate dihydrate, 1.42 mg; propylene glycol, 14 mg; phenol, 5.5 mg; and water for injection. Liraglutide injection has a pH of approximately 8.15, hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH. Each prefilled pen contains a 3 mL solution of liraglutide injection equivalent to 18 mg liraglutide (free-base, anhydrous). Figure 1"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Liraglutide is an acylated human GLP-1 receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37). GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell- surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5 to 2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-4 and NEP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide injection's pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide injection lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide injection or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide injection 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) liraglutide injection on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2 Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide Injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide injection lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single dose of liraglutide injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide injection causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide injection on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide injection at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide injection, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide injection is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide injection using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide injection in pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide injection compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide injection provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5-6) to severe (Child Pugh score > 9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide injection has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide injection (8 h to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The coadministration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide injection. Atorvastatin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide injection. Acetaminophen Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following coadministration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide injection at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Liraglutide injection lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide injection on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide injection increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide injection delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide injection and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those with liraglutide injection or other liraglutide products. A subset of liraglutide-treated patients (1,104 of 2,501, 44%) in five adult double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] and 102/1,104 (9%) of liraglutide-treated patients developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Of these 102 liraglutide-treated patients, 56 (5%) patients developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 12 (1%) of the liraglutide-treated patients. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-liraglutide antibodies on effectiveness of liraglutide injection. In five double-blind adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of liraglutide-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for liraglutide-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. In the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] , anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 11 out of the 1247 (0.9%) adult liraglutide-treated patients with antibody measurements. Of the 11 adult liraglutide-treated patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies, none were observed to develop neutralizing antibodies to liraglutide, and 5 patients (0.4%) developed cross-reacting antibodies against native GLP-1. In a clinical trial with pediatric patients aged 10 years and older [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] , anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 1 (2%) liraglutide treated patient at week 26 and 5 (9%) liraglutide treated patients at week 53. None of the 5 patients had antibodies cross reactive to native GLP-1 or had neutralizing antibodies. Figure 2"

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Liraglutide is an acylated human GLP-1 receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37). GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell- surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5 to 2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-4 and NEP."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide injection's pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide injection lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide injection or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide injection 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) liraglutide injection on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2 Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide Injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide injection lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single dose of liraglutide injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide injection causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide injection on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide injection at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide injection, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide injection is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide injection using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide injection in pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide injection compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide injection provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5-6) to severe (Child Pugh score > 9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide injection has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide injection (8 h to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The coadministration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide injection. Atorvastatin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide injection. Acetaminophen Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following coadministration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide injection at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Liraglutide injection lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide injection on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide injection increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide injection delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide injection and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

A dose-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in the 1 and the 3 mg/kg/day groups with incidences of 13% and 19% in males and 6% and 20% in females, respectively. C-cell adenomas did not occur in control groups or 0.03 and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. Treatment-related malignant C-cell carcinomas occurred in 3% of females in the 3.0 mg/kg/day group. Thyroid C-cell tumors are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in mice. A treatment-related increase in fibrosarcomas was seen on the dorsal skin and subcutis, the body surface used for drug injection, in males in the 3 mg/kg/day group. These fibrosarcomas were attributed to the high local concentration of drug near the injection site. The liraglutide concentration in the clinical formulation (6 mg/mL) is 10-times higher than the concentration in the formulation used to administer 3 mg/kg/day liraglutide to mice in the carcinogenicity study (0.6 mg/mL). A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0.075, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection with exposures 0.5-, 2- and 8-times the human exposure, respectively, resulting from the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. A treatment-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in males in 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide groups with incidences of 12%, 16%, 42%, and 46% and in all female liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 10%, 27%, 33%, and 56% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. A treatment-related increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in all male liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 2%, 8%, 6%, and 14% and in females at 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day with incidences of 0%, 0%, 4%, and 6% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. Thyroid C-cell carcinomas are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in rats. Studies in mice demonstrated that liraglutide-induced C-cell proliferation was dependent on the GLP-1 receptor and that liraglutide did not cause activation of the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene in thyroid C-cells. Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats is unknown and has not been determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Liraglutide was negative with and without metabolic activation in the Ames test for mutagenicity and in a human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test for clastogenicity. Liraglutide was negative in repeat-dose in vivo micronucleus tests in rats. In rat fertility studies using subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating until gestation day 17. No direct adverse effects on male fertility was observed at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day, a high dose yielding an estimated systemic exposure 11- times the human exposure at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC. In female rats, an increase in early embryonic deaths occurred at 1 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain and food consumption were observed in females at the 1 mg/kg/day dose."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In glycemic control trials in adults, liraglutide injection has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with one or two oral anti-diabetic medications or basal insulin. Liraglutide injection was also studied in a cardiovascular outcomes trial (LEADER trial). In each of the placebo controlled trials, treatment with liraglutide injection produced clinically and statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A 1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo. All liraglutide-treated patients started at 0.6 mg/day. The dose was increased in weekly intervals by 0.6 mg to reach 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg for patients randomized to these higher doses. Liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is not effective for glycemic control and is intended only as a starting dose to reduce gastrointestinal intolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Monotherapy In this 52-week trial, 746 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, or glimepiride 8 mg. Patients who were randomized to glimepiride were initially treated with 2 mg daily for two weeks, increasing to 4 mg daily for another two weeks, and finally increasing to 8 mg daily. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and 1.2 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c compared to glimepiride ( Table 3 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.6% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg treatment group, 6% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg treatment group, and 10.1% in the glimepiride-treatment group. The mean age of participants was 53 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 5 years. Participants were 49.7% male, 77.5% White, 12.6% Black or African American and 35% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.1 kg/m 2 . Table 3.

Randomization occurred after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week initial forced metformin titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin were increased up to 2,000 mg/day. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to metformin resulted in a significant mean HbA 1c reduction relative to placebo add-on to metformin and resulted in a similar mean HbA 1c reduction relative to glimepiride 4 mg add-on to metformin ( Table 4 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 5.4% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin treatment group, 3.3% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + metformin treatment group, 23.8% in the placebo + metformin treatment group, and 3.7% in the glimepiride + metformin treated group. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 7 years. Participants were 58.2% male, 87.1% White and 2.4% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 31.0 kg/m 2 .

Patients were to continue their current treatment on metformin at a stable, pre-trial dose level and dosing frequency. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 6 years. Participants were 52.9% male, 86.6% White, 7.2% Black or African American and 16.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.8 kg/m 2 . The primary endpoint was the change in HbA 1c from baseline to Week 26. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c relative to sitagliptin 100 mg (Table 5). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.1% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg group, 0.5% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg treatment group, and 4.1% in the sitagliptin 100 mg treatment group. From a mean baseline body weight of 94 kg, there was a mean reduction of 2.7 kg for liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, 3.3 kg for liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, and 0.8 kg for sitagliptin 100 mg. Table 5.

Mean HbA 1c for Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who Completed the 26-week Trial and for the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF, intent-to-treat) data at Week 26 Combination Therapy with Metformin and Insulin This 26-week open-label trial enrolled 988 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control (HbA 1c 7% to 10%) on metformin (\u22651,500 mg/day) alone or inadequate glycemic control (HbA 1c 7% to 8.5%) on metformin (\u22651500 mg/day) and a sulfonylurea. Patients who were on metformin and a sulfonylurea discontinued the sulfonylurea then all patients entered a 12-week run-in period during which they received add-on therapy with liraglutide injection titrated to 1.8 mg once-daily. At the end of the run-in period, 498 patients (50%) achieved HbA 1c <7% with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin and continued treatment in a non-randomized, observational arm. Another 167 patients (17%) withdrew from the trial during the run-in period with approximately one-half of these patients doing so because of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The remaining 323 patients with HbA 1c \u22657% (33% of those who entered the run-in period) were randomized to 26 weeks of once-daily insulin detemir administered in the evening as add-on therapy (N=162) or to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin (N=161). The starting dose of insulin detemir was 10 units/day and the mean dose at the end of the 26-week randomized period was 39 units/day. During the 26 week randomized treatment period, the percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 11.2% in the group randomized to continued treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin and 1.2% in the group randomized to add-on therapy with insulin detemir. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 55.7% male, 91.3% White, 5.6% Black or African American and 12.5% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 34 kg/m 2 . Treatment with insulin detemir as add-on to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG compared to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin alone (Table 6). From a mean baseline body weight of 96 kg after randomization, there was a mean reduction of 0.3 kg in the patients who received insulin detemir add-on therapy compared to a mean reduction of 1.1 kg in the patients who continued on unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin alone.

Randomization occurred after a 4-week run-in period consisting of an initial, 2-week, forced-glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 2 weeks. During the titration period, doses of glimepiride were increased to 4 mg/day. The doses of glimepiride could be reduced (at the discretion of the investigator) from 4 mg/day to 3 mg/day or 2 mg/day (minimum) after randomization, in the event of unacceptable hypoglycemia or other adverse events. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 49.4% male, 64.4% White and 2.8% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 29.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride (Table 7). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 3.5% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 17.5% in the placebo + glimepiride treatment group, and 6.9% in the rosiglitazone + glimepiride treatment group.

Randomization took place after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week forced metformin and glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin and glimepiride were to be increased up to 2,000 mg/day and 4 mg/day, respectively. After randomization, patients randomized to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg underwent a 2 week period of titration with liraglutide injection. During the trial, the liraglutide injection and metformin doses were fixed, although glimepiride and insulin glargine doses could be adjusted. Patients titrated glargine twice-weekly during the first 8 weeks of treatment based on self-measured fasting plasma glucose on the day of titration. After Week 8, the frequency of insulin glargine titration was left to the discretion of the investigator, but, at a minimum, the glargine dose was to be revised, if necessary, at Weeks 12 and 18. Only 20% of glargine-treated patients achieved the pre-specified target fasting plasma glucose of \u2264100 mg/dL. Therefore, optimal titration of the insulin glargine dose was not achieved in most patients. The mean age of participants was 58 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 56.5% male, 75.0% White and 3.6% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 30.5 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection as add-on to glimepiride and metformin resulted in a statistically significant mean reduction in HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride and metformin (Table 8). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 0.9% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, 0.4% in the insulin glargine + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, and 11.3% in the placebo + metformin + glimepiride treatment group.

Maximally tolerated doses of background therapy were to remain unchanged for the duration of the trial. Patients randomized to exenatide started on a dose of 5 mcg twice-daily for 4 weeks and then were escalated to 10 mcg twice-daily. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 51.9% male, 91.8% White, 5.4% Black or African American and 12.3% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG relative to exenatide ( Table 9 ). The percentage of patients who discontinued for ineffective therapy was 0.4% in the liraglutide injection treatment group and 0% in the exenatide treatment group. Both treatment groups had a mean decrease from baseline in body weight of approximately 3 kg. Table 9.

Patients underwent a 9 week run-in period (3-week forced dose escalation followed by a 6-week dose maintenance phase) with rosiglitazone (starting at 4 mg and increasing to 8 mg/day within 2 weeks) and metformin (starting at 500 mg with increasing weekly increments of 500 mg to a final dose of 2,000 mg/day). Only patients who tolerated the final dose of rosiglitazone (8 mg/day) and metformin (2000 mg/day) and completed the 6-week dose maintenance phase were eligible for randomization into the trial. The mean age of participants was 55 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 61.6% male, 84.2% White, 10.2% Black or African American and 16.4% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection as add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone produced a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 10). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 1.7% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, 1.7% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group, and 16.4% in the placebo + metformin + rosiglitazone treatment group.

Liraglutide injection was added to the patient's stable pre-trial antidiabetic regimen (insulin therapy and/or metformin, pioglitazone, or sulfonylurea). The dose of liraglutide injection was escalated according to approved labeling to achieve a dose of 1.8 mg per day. The insulin dose was reduced by 20% at randomization for patients with baseline HbA 1c \u2264 8% and fixed until liraglutide dose escalation was complete. Dose reduction of insulin and SU was allowed in case of hypoglycemia; up titration of insulin was allowed but not beyond the pre-trial dose. The mean age of participants was 67 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Participants were 50.5% male, 92.3% White, 6.6% Black or African American, and 7.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 . Approximately half of patients had an eGFR between 30 and <45mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Treatment with liraglutide injection resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c from baseline at Week 26 compared to placebo (see Table 11 ). 123 patients reached the 1.8 mg dose of liraglutide injection.

Patients were randomized to liraglutide injection once-daily or placebo once-daily in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin treatment. All patients were on a metformin dose of 1000 to 2000 mg prior to randomization. The basal insulin dose was decreased by 20% at randomization and liraglutide injection was titrated weekly by 0.6 mg for 2 to 3 weeks based on tolerability and an average fasting plasma glucose goal of \u2264110 mg/dL. The mean age was 14.6 years: 29.9% were ages 10-14 years, and 70.1% were greater than 14 years of age. 38.1% were male, 64.9% were White, 13.4% were Asian, 11.9% were Black or African American; 29.1% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m 2 and the mean BMI SDS was 2.9. 18.7% of patients were using basal insulin at baseline. The mean duration of diabetes was 1.9 years and the mean HbA 1c was 7.8%. At week 26, treatment with liraglutide injection was superior in reducing HbA 1c from baseline versus placebo. The estimated treatment difference in HbA 1c reduction from baseline between liraglutide injection and placebo was -1.06% with a 95% confidence interval of [-1.65%; -0.46%] ( see Table 12 ).

Missing observations (10.6% in the liraglutide injection, 14.5% in the placebo) were imputed from the placebo arm based on multiple (x10,000) imputations. The data for week 26 was then analyzed with an ANCOVA model containing treatment, sex and age group as fixed effects and baseline value as covariate. b Categories are derived from continuous measurements of HbA 1c using a pattern mixture model with multiple imputation for missing observations. * p-value <0.001 14.3 Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease The LEADER trial (NCT01179048) was a multi-national, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. In this study, 9,340 adult patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg or placebo for a median duration of 3.5 years. The study compared the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events between liraglutide injection and placebo when these were added to, and used concomitantly with, background standard of care treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary endpoint, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), was the time to first occurrence of a three part composite outcome which included; cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke. Patients eligible to enter the trial were; 50 years of age or older and had established, stable, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II and III heart failure (80% of the enrolled population) or were 60 years of age or older and had other specified risk factors for cardiovascular disease (20% of the enrolled population). At baseline, demographic and disease characteristics were balanced. The mean age was 64 years and the population was 64.3% male, 77.5% White, 10.0% Asian, and 8.3% Black or African American. In the study, 12.1% of the population identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 12.8 years, the mean HbA 1c was 8.7% and the mean BMI was 32.5 kg/m 2 . A history of previous myocardial infarction was reported in 31% of randomized individuals, a prior revascularization procedure in 39%, a prior ischemic stroke in 11%, documented symptomatic coronary disease in 9%, documented asymptomatic cardiac ischemia in 26%, and a diagnosis of NYHA class II to III heart failure in 14%. The mean eGFR at baseline was 79 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and 41.8% of patients had mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), 20.7% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) and 2.4% of patients had severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). At baseline, patients treated their diabetes with; diet and exercise only (3.9%), oral antidiabetic drugs only (51.5%), oral antidiabetic drugs and insulin (36.7%) or insulin only (7.9%). The most common background antidiabetic drugs used at baseline and in the trial were metformin, sulfonylurea and insulin. Use of DPP-4 inhibitors and other GLP-1 receptor agonists was excluded by protocol and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors were either not approved or not widely available. At baseline, cardiovascular disease and risk factors were managed with; non-diuretic antihypertensives (92.4%), diuretics (41.8%), statin therapy (72.1%) and platelet aggregation inhibitors (66.8%). During the trial, investigators could modify anti-diabetic and cardiovascular medications to achieve local standard of care treatment targets with respect to blood glucose, lipid, and blood pressure, and manage patients recovering from an acute coronary syndrome or stroke event per local treatment guidelines. For the primary analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for non-inferiority against the pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE and to test for superiority on MACE if non-inferiority was demonstrated. Type 1 error was controlled across multiple tests. Liraglutide injection significantly reduced the occurrence of MACE. The estimated hazard ratio (95% CI) for time to first MACE was 0.87 (0.78, 0.97). Refer to Figure 5 and Table 13 . Vital status was available for 99.7% of subjects in the trial. A total of 828 deaths were recorded during the LEADER trial. A majority of the deaths in the trial were categorized as cardiovascular deaths and non-cardiovascular deaths were balanced between the treatment groups (3.5% in patients treated with liraglutide injection and 3.6% in patients treated with placebo). The estimated hazard ratio of time to all-cause death for liraglutide injection compared to placebo was 0.85 (0.74, 0.97). Figure 5.

      "Instructions for Use Liraglutide Injection First read the Medication Guide that comes with your liraglutide injection single-patient use pen and then read this Instructions for Use for information about how to use your liraglutide injection pen the right way. These instructions do not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Do not share your Liraglutide Injection Pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. Your liraglutide injection pen is a disposable single-patient-use prefilled pen injector that contains 3 mL of liraglutide and will deliver doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg.

Your healthcare provider will tell you how much liraglutide injection to take. Talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist for more information about needles for your liraglutide injection pen. Important Information \u00b7 Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \u00b7 Always remove the needle after each injection, and store your pen without the needle attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of liraglutide, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. \u00b7 Keep your liraglutide injection pen and all medicines out of the reach of children. \u00b7 If you drop your liraglutide injection pen, repeat \" First Time Use for Each New Pen \" (steps A through D). \u00b7 Be careful not to bend or damage the needle. \u00b7 Do not use the cartridge scale to measure how much liraglutide injection to inject. \u00b7 Be careful when handling used needles to avoid needle stick injuries. \u00b7 You can use your liraglutide injection pen for up to 30 days after you use it the first time. Supplies you will need to give your liraglutide injection: \u00b7 Liraglutide injection pen \u00b7 a new disposable needle \u00b7 alcohol swab \u00b7 cotton ball or gauze \u00b7 sharps disposal container for throwing away used liraglutide injection pens and needles. See \"Remove and Dispose of the Needle\" at the end of these instructions. First Time Use for Each New Pen Step A. Check the Pen Take your new liraglutide injection pen out of the refrigerator. Wash hands with soap and water before use. Check pen label before each use to make sure it is your liraglutide injection pen. Pull off pen cap (See Figure A).

Attach the Needle Remove protective tab from outer needle cap. Push outer needle cap containing the needle straight onto the pen, then screw needle on until secure. (See Figure B ). Pull off outer needle cap. (See Figure C ). Do not throw away Pull off inner needle cap and throw away. (See Figure D ). A small drop of liquid may appear. This is normal. Step C. Dial to the Flow Check Symbol This step is done only One Time for each new pen and is Only required the first time you use a new pen. Turn dose selector until flow check symbol lines up with pointer (See Figure E ). The flow check symbol does not administer the dose as prescribed by your healthcare provider. To select the dose prescribed by your healthcare provider, continue to Step G under \" Routine Use \". Step D. Prepare the Pen Hold pen with needle pointing up. Tap cartridge gently with your finger a few times to bring any air bubbles to the top of the cartridge (See Figure F ). Keep needle pointing up and press dose button until the black line indicating 0 mg lines up with pointer (See Figure G ). Repeat steps C and D , up to 6 times, until a drop of liraglutide injection appears at the needle tip. If you still see no drop of liraglutide injection, use a new pen and contact Orbicular Pharmaceutical Technologies Private Limited at 1-888-370-4186. Continue to Step G under \"Routine Use\" \u2192 Routine Use Step E. Check the Pen Take your liraglutide injection pen from where it is stored. Wash hands with soap and water before use. Check pen label before each use to make sure it is your liraglutide injection pen. Pull off pen cap (See Figure H ). Check liraglutide injection in the cartridge. The liquid should be clear, colorless and free of particles. If not, do not use. Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab. Step F. Attach the Needle Remove protective tab from outer needle cap.

Dial the Dose Liraglutide injection pen can give a dose of 0.6 mg (starting dose), 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg. Be sure that you know the dose of liraglutide injection that is prescribed for you. Turn the dose selector until the black line indicating your needed dose lines up with the pointer (0.6 mg, 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg) (See Figure L ). You will hear a \"click\" every time you turn the dose selector. Do not set the dose by counting the number of clicks you hear. If you select a wrong dose, change it by turning the dose selector backwards or forwards until the black line indicating the correct dose lines up with the pointer. Be careful not to press the dose button when turning the dose selector. This may cause liraglutide injection to come out. Step H. Injecting the Dose Choose your injection site in either the stomach (abdomen), thigh, or upper arm (only if caregiver administered) and wipe the skin with an alcohol swab (See Figure M ). Let the injection site dry before you inject your dose. Insert needle into your skin using the injection technique shown to you by your healthcare provider. Do not inject liraglutide injection into a vein or muscle. Press down on the center of the dose button to inject until the black line indicating 0 mg lines up with the pointer (See Figure N ). Be careful not to touch the dose display with your other fingers. This may block the injection. Keep the dose button pressed down and make sure that you keep the needle under the skin for a full count of 6 seconds to make sure the full dose is injected. Keep your thumb on the injection button until you remove the needle from your skin (See Figure O ). Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Step I. Withdraw Needle You may see a drop of liraglutide injection at the needle tip.

Remove and Dispose of the Needle Carefully put the outer needle cap over the needle (See Figure Q ). Unscrew the needle. Safely remove the needle from your liraglutide injection pen after each use. Put your used liraglutide injection pen and needles in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and pens in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out upright and stable during use leak-resistant properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. Do not reuse or share your needles with other people. For more information about the safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. Caring for your liraglutide injection pen After removing the needle, put the pen cap on your liraglutide injection pen and store your liraglutide injection pen without the needle attached (See Figure R ). Do not try to refill your liraglutide injection pen - it is prefilled and is disposable. Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart. Keep your liraglutide injection pen away from dust, dirt and liquids. If cleaning is needed, wipe the outside of the pen with a clean, damp cloth. How should I store liraglutide injection? Before use: Store your new, unused liraglutide injection pen in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C). If liraglutide injection is stored outside of refrigeration (by mistake) prior to first use, it should be used or thrown away within 30 days. Do not freeze liraglutide injection or use liraglutide injection if it has been frozen. Do not store liraglutide injection near the refrigerator cooling element. Pen in use: Use a liraglutide injection pen for only 30 days. Throw away a used liraglutide injection pen 30 days after you start using it, even if some medicine is left in the pen. Store your liraglutide injection pen at room temperature 59\u00b0 to 86\u00b0F (15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C), or in a refrigerator between 36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C). When carrying the pen away from home, store the pen at room temperature between 59\u00b0 to 86\u00b0F (15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C). If liraglutide injection has been exposed to temperatures above 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C), it should be thrown away. Protect your liraglutide injection pen from heat and sunlight.
