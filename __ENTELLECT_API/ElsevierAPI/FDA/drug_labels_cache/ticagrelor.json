      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ticagrelor is a P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of myocardial infarction (MI). For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS. ( 1.1 ) to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). ( 1.2 ) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )]."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ACS or History of MI Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI Administer 60 mg ticagrelor tablets twice daily. ( 2.3 ) Acute Ischemic Stroke Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. ( 2.4 ) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 to 100 mg. ( 2 ) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versusbleeding events. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablets, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) and Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Use ticagrelor tablets with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) \u2022Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) \u2022Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor tablets in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor Tablets in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor tablets must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor tablets for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor tablets as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor tablets, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor tablets without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor tablets can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1- Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

PLATO Major bleed : any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 grams/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 grams/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. * 90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other haemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Figure 4 -Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe : Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (eg, systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3,000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%,1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment.

( 7.4 ) \u2022 Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) \u2022 Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin , Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen.When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA\u00ae (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

Treatment of overdose should follow local standard medical practice. Bleeding is the expected pharmacologic effect of overdosing. If bleeding occurs, appropriate supportive measures should be taken. Platelet transfusion did not reverse the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor tablets in healthy volunteers and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding. Other effects of overdose may include gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) or ventricular pauses. Monitor the ECG."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Figure5 -Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (\u00b1SE) following single oral doses of placebo, 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel Figure 6 - Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA ) following 6 weeks on placebo, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily \u2022 Ticagrelor \u25b2Clopidogrel \u25a0 Placebo Transitioning from clopidogrel to ticagrelor resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from ticagrelor to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1 to 4). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1 hour (range 1 to 4) for ticagrelor and 2 hours (range 1 to 8) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 - Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor * Single dose of ticagrelor administered on a day without dialysis. ** Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 - Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9333) to clopidogrel (N=9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO.

Figure 10 - Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke in (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91; p=0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 - Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (U.S. and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the U.S. subset. The statistical test for the U.S./non-U.S. comparison is statistically significant ( p =0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p -values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the U.S. and non-U.S. (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in U.S. sites from sites outside of the U.S. About 8% of non-U.S. investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the U.S., 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the U.S. and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 - CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the U.S. and outside the U.S. (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, nonfatal MI or non-fatal stroke. F igure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14. Figure Figure14 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 60 mg (PEGASUS ) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified.

Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. 14.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction THEMIS The THEMIS study (NCT01991795) was a double-blind, parallel group, study in which 19,220 patients with CAD and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) but no history of MI or stroke were randomized to twice daily ticagrelor or placebo, on a background of 75 to 150 mg of aspirin. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the U.S. was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9. Table 9 \u2013 Primary composite endpoint, primary endpoint components, and secondary endpoints (THEMIS) Ticagrelor N=9619 Placebo N=9601 HR (95% CI) p -value Events / 1,000 patient years Events / 1,000 patient years Time to first CV death, MI, or stroke * 24 27 0.90 (0.81, 0.99) 0.04 CV death \u2020 12 11 1.02 (0.88, 1.18) Myocardial infarction \u2020 9 11 0.84 (0.71, 0.98) Stroke \u2020 6 7 0.82 (0.67, 0.99) Secondary endpoints CV death 12 11 1.02 (0.88, 1.18) Myocardial infarction 9 11 0.84 (0.71, 0.98) Ischemic stroke 5 6 0.80 (0.64, 0.99) All-cause death 18 19 0.98 (0.87, 1.10) CI = Confidence interval; CV = Cardiovascular; HR = Hazard ratio; MI = Myocardial infarction. * Primary endpoint \u2020 The event rate for the components CV death, MI and stroke are calculated from the actual number of first events for each component.

Figure 15 -Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (THEMIS) T = Ticagrelor; P = Placebo; N = Number of patients. The treatment effect of ticagrelor appeared similar across patient subgroups, see Figure 16. Figure 16 \u2013Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor (THEMIS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD 2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 to 325 mg then 75 to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10 -Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5523 Placebo N=5493 HR (95% CI) p -value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke* 284 5.1% 347 6.3% 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) Time to Death* 36 0.6% 27 0.5% 1.33 (0.81, 2.19) Secondary Endpoint Time to first Ischemic Stroke 276 5.0% 345 6.2% 0.79 (0.68, 0.93) 0.004 CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier percentage calculated at 30 days; N = Number of patients * The number of patients with the event of interest. In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor\u2019s treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%)."

      "MEDICATION GUIDE Ticagrelor (tye ka\u02b9 grel or) Tablets What is the most important information I should know about ticagrelor tablets? Ticagrelor tablets are used to lower your chance of having, or dying from, a heart attack or stroke. Ticagrelor tablets (and similar drugs) can cause bleeding that can be serious and sometimes lead to death. In cases of serious bleeding, such as internal bleeding, the bleeding may result in the need for blood transfusions or surgery. While you take ticagrelor tablets: you may bruise and bleed more easily you are more likely to have nose bleeds it will take longer than usual for any bleeding to stop Call your healthcare provider right away, if you have any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding while taking ticagrelor tablets: bleeding that is severe or that you cannot control pink, red or brown urine vomiting blood or your vomit looks like \u201ccoffee grounds\u201d red or black stools (looks like tar) coughing up blood or blood clots D o not stop taking ticagrelor tablets without talking to the healthcare provider who prescribes it for you. People who are treated with a stent, and stop taking ticagrelor tablets too soon, have a higher risk of getting a blood clot in the stent, having a heart attack, or dying. If you stop ticagrelor tablets because of bleeding, or for other reasons, your risk of a heart attack or stroke may increase. Your healthcare provider may instruct you to stop taking ticagrelor tablets 5 days before surgery. This will help to decrease your risk of bleeding with your surgery or procedure. Your healthcare provider should tell you when to start taking ticagrelor tablets again, as soon as possible after surgery. Taking ticagrelor tablets with aspirin Ticagrelor tablets are taken with aspirin unless your healthcare provider specifically tells you otherwise. Talk to your healthcare provider about the dose of aspirin that you should take with ticagrelor tablets. In most cases, you should not take a dose of aspirin higher than 100 mg daily. Do not take doses of aspirin higher than what your healthcare provider tells you to take.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the postmarketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 \u2013 Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days. Table 1 - Non-CABG related bleeds (PLATO) Ticagrelor * Clopidogrel N=9,235 N=9,186 n (%) patients with event n (%) patients with event PLATO Major + Minor 713 (7.7) 567 (6.2) Major 362 (3.9) 306 (3.3) Fatal/Life-threatening 171 (1.9) 151 (1.6) Fatal 15 (0.2) 16 (0.2) Intracranial hemorrhage (Fatal/Life-threatening) 26 (0.3) 15 (0.2) PLATO Minor bleed: requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding. PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. * 90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Figure 4 - Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe : Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages <10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. new1 new2 new3 new4 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications ( 4.3 )] . Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, coadministration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring coadministration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD ( see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in an adequate and well-controlled study conducted in 101 ticagrelor-treated pediatric patients, aged 2 to <18 for reducing the rate of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . new5 new6 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1.0 to 4.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80% to 125% for ticagrelor and AR\u00ad-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 to 4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 to 8.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30% to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 - Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor * Single dose of ticagrelor administered on a day without dialysis. ** Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Coadministration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine coadministration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients coadministered with morphine. Coadministration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9,333) to clopidogrel (N=9,291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 mg to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint.

The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10 - Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91; p =0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 - Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant ( p =0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p -values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 \u2013 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, coadministered with 75 mg to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14. Figure 14 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 60 mg (PEGASUS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u226550% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

Figure 15 - Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (THEMIS) T = Ticagrelor; P = Placebo; N = Number of patients. The treatment effect of ticagrelor appeared similar across patient subgroups, see Figure 16. Figure 16 \u2013Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor (THEMIS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics.

Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. new15 new16 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD 2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 mg to 325 mg then 75 mg to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10 - Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5,523 Placebo N=5,493 HR (95% CI) p -value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke * 284 5.1% 347 6.3% 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) Time to Death * 36 0.6% 27 0.5% 1.33 (0.81, 2.19) Secondary Endpoint Time to first Ischemic Stroke 276 5.0% 345 6.2% 0.79 (0.68, 0.93) 0.004 CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier percentage calculated at 30 days; N = Number of patients * The number of patients with the event of interest. In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor\u2019s treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). new17 new18"

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ticagrelor tablets are a P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS. (1.1) to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets were established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). (1.2) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). (1.3) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets were established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ACS or History of MI Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. (2.2 ) Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI Administer 60 mg ticagrelor tablets twice daily. (2.3 ) Acute Ischemic Stroke Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. (2.4) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 to 100 mg. (2 ) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH 8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablets, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Clinical Studies (14)]. 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Use ticagrelor tablets with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ]."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor tablets than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor tablets is self-limiting. (5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. (5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. (5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor tablets increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor tablets in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor Tablets in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor tablets must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor tablets for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor tablets as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor tablets developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor tablets, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor tablets without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor tablets can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor tablets have been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor tablets are required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. (5.1, 5.3, 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. * 90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 'Major fatal/life-threatening' CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Figure 4 - Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe : Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages <10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (eg, systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3,000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor tablets. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications (4.3) ]. Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. (7.1, 7.2) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. (7.3) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. (7.4) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor tablets. (7.5) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor tablets increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Ticagrelor tablets increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor tablets inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD (see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA \u00ae (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor tablets did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 mcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 mcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Figure 5 \u2013 Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (\u00b1SE) following single oral doses of placebo, 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel Figure 6 \u2013 Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) following 6 weeks on placebo, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily \u2022Ticagrelor \u25b2 Clopidogrel \u25a0 Placebo Transitioning from clopidogrel to ticagrelor resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from ticagrelor to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1 to 4). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor tablets as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1 hour (range 1 to 4) for ticagrelor and 2 hours (range 1 to 8) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor Tablets CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9,333) to clopidogrel (N=9,291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality. Table 7 \u2013 Patients with outcome events (PLATO) Ticagrelor * N=9,333 Clopidogrel N=9,291 Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value Events / 1,000 patient years Events / 1,000 patient years Composite of CV death, MI, or stroke 111 131 0.84 (0.77, 0.92) 0.0003 CV death 32 43 0.74 Non-fatal MI 64 76 0.84 Non-fatal stroke 15 12 1.24 Secondary endpoints \u2020 CV death 45 57 0.79 (0.69, 0.91) 0.0013 MI \u2021 65 76 0.84 (0.75, 0.95) 0.0045 Stroke \u2021 16 14 1.17 (0.91, 1.52) 0.22 All-cause mortality 51 65 0.78 (0.69, 0.89) 0.0003 *Dosed at 90 mg bid. \u2020 Note: rates of first events for the components CV Death, MI and Stroke are the actual rates for first events for each component and do not add up to the overall rate of events in the composite endpoint. \u2021 Including patients who could have had other non-fatal events or died. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non- fatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10 \u2013 Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91; p=0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant (p=0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 \u2013 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non- fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14. Figure 14 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 60 mg (PEGASUS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. 14.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction THEMIS The THEMIS study (NCT01991795) was a double-blind, parallel group, study in which 19,220 patients with CAD and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) but no history of MI or stroke were randomized to twice daily ticagrelor or placebo, on a background of 75 to 150 mg of aspirin. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u226550% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

Figure 15 - Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (THEMIS) T = Ticagrelor; P = Placebo; N = Number of patients. The treatment effect of ticagrelor appeared similar across patient subgroups, see Figure 16. Figure 16 \u2013Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor (THEMIS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD 2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 to 325 mg then 75 to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10 - Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5,523 Placebo N=5,493 HR (95% CI) p-value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke * 284 5.1% 347 6.3% 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) Time to Death * 36 0.6% 27 0.5% 1.33 (0.81, 2.19) Secondary Endpoint Time to first Ischemic Stroke 276 5.0% 345 6.2% 0.79 (0.68, 0.93) 0.004 CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier percentage calculated at 30 days; N = Number of patients *The number of patients with the event of interest. In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%)."

( 5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor tablets increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor Tablets in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor tablets must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor tablets for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor tablets as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) of patients treated with ticagrelor tablets developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), and 4.3% (PEGASUS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor tablets, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor tablets without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor tablets patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor tablets have been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y12-receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor tablets are required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor tablets interference, ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Most common adverse reactions (greater than 5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-272-7901 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days. Table 1 \u2013 Non-CABG related bleeds (PLATO) Ticagrelor Tablets* N=9,235 Clopidogrel N=9,186 n (%) patients with event n (%) patients with event PLATO Major + Minor 713 (7.7) 567 (6.2) Major 362 (3.9) 306 (3.3) Fatal/Life-threatening 171 (1.9) 151 (1.6) Fatal 15 (0.2) 16 (0.2) Intracranial hemorrhage (Fatal/Life-threatening) 26 (0.3) 15 (0.2) PLATO Minor bleed: requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding. PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. * 90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor tablets compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 - \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. TIMI Minor: Clinically apparent with 3 to 5 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin. *60 mg BID The bleeding profile of ticagrelor tablets 60 mg compared to aspirin alone was consistent across multiple pre-defined subgroups (e.g., by age, gender, weight, race, geographic region, concurrent conditions, concomitant therapy, stent, and medical history) for TIMI Major and TIMI Major or Minor bleeding events. Other Adverse Reactions in PEGASUS Adverse reactions that occurred in PEGASUS at rates of 3% or more are shown in Table 5. Table 5 \u2013 Non-hemorrhagic adverse reactions reported in greater than 3.0% of patients in the ticagrelor 60 mg treatment group (PEGASUS) Ticagrelor Tablets * N=6,958 Placebo N=6,996 Dyspnea 14.2% 5.5% Dizziness 4.5% 4.1% Diarrhea 3.3% 2.5% * 60 mg BID Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3,000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor tablets (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO and PEGASUS excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor tablets 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor tablets 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor tablets than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a greater than 50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor tablets 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by greater than 50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor tablets 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. ticagrelor-fig001 ticagrelor-fig002 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor tablets. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (less than 2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [ see Contraindications ( 4.3 ) ]. Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor tablets. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor tablets increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Ticagrelor tablets increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor tablets inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor tablets therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA \u00ae (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO and PEGASUS were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor tablets did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO and PEGASUS."

When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis)."

Treatment of overdose should follow local standard medical practice. Bleeding is the expected pharmacologic effect of overdosing. If bleeding occurs, appropriate supportive measures should be taken. Platelet transfusion did not reverse the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor in healthy volunteers and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding. Other effects of overdose may include gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) or ventricular pauses. Monitor the ECG."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6 -week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 mcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 mcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor tablets without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . fig-5 ticagrelor-06 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1.0 to 4.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor tablets as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 to 4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 to 8.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor tablets 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor tablets were administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor tablets are not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor tablets were independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration (2) Effects of Ticagrelor Tablets on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor tablets (N=9,333) to clopidogrel (N=9,291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor tablets received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were greater than 65 years and 15% were greater than 75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

Figure 10 \u2013 Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91; p =0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant ( p =0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p -values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs . planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor tablets when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 \u2013 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, nonfatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor tablets in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor tablets plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor tablets 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14. Figure 14 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 60 mg (PEGASUS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Fig-10 ticagrelor-fig011 ticagrelor-fig12 ticagrlor-im013 ticagrelor-fig014"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ACS or History of MI Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI Administer 60 mg ticagrelor tablets twice daily. ( 2.3 ) Acute Ischemic Stroke Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. ( 2.4 ) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 to 100 mg. ( 2 ) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablets, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Use ticagrelor tablets with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] ."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor tablets than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor tablets are self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT.( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor tablets increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS greater than 5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor tablets in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor Tablets in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor tablets must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor tablets for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor tablets as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor tablets developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor tablets, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor tablets without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor tablets patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor tablets have been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor tablets are required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor tablets interference, ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \u00b7 Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u00b7 Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Most common adverse reactions (greater than 5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-272-7901 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. * 90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor tablets compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Figure 4 -Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe : Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages less than 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor tablets and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor tablets and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3,000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor tablets (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor tablets 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor tablets 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor tablets than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a greater than 50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor tablets 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by greater than 50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor tablets 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. ticagrelor-fig1 ticagrelor-fig2 ticagrelor-fig3-a ticagrelor-fig4 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor tablets. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (less than 2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [ see Contraindications ( 4.3 ) ]. Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor tablets. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor tablets increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Ticagrelor tablets increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor tablets inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor tablets therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA \u00ae (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor tablets did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6 -week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Figure 5 \u2013 Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (\u00b1SE) following single oral doses of placebo, 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel Figure 6 \u2013 Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) following 6 weeks on placebo, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily Transitioning from clopidogrel to ticagrelor tablets resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from ticagrelor tablets to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor tablets without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . ticagrelor-fig5 ticagrelor-fig6 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1.0 to 4.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor tablets as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 to 4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 to 8.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and Cmax of ticagrelor tablets 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor tablets were administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor tablets are not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor tablets were independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. Tmax was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration(2) Effects of Ticagrelor Tablets on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and Cmax of ticagrelor tablets 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor tablets were administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor tablets are not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor tablets were independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. Tmax was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration(2) Effects of Ticagrelor Tablets on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor tablets (N=9,333) to clopidogrel (N=9,291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor tablets received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were greater than 65 years and 15% were greater than 75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality. Table 7 \u2013 Patients with outcome events (PLATO) Ticagrelor Tablets * N=9,333 Clopidogrel N=9,291 Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p -value Events / 1,000 patient years Events / 1,000 patient years Composite of CV death, MI, or stroke 111 131 0.84 (0.77, 0.92) 0.0003 CV death 32 43 0.74 Non-fatal MI 64 76 0.84 Non-fatal stroke 15 12 1.24 Secondary endpoints \u2020 CV death 45 57 0.79 (0.69, 0.91) 0.0013 MI \u2021 65 76 0.84 (0.75, 0.95) 0.0045 Stroke \u2021 16 14 1.17 (0.91, 1.52) 0.22 All-cause mortality 51 65 0.78 (0.69, 0.89) 0.0003 *Dosed at 90 mg bid. \u2020Note: rates of first events for the components CV Death, MI and Stroke are the actual rates for first events for each component and do not add up to the overall rate of events in the composite endpoint. \u2021Including patients who could have had other non-fatal events or died. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, nonfatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10 \u2013 Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91; p =0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant ( p =0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p -values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs . planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor tablets when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 \u2013 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, nonfatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor tablets in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor tablets plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor tablets 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor tablets were superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. ticagrelor-fig15 ticagrelor-fig16 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor tablets 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD 2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor tablets (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 to 325 mg then 75 to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor tablets were superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR).

Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor tablets were generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified.

Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). ticagrelor-fig17 ticagrelor-fig18"

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ticagrelor is a P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS. ( 1.1 ) to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of Ticagrelor was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). ( 1.2 ) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets were established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor tablet is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )]."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 ACS or History of MI o Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI o Administer 60 mg ticagrelor twice daily. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Acute Ischemic Stroke o Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. ( 2.4 ) Use ticagrelor tablet with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg. ( 2 ) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablets, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose . Use ticagrelor tablets with a loading dose of aspirin (300 to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 to 100 mg [See Clinical Studies ( 14 )]."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor tablets than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor tablets is self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor tablets is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor tablets increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor tablets in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor tablets must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor tablets for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor tablets as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor tablets developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor tablets, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor tablets without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor tablets can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor tablets patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor tablets has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y12-receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor tablets are required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor tablets interference, ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

Ticagrelor tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 \u2013 Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. * 90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor tablets compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Figure 4 - Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe: Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor tablets and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor tablets and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor tablets (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor tablets, 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor tablets, 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor tablets than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor tablets 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor tablets 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. ticagrelor-figure-1.jpg ticagrelor-figure-2.jpg ticagrelor-figure-3.jpg ticagrelor-figure-4.jpg 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor tablets. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications ( 4.3 )]. Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor tablets. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor tablets increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Ticagrelor tablets increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor tablets inhibit the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor tablets therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA\u00ae (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor tablets did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Figure 5 \u2013 Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (\u00b1SE) following single oral doses of placebo, 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel Figure 6 \u2013 Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) following 6 weeks on placebo, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily Transitioning from clopidogrel to ticagrelor tablets resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from ticagrelor tablets to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor tablets without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. ticagrelor-figure-5.jpg ticagrelor-figure-6.jpg 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1.0\u20134.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5-5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30%-42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor tablets as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80-125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 \u2013 4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 \u20138.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30-40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor tablets 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor tablets was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor tablets is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor tablets was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor Tablets CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1-2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration (2) Effects of Ticagrelor Tablets on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter.

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1.0\u20134.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5-5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30%-42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor tablets as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80-125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 \u2013 4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 \u20138.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30-40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor tablets 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor tablets was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor tablets is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor tablets was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor Tablets CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1-2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor tablets (N=9333) to clopidogrel (N=9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor tablets received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75-100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, nonfatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10 \u2013 Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91; p=0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant (p=0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor tablets when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 \u2013 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75-150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor tablets in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor tablets plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300-325 mg then 75-100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR).

Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). ticagrelor-figure-17.jpg ticagrelor-figure-18.jpg"

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ticagrelor tablet is a P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduce the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS. (1.1) to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). (1.2) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). (1.3) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduce the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets were established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ACS or History of MI Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI Administer 60 mg ticagrelor tablets twice daily. ( 2.3 ) Acute Ischemic Stroke Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. ( 2.4 ) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg. (2 ) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablets, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Use ticagrelor tablets with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ] ."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor tablets than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor tablets is self-limiting. (5.3) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. (5.5) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. (5.7) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor tablets increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor tablets in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor Tablets in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor tablets must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor tablets for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor tablets as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor tablets developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor tablets, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor tablets without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor tablets can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor tablets patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor tablets have been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor tablets is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor tablets interference, ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. (5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Oryza Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-637-4281 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days. Table 1 - Non-CABG related bleeds (PLATO) Ticagrelor 90 mg BID N=9235 Clopidogrel N=9186 n (%) patients with event n (%) patients with event PLATO Major + Minor 713 (7.7) 567 (6.2) Major 362 (3.9) 306 (3.3) Fatal/Life-threatening 171 (1.9) 151 (1.6) Fatal 15 (0.2) 16 (0.2) Intracranial hemorrhage (Fatal/Life-threatening) 26 (0.3) 15 (0.2) PLATO Minor bleed: requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding. PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor tablets compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 - \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening : any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. When antiplatelet therapy was stopped 5 days before CABG, major bleeding occurred in 75% of ticagrelor tablets treated patients and 79% on clopidogrel. Other Adverse Reactions in PLATO Adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of 4% or more in PLATO are shown in Table 3. Table 3 - Percentage of patients reporting non-hemorrhagic adverse reactions at least 4% or more in either group and more frequently on ticagrelor tablets (PLATO) Ticagrelor 90 mg BID N=9235 Clopidogrel N=9186 Dyspnea 13.8 7.8 Dizziness 4.5 3.9 Nausea 4.3 3.8 Bleeding in PEGASUS (Secondary Prevention in Patients with a History of Myocardial Infarction) Overall outcome of bleeding events in the PEGASUS study are shown in Table 4.

Figure 4 \u2013 Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe: Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor tablets and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor tablets and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor tablets (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor tablets 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor tablets 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor tablets than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor tablets 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor tablets 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. figure_1 fiigure_2 figure_3 figure_4 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor tablets. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. (7.1 , 7.2) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor tablets. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA\u00ae (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor tablets did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1.0\u20134.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5-5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30%-42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80-125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 \u2013 4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 \u20138.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30-40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor tablets 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor tablets was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor tablets is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor tablets was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 - Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1-2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 - Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor * See Dosage and Administration (2) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity.

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9333) to clopidogrel (N=9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor tablets received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75-100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

Figure 10 - Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12\u2011month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91; p=0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant ( p =0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 \u2013 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75-150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor tablets in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor tablets plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs . aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor tablets 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor tablets were superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

Figure 15 - Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (THEMIS) T = Ticagrelor; P = Placebo; N = Number of patients. The treatment effect of ticagrelor tablets appeared similar across patient subgroups, see Figure 16. Figure 16 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor (THEMIS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. figure_15 figure_16 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor tablets 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor tablets (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300-325 mg then 75-100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor tablets were superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR).

Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor tablets was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 - Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). figure_17 figure_18"

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ticagrelor tablets are a P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS. ( 1.1 ) to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). ( 1.2 ) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ACS or History of MI Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI Administer 60 mg ticagrelor tablets twice daily. ( 2.3 ) Acute Ischemic Stroke Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. ( 2.4 ) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 to 100 mg. ( 2 ) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Administerthe first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablets, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ]. 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets and then continuewith 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Use ticagrelor tablets with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. *90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Figure 4 -Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe: Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3,000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES, excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. tica-tabs-fig-04 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications ( 4.3 )]. Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in an adequate and well-controlled study conducted in 101 ticagrelor-treated pediatric patients, aged 2 to <18 for reducing the rate of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 mcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 mcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Figure 5 - Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (\u00b1SE) following single oral doses of placebo, 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel Figure 6 - Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) following 6 weeks on placebo, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily Transitioning from clopidogrel to ticagrelor resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from ticagrelor to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. tica-tabs-fig-05 tica-tabs-fig-06 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1 to 4). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR\u00adC124910XX) with a median t max of 1 hour (range 1 to 4) for ticagrelor and 2 hours (range 1 to 8) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and Cmax of ticagrelor, 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 - Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 - Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter . In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-\u00adC124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 mcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 mcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1 to 4). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR\u00adC124910XX) with a median t max of 1 hour (range 1 to 4) for ticagrelor and 2 hours (range 1 to 8) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and Cmax of ticagrelor, 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 - Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 - Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter . In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-\u00adC124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9,333) to clopidogrel (N=9,291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality. Table 7 - Patients with outcome events (PLATO) Ticagrelor * N=9,333 Clopidogrel N=9,291 Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p -value Events / 1,000 patient years Events / 1,000 patient years Composite of CV death, MI, or stroke 111 131 0.84 (0.77, 0.92) 0.0003 CV death 32 43 0.74 Non-fatal MI 64 76 0.84 Non-fatal stroke 15 12 1.24 Secondary endpoints \u2020 CV death 45 57 0.79 (0.69, 0.91) 0.0013 MI \u2021 65 76 0.84 (0.75, 0.95) 0.0045 Stroke \u2021 16 14 1.17 (0.91, 1.52) 0.22 All-cause mortality 51 65 0.78 (0.69, 0.89) 0.0003 * Dosed at 90 mg bid. \u2020 Note: rates of first events for the components CV Death, MI and Stroke are the actual rates for first events for each component and do not add up to the overall rate of events in the composite endpoint. \u2021 Including patients who could have had other non-fatal events or died. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10 - Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 1,1289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91; p=0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 - Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant (p=0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 - CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non\u00ad-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 to 325 mg then 75 to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR).

Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ACS or History of MI Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI Administer 60 mg ticagrelor tablets twice daily. ( 2.3 ) Acute Ischemic Stroke Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. ( 2.4 ) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. ( 2 ) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablets, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ]. 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Use ticagrelor tablets with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ]."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS > 5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y12-receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

( 5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Exelan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-604-3268 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days. Table 1: Non-CABG related bleeds (PLATO) Ticagrelor* N=9235 Clopidogrel N=9186 n (%) patients with event n (%) patients with event PLATO Major + Minor 713 (7.7) 567 (6.2) Major 362 (3.9) 306 (3.3) Fatal/Life-threatening 171 (1.9) 151 (1.6) Fatal 15 (0.2) 16 (0.2) Intracranial hemorrhage (Fatal/Life-threatening) 26 (0.3) 15 (0.2) PLATO Minor bleed: requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding. PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. * 90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Figure 4: Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe : Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (eg, systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications (4.3) ]. Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/ day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/ misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/ day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/ m2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in an adequate and well-controlled study conducted in 101 ticagrelor-treated pediatric patients, aged 2 to <18 for reducing the rate of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/ day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/ misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/ day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/ m2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Figure 5 \u2013 Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (\u00b1SE) following single oral doses of placebo, 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel Figure 6 \u2013 Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) following 6 weeks on placebo, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily Transitioning from clopidogrel to ticagrelor resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from ticagrelor to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Figure 5 Figure 6 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median tmax of 1.5 h (range 1.0\u20134.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median tmax of 2.5 h (range 1.5-5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30%-42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor Cmax, but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The Cmax of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and Cmax within 80-125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median tmax of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 \u2013 4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 \u20138.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30-40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and Cmax of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *Single dose of ticagrelor administered on a day without dialysis. **Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Effects of Other Drugs on ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. Tmax was delayed by 1-2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration (2) Effects of ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO ( NCT00391872 ) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9333) to clopidogrel (N=9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75-100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

Figure 10 \u2013 Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91; p =0.009). The results were similar for drug- eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant ( p =0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p -values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs . planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs . bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 \u2013 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study ( NCT01225562 ) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel- group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75- 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non- fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14.

Figure 10 Figure 11 Figure 12 Figure 13 Figure 14 14.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction THEMIS The THEMIS study (NCT01991795) was a double-blind, parallel group, study in which 19,220 patients with CAD and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) but no history of MI or stroke were randomized to twice daily ticagrelor or placebo, on a background of 75-150 mg of aspirin. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

Figure 15 - Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (THEMIS) T=Ticagrelor; P=Placebo; N= Number of patients The treatment effect of ticagrelor appeared similar across patient subgroups, see Figure 16. Figure 16 \u2013Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor (THEMIS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics.

Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Figure 15 Figure 16 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300-325 mg then 75-100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10 - Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5523 Placebo N=5493 HR (95% CI) p-value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke* 284 5.1% 347 6.3% 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) Time to Death* 36 0.6% 27 0.5% 1.33 (0.81, 2.19) Secondary Endpoint Time to first Ischemic Stroke 276 5.0% 345 6.2% 0.79 (0.68, 0.93) 0.004 CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier percentage calculated at 30 days; N = Number of patients *The number of patients with the event of interest. In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kalpan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor\u2019s treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention- to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%).

For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS. (1.1) to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets were established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). (1.2) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). (1.3) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets were established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ACS or History of MI Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. (2.2 ) Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI Administer 60 mg ticagrelor tablets twice daily. (2.3 ) Acute Ischemic Stroke Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. (2.4) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 to 100 mg. (2 ) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH 8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablets, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Clinical Studies (14)]. 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Use ticagrelor tablets with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ]."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor tablets than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor tablets is self-limiting. (5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. (5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. (5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor tablets increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor tablets in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor Tablets in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor tablets must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor tablets for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor tablets as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor tablets developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor tablets, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor tablets without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor tablets can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor tablets have been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor tablets are required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea.

Ticagrelor tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. * 90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 'Major fatal/life-threatening' CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3,000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. figure1.jpg figure2.jpg figure3.jpg figure4.jpg 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor tablets. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications (4.3) ]. Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. (7.1, 7.2) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. (7.3) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. (7.4) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor tablets. (7.5) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor tablets increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Ticagrelor tablets increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor tablets inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD (see\ufffd Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA \u00ae (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor tablets did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 mcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 mcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. figure5.jpg figure6.jpg 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1 to 4). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor tablets as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1 hour (range 1 to 4) for ticagrelor and 2 hours (range 1 to 8) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor Tablets CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor Tablets CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9,333) to clopidogrel (N=9,291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality. Table 7 \u2013 Patients with outcome events (PLATO) Ticagrelor * N=9,333 Clopidogrel N=9,291 Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value Events / 1,000 patient years Events / 1,000 patient years Composite of CV death, MI, or stroke 111 131 0.84 (0.77, 0.92) 0.0003 CV death 32 43 0.74 Non-fatal MI 64 76 0.84 Non-fatal stroke 15 12 1.24 Secondary endpoints \u2020 CV death 45 57 0.79 (0.69, 0.91) 0.0013 MI \u2021 65 76 0.84 (0.75, 0.95) 0.0045 Stroke \u2021 16 14 1.17 (0.91, 1.52) 0.22 All-cause mortality 51 65 0.78 (0.69, 0.89) 0.0003 *Dosed at 90 mg bid. \u2020 Note: rates of first events for the components CV Death, MI and Stroke are the actual rates for first events for each component and do not add up to the overall rate of events in the composite endpoint. \u2021 Including patients who could have had other non-fatal events or died. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non- fatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10 \u2013 Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91; p=0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant (p=0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 \u2013 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non- fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14. Figure 14 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 60 mg (PEGASUS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u226550% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

Figure 15 - Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (THEMIS) T = Ticagrelor; P = Placebo; N = Number of patients. The treatment effect of ticagrelor appeared similar across patient subgroups, see Figure 16.

Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. figure15.jpg figure16.jpg 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD 2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 to 325 mg then 75 to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10 - Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5,523 Placebo N=5,493 HR (95% CI) p-value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke * 284 5.1% 347 6.3% 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) Time to Death * 36 0.6% 27 0.5% 1.33 (0.81, 2.19) Secondary Endpoint Time to first Ischemic Stroke 276 5.0% 345 6.2% 0.79 (0.68, 0.93) 0.004 CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier percentage calculated at 30 days; N = Number of patients *The number of patients with the event of interest. In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). figure17.jpg figure18.jpg"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS > 5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the post-marketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (> 5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ScieGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (1-855-724-3436) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days. Table 1: Non-CABG related bleeds (PLATO) Ticagrelor * N=9,235 Clopidogrel N=9,186 n (%) patients with event n (%) patients with event PLATO Major + Minor 713 (7.7) 567 (6.2) Major 362 (3.9) 306 (3.3) Fatal/Life-threatening 171 (1.9) 151 (1.6) Fatal 15 (0.2) 16 (0.2) Intracranial hemorrhage (Fatal/Life-threatening) 26 (0.3) 15 (0.2) PLATO Minor bleed: requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding. PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. * 90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2: \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed. T = Ticagrelor; C = Clopidogrel.

TIMI Minor: Clinically apparent with 3 g/dL to 5 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin. * 60 mg BID The bleeding profile of ticagrelor 60 mg compared to aspirin alone was consistent across multiple pre-defined subgroups (e.g., by age, gender, weight, race, geographic region, concurrent conditions, concomitant therapy, stent, and medical history) for TIMI Major and TIMI Major or Minor bleeding events. Other Adverse Reactions in PEGASUS Adverse reactions that occurred in PEGASUS at rates of 3% or more are shown in Table 5.

Figure 4: Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe: Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure < 90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3,000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a > 50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by > 50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. 1 2 3 4 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (< 2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications (4.3) ] . Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in an adequate and well-controlled study conducted in 101 ticagrelor tablets-treated pediatric patients, aged 2 to < 18 for reducing the rate of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u2265 65 years of age and at least 15% were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Figure 5: Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (\u00b1SE) following single oral doses of placebo, 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel Figure 6: Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) following 6 weeks on placebo, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily Transitioning from clopidogrel to ticagrelor resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from ticagrelor to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . 5 6 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1.0 to 4.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80% to 125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 to 4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 to 8.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (> 99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30% to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7: Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8: Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor * See Dosage and Administration (2) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (> 99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30% to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7: Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8: Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor * See Dosage and Administration (2) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9,333) to clopidogrel (N=9,291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 mg to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were > 65 years and 15% were > 75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality. Table 7: Patients with outcome events (PLATO) Ticagrelor * N=9,333 Clopidogrel N=9,291 Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p -value Events/1,000 patient years Events/1,000 patient years Composite of CV death, MI, or stroke 111 131 0.84 (0.77, 0.92) 0.0003 CV death 32 43 0.74 Non-fatal MI 64 76 0.84 Non-fatal stroke 15 12 1.24 Secondary endpoints \u2020 CV death 45 57 0.79 (0.69, 0.91) 0.0013 MI \u2021 65 76 0.84 (0.75, 0.95) 0.0045 Stroke \u2021 16 14 1.17 (0.91, 1.52) 0.22 All-cause mortality 51 65 0.78 (0.69, 0.89) 0.0003 * Dosed at 90 mg bid. \u2020 Note: rates of first events for the components CV Death, MI and Stroke are the actual rates for first events for each component and do not add up to the overall rate of events in the composite endpoint. \u2021 Including patients who could have had other non-fatal events or died. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10: Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91; p =0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11: Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant ( p =0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p -values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs . planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs . bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264 100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12: CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 mg to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u2265 65 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13: Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID; CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs . aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs . aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14. Figure 14: Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 60 mg (PEGASUS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

Figure 15: Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (THEMIS) T = Ticagrelor; P = Placebo; N = Number of patients. The treatment effect of ticagrelor appeared similar across patient subgroups, see Figure 16.

Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. 15 16 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 40 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u2264 5) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD 2 score \u2265 6 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u2265 50% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 mg to 325 mg then 75 mg to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10: Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5,523 Placebo N=5,493 HR (95% CI) p -value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke * 284 5.1% 347 6.3% 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) Time to Death * 36 0.6% 27 0.5% 1.33 (0.81, 2.19) Secondary Endpoint Time to first Ischemic Stroke 276 5.0% 345 6.2% 0.79 (0.68, 0.93) 0.004 CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier percentage calculated at 30 days; N = Number of patients * The number of patients with the event of interest. In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17: Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor\u2019s treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18: Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). 17 18"

( 1.1 ) to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). ( 1.2 ) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ].

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ACS or History of MI Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI Administer 60 mg ticagrelor tablets twice daily. ( 2.3 ) Acute Ischemic Stroke Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. ( 2.4 ) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 to 100 mg. ( 2 ) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Administerthe first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablets, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ]. 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily.

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea.

Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. *90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3,000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES, excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. tica-tabs-fig-04 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications ( 4.3 )]. Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis)."

Bleeding is the expected pharmacologic effect of overdosing. If bleeding occurs, appropriate supportive measures should be taken. Platelet transfusion did not reverse the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor in healthy volunteers and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding. Other effects of overdose may include gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) or ventricular pauses. Monitor the ECG."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 mcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 mcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. tica-tabs-fig-05 tica-tabs-fig-06 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1 to 4). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR\u00adC124910XX) with a median t max of 1 hour (range 1 to 4) for ticagrelor and 2 hours (range 1 to 8) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and Cmax of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 - Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 - Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter .

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9,333) to clopidogrel (N=9,291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10 - Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91; p=0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 - Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant (p=0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 - CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non\u00ad-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14. Figure 14 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 60 mg (PEGASUS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9. Table 9 \u2013 Primary composite endpoint, primary endpoint components, and secondary endpoints (THEMIS) Ticagrelor N=9619 Placebo N=9,601 HR (95% CI) p -value Events / 1,000 patient years Events / 1,000 patient years Time to first CV death, MI, or stroke* 24 27 0.90 (0.81, 0.99) 0.04 CV death\u2020 12 11 1.02 (0.88, 1.18) Myocardial infarction\u2020 9 11 0.84 (0.71, 0.98) Stroke\u2020 6 7 0.82 (0.67, 0.99) Secondary endpoints CV death 12 11 1.02 (0.88, 1.18) Myocardial infarction 9 11 0.84 (0.71, 0.98) Ischemic stroke 5 6 0.80 (0.64, 0.99) All-cause death 18 19 0.98 (0.87, 1.10) CI = Confidence interval; CV = Cardiovascular; HR = Hazard ratio; MI = Myocardial infarction. * Primary endpoint \u2020 The event rate for the components CV death, MI and stroke are calculated from the actual number of first events for each component.

Figure 15 - Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (THEMIS) T = Ticagrelor; P = Placebo; N = Number of patients. The treatment effect of ticagrelor appeared similar across patient subgroups, see Figure 16. Figure 16 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor (THEMIS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. tica-tabs-fig-15 tica-tabs-fig-16 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 to 325 mg then 75 to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10 - Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5,523 Placebo N=5,493 HR (95% CI) p -value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke* 284 5.1% 347 6.3% 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) Time to Death* 36 0.6% 27 0.5% 1.33 (0.81, 2.19) Secondary Endpoint Time to first Ischemic Stroke 276 5% 345 6.2% 0.79 (0.68, 0.93) 0.004 CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier percentage calculated at 30 days; N = Number of patients *The number of patients with the event of interest. In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor\u2019s treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). tica-tabs-fig-17 tica-tabs-fig-18"

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ticagrelor tablets are a P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS. (1.1) to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets were established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). (1.2) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). (1.3) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets were established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ACS or History of MI Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. (2.2 ) Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI Administer 60 mg ticagrelor tablets twice daily. (2.3 ) Acute Ischemic Stroke Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. (2.4) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 to 100 mg. (2 ) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH 8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablets, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Clinical Studies (14)]. 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Use ticagrelor tablets with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ]."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor tablets than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor tablets is self-limiting. (5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. (5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. (5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor tablets increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor tablets in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor Tablets in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor tablets must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor tablets for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor tablets as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor tablets developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor tablets, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor tablets without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor tablets can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor tablets have been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor tablets are required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

Ticagrelor tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. * 90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 'Major fatal/life-threatening' CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3,000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. figure1.jpg figure2.jpg figure3.jpg figure4.jpg 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor tablets. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications (4.3) ]. Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. (7.1, 7.2) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. (7.3) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. (7.4) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor tablets. (7.5) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor tablets increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Ticagrelor tablets increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor tablets inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD (see\ufffd Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA \u00ae (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor tablets did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 mcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 mcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. figure5.jpg figure6.jpg 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1 to 4). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor tablets as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1 hour (range 1 to 4) for ticagrelor and 2 hours (range 1 to 8) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor Tablets CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor Tablets CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9,333) to clopidogrel (N=9,291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality. Table 7 \u2013 Patients with outcome events (PLATO) Ticagrelor * N=9,333 Clopidogrel N=9,291 Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value Events / 1,000 patient years Events / 1,000 patient years Composite of CV death, MI, or stroke 111 131 0.84 (0.77, 0.92) 0.0003 CV death 32 43 0.74 Non-fatal MI 64 76 0.84 Non-fatal stroke 15 12 1.24 Secondary endpoints \u2020 CV death 45 57 0.79 (0.69, 0.91) 0.0013 MI \u2021 65 76 0.84 (0.75, 0.95) 0.0045 Stroke \u2021 16 14 1.17 (0.91, 1.52) 0.22 All-cause mortality 51 65 0.78 (0.69, 0.89) 0.0003 *Dosed at 90 mg bid. \u2020 Note: rates of first events for the components CV Death, MI and Stroke are the actual rates for first events for each component and do not add up to the overall rate of events in the composite endpoint. \u2021 Including patients who could have had other non-fatal events or died. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non- fatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10 \u2013 Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91; p=0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant (p=0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 \u2013 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non- fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14. Figure 14 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 60 mg (PEGASUS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u226550% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. figure15.jpg figure16.jpg 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD 2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 to 325 mg then 75 to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10 - Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5,523 Placebo N=5,493 HR (95% CI) p-value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke * 284 5.1% 347 6.3% 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) Time to Death * 36 0.6% 27 0.5% 1.33 (0.81, 2.19) Secondary Endpoint Time to first Ischemic Stroke 276 5.0% 345 6.2% 0.79 (0.68, 0.93) 0.004 CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier percentage calculated at 30 days; N = Number of patients *The number of patients with the event of interest. In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). figure17.jpg figure18.jpg"

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ticagrelor tablets are a P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS (1.1) to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). ( 1.2 ) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor is indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. (5.3) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. (5.5) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), and 4.3% (another studyPEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y12-receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. (5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bionpharma Inc. at 1-888-235-BION or 1-888-235-2466 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days. Table 1 - Non-CABG related bleeds (PLATO) Ticagrelor 90 mg BID N=9235 Clopidogrel N=9186 n (%) patients with event n (%) patients with event PLATO Major + Minor 713 (7.7) 567 (6.2) Major 362 (3.9) 306 (3.3) Fatal/Life-threatening 171 (1.9) 151 (1.6) Fatal 15 (0.2) 16 (0.2) Intracranial hemorrhage (Fatal/Life-threatening) 26 (0.3) 15 (0.2) PLATO Minor bleed: requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding. PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 - Major fatal/life-threatening CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other haemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. When antiplatelet therapy was stopped 5 days before CABG, major bleeding occurred in 75% of ticagrelor treated patients and 79% on clopidogrel. Other Adverse Reactions in PLATO Adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of 4% or more in PLATO are shown in Table 3.

Figure 4 - Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe : Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. figure-01 figure-02 figure-03 figure-04 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications (4.3) ] . Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. (7.1 , 7.2) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. (7.3) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. (7.4) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. (7.5) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA\u00ae (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . figure-05 figure-06 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1.0\u20134.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5-5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30%-42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80-125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 \u2013 4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 \u20138.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30-40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 - Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1-2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 - Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor * See Dosage and Administration (2) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 - Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1-2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 - Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor * See Dosage and Administration (2) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO ( NCT00391872 ) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9333) to clopidogrel (N=9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The studys primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75-100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

Figure 10 - Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12\u2011month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated definite) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91; p =0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant ( p =0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs . planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs . bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study ( NCT01225562 ) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75-150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were 50 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age 65 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were 40 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score 5) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD2 score 6 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis 50% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300-325 mg then 75-100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR).

Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor\u2019s treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified.

Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). figure-17 figure-18"

For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS. ( 1.1 ) to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). ( 1.2 ) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ACS or History of MI Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI Administer 60 mg ticagrelor tablets twice daily. ( 2.3 ) Acute Ischemic Stroke Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. ( 2.4 ) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 to 100 mg. ( 2 ) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Administerthe first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablets, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ]. 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets and then continuewith 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Use ticagrelor tablets with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novadoz Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-855-668-2369 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. *90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Figure 4 -Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe: Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3,000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES, excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. tica-tabs-fig-04 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications ( 4.3 )]. Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 mcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 mcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Figure 5 - Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (\u00b1SE) following single oral doses of placebo, 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel Figure 6 - Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) following 6 weeks on placebo, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily Transitioning from clopidogrel to ticagrelor resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from ticagrelor to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. tica-tabs-fig-05 tica-tabs-fig-06 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1 to 4). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR\u00adC124910XX) with a median t max of 1 hour (range 1 to 4) for ticagrelor and 2 hours (range 1 to 8) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and Cmax of ticagrelor, 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function.

The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 - Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter .

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 mcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 mcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1 to 4). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR\u00adC124910XX) with a median t max of 1 hour (range 1 to 4) for ticagrelor and 2 hours (range 1 to 8) for AR-C124910XX.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9,333) to clopidogrel (N=9,291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10 - Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 1,1289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91; p=0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 - Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant (p=0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 - CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non\u00ad-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 to 325 mg then 75 to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10 - Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5,523 Placebo N=5,493 HR (95% CI) p -value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke* 284 5.1% 347 6.3% 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) Time to Death* 36 0.6% 27 0.5% 1.33 (0.81, 2.19) Secondary Endpoint Time to first Ischemic Stroke 276 5% 345 6.2% 0.79 (0.68, 0.93) 0.004 CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier percentage calculated at 30 days; N = Number of patients *The number of patients with the event of interest. In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor\u2019s treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). tica-tabs-fig-17 tica-tabs-fig-18"

      "Dispense with Medication Guide available at: www.avkare.com MEDICATION GUIDE Ticagrelor (TYE-ka-GREL-or) Tablets What is the most important information I should know about ticagrelor tablets? Ticagrelor tablets are used to lower your chance of having, or dying from, a heart attack or stroke. Ticagrelor tablets ( and similar drugs) can cause bleeding that can be serious and sometimes lead to death. In cases of serious bleeding, such as internal bleeding, the bleeding may result in the need for blood transfusions or surgery. While you take ticagrelor tablets: you may bruise and bleed more easily you are more likely to have nose bleeds it will take longer than usual for any bleeding to stop Call your healthcare provider right away, if you have any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding while taking ticagrelor tablets: bleeding that is severe or that you cannot control pink, red or brown urine vomiting blood or your vomit looks like \u201ccoffee grounds\u201d red or black stools (looks like tar) coughing up blood or blood clots Do not stop taking ticagrelor tablets without talking to the healthcare provider who prescribes it for you. People who are treated with a stent, and stop taking ticagrelor tablets too soon, have a higher risk of getting a blood clot in the stent, having a heart attack, or dying. If you stop ticagrelor tablets because of bleeding, or for other reasons, your risk of a heart attack or stroke may increase. Your healthcare provider may instruct you to stop taking ticagrelor tablets 5 days before surgery. This will help to decrease your risk of bleeding with your surgery or procedure. Your healthcare provider should tell you when to start taking ticagrelor tablets again, as soon as possible after surgery. Taking ticagrelor tablets with aspirin Ticagrelor tablets are taken with aspirin, unless your healthcare provider specifically tells you otherwise. Talk to your healthcare provider about the dose of aspirin that you should take with ticagrelor tablets. In most cases, you should not take a dose of aspirin higher than 100 mg daily. Do not take doses of aspirin higher than what your healthcare provider tells you to take. Tell your healthcare provider if you take other medicines that contain aspirin, and do not take new over-the-counter medicines with aspirin in them. What are ticagrelor tablets? Ticagrelor tablets are a prescription medicine used to: decrease your risk of death, heart attack, and stroke in people with a blockage of blood flow to the heart (acute coronary syndrome or ACS) or a history of a heart attack. Ticagrelor tablets can also decrease your risk of blood clots in your stent in people who have received stents for the treatment of ACS. decrease your risk of a first heart attack or stroke in people who have a condition where the blood flow to the heart is decreased (coronary artery disease or CAD) who are at high risk for having a heart attack or stroke. decrease your risk of stroke in people who are having a stroke (acute ischemic stroke) or mini-stroke (transient ischemic attack or TIA). It is not known if ticagrelor tablets are safe and effective in children.

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS > 5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the post-marketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (> 5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ScieGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (1-855-724-3436) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days. Table 1: Non-CABG related bleeds (PLATO) Ticagrelor * N=9,235 Clopidogrel N=9,186 n (%) patients with event n (%) patients with event PLATO Major + Minor 713 (7.7) 567 (6.2) Major 362 (3.9) 306 (3.3) Fatal/Life-threatening 171 (1.9) 151 (1.6) Fatal 15 (0.2) 16 (0.2) Intracranial hemorrhage (Fatal/Life-threatening) 26 (0.3) 15 (0.2) PLATO Minor bleed: requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding. PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. * 90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2: \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed. T = Ticagrelor; C = Clopidogrel.

Other Adverse Reactions in PLATO Adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of 4% or more in PLATO are shown in Table 3. Table 3: Percentage of patients reporting non-hemorrhagic adverse reactions at least 4% or more in either group and more frequently on ticagrelor (PLATO) Ticagrelor * N=9,235 Clopidogrel N=9,186 Dyspnea 13.8 7.8 Dizziness 4.5 3.9 Nausea 4.3 3.8 * 90 mg BID Bleeding in PEGASUS (Secondary Prevention in Patients with a History of Myocardial Infarction) Overall outcome of bleeding events in the PEGASUS study are shown in Table 4.

TIMI Minor: Clinically apparent with 3 g/dL to 5 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin. * 60 mg BID The bleeding profile of ticagrelor 60 mg compared to aspirin alone was consistent across multiple pre-defined subgroups (e.g., by age, gender, weight, race, geographic region, concurrent conditions, concomitant therapy, stent, and medical history) for TIMI Major and TIMI Major or Minor bleeding events. Other Adverse Reactions in PEGASUS Adverse reactions that occurred in PEGASUS at rates of 3% or more are shown in Table 5.

Figure 4: Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe: Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure < 90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3,000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a > 50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by > 50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. 1 2 3 4 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (< 2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications (4.3) ] . Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in an adequate and well-controlled study conducted in 101 ticagrelor tablets-treated pediatric patients, aged 2 to < 18 for reducing the rate of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u2265 65 years of age and at least 15% were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

Bleeding is the expected pharmacologic effect of overdosing. If bleeding occurs, appropriate supportive measures should be taken. Platelet transfusion did not reverse the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor in healthy volunteers and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding. Other effects of overdose may include gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) or ventricular pauses. Monitor the ECG."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . 5 6 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1.0 to 4.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80% to 125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 to 4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 to 8.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (> 99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30% to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7: Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8: Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor * See Dosage and Administration (2) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9,333) to clopidogrel (N=9,291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 mg to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were > 65 years and 15% were > 75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10: Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91; p =0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11: Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant ( p =0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p -values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs . planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs . bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264 100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12: CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 mg to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u2265 65 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13: Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID; CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs . aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs . aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14. Figure 14: Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 60 mg (PEGASUS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. 10 11 12 13 14 14.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction THEMIS The THEMIS study (NCT01991795) was a double-blind, parallel group, study in which 19,220 patients with CAD and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) but no history of MI or stroke were randomized to twice daily ticagrelor or placebo, on a background of 75 mg to 150 mg of aspirin. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9. Table 9: Primary composite endpoint, primary endpoint components, and secondary endpoints (THEMIS) Ticagrelor N=9,619 Placebo N=9,601 HR (95% CI) p -value Events/1,000 patient years Events/1,000 patient years Time to first CV death, MI, or stroke * 24 27 0.90 (0.81, 0.99) 0.04 CV death \u2020 12 11 1.02 (0.88, 1.18) Myocardial infarction \u2020 9 11 0.84 (0.71, 0.98) Stroke \u2020 6 7 0.82 (0.67, 0.99) Secondary endpoints CV death 12 11 1.02 (0.88, 1.18) Myocardial infarction 9 11 0.84 (0.71, 0.98) Ischemic stroke 5 6 0.80 (0.64, 0.99) All-cause death 18 19 0.98 (0.87, 1.10) CI = Confidence interval; CV = Cardiovascular; HR = Hazard ratio; MI = Myocardial infarction. * Primary endpoint \u2020 The event rate for the components CV death, MI and stroke are calculated from the actual number of first events for each component.

Figure 15: Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (THEMIS) T = Ticagrelor; P = Placebo; N = Number of patients. The treatment effect of ticagrelor appeared similar across patient subgroups, see Figure 16. Figure 16: Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor (THEMIS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. 15 16 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 40 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u2264 5) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD 2 score \u2265 6 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u2265 50% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 mg to 325 mg then 75 mg to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10: Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5,523 Placebo N=5,493 HR (95% CI) p -value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke * 284 5.1% 347 6.3% 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) Time to Death * 36 0.6% 27 0.5% 1.33 (0.81, 2.19) Secondary Endpoint Time to first Ischemic Stroke 276 5.0% 345 6.2% 0.79 (0.68, 0.93) 0.004 CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier percentage calculated at 30 days; N = Number of patients * The number of patients with the event of interest. In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17: Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor\u2019s treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18: Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). 17 18"

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ticagrelor tablet is a P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduce the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS. (1.1) to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). (1.2) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). (1.3) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduce the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets were established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ACS or History of MI Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI Administer 60 mg ticagrelor tablets twice daily. ( 2.3 ) Acute Ischemic Stroke Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. ( 2.4 ) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg. (2 ) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablets, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Use ticagrelor tablets with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ] ."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor tablets than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor tablets is self-limiting. (5.3) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. (5.5) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. (5.7) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor tablets increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor tablets in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor Tablets in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor tablets must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor tablets for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor tablets as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor tablets developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor tablets, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor tablets without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor tablets can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor tablets patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor tablets have been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor tablets is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor tablets interference, ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. (5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Oryza Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-637-4281 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor tablets compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 - \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor tablets and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor tablets and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor tablets (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor tablets 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor tablets 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor tablets than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor tablets 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor tablets 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. figure_1 fiigure_2 figure_3 figure_4 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor tablets. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications (4.3) ] . Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. (7.1 , 7.2) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor tablets. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA\u00ae (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor tablets did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . figure_5 figure_6 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1.0\u20134.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5-5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30%-42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80-125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 \u2013 4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 \u20138.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30-40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor tablets 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor tablets was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor tablets is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor tablets was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 - Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1-2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 - Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor * See Dosage and Administration (2) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9333) to clopidogrel (N=9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor tablets received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75-100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

Figure 10 - Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12\u2011month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91; p=0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant ( p =0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 \u2013 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75-150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor tablets in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor tablets plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs . aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor tablets 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor tablets were superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 15) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, MI, or stroke. Figure 15 - Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (THEMIS) T = Ticagrelor; P = Placebo; N = Number of patients. The treatment effect of ticagrelor tablets appeared similar across patient subgroups, see Figure 16. Figure 16 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor (THEMIS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. figure_15 figure_16 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor tablets 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor tablets (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300-325 mg then 75-100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor tablets were superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR).

Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor tablets\u2019 treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor tablets was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 - Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). figure_17 figure_18"

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ticagrelor is a P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor indicated \u2022 to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduce the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS. ( 1 .1) \u2022 to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduce the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 ACS or History of MI \u2022 Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. \u2022 Acute Ischemic Stroke o Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. ( 2.4 ) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg. ( 2 ) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablets, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. Initiate ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Use ticagrelor tablets with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] ."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor tablets than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor tablets is self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor tablets increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor tablets in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor Tablets in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor tablets must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor tablets for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor tablets as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) of patients treated with ticagrelor tablets developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), and 4.3% (PEGASUS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor tablets, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor tablets without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor tablets patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor tablets is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Solco Healthcare US, LLC at 1-866-257-2597 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. * 90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor tablets compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Figure 4 \u2013 Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe : Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor tablets and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor tablets and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor tablets (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor tablets 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor tablets 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. c7aeae20-figure-01 c7aeae20-figure-02 figure4 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor tablets. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [ see Contraindications ( 4.3 ) ]. Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) \u2022 Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) \u2022 Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) \u2022 Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor tablets. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor tablets increase serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Ticagrelor tablets increase serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor tablets inhibit the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor tablets therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD ( see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in an adequate and well-controlled study conducted in 101 ticagrelor tablets-treated pediatric patients, aged 2 to <18 for reducing the rate of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor tablets did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, and THALES."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE There is currently no known treatment to reverse the effects of ticagrelor tablets, and ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Treatment of overdose should follow local standard medical practice. Bleeding is the expected pharmacologic effect of overdosing. If bleeding occurs, appropriate supportive measures should be taken. Platelet transfusion did not reverse the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor tablets in healthy volunteers and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding. Other effects of overdose may include gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) or ventricular pauses. Monitor the ECG."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Figure 5 \u2013 Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (\u00b1SE) following single oral doses of placebo, 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel Figure 6 \u2013 Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) following 6 weeks on placebo, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily Transitioning from clopidogrel to ticagrelor tablets resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from ticagrelor tablets to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor tablets without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . c7aeae20-figure-05 c7aeae20-figure-06 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1.0\u20134.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5-5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30%-42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor tablets as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, are bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80-125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 \u20134.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 \u20138.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30-40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor tablets 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor tablets were administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor tablets are not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor tablets was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor Tablets CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1-2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Effects of Ticagrelor Tablets on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgestrel, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

Uterine carcinomas, uterine adenocarcinomas and hepatocellular adenomas were seen in female rats at doses of 180 mg/kg/day (29-fold the maximally recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily on the basis of AUC), whereas 60 mg/kg/day (8-fold the MRHD based on AUC) was not carcinogenic in female rats. Mutagenesis Ticagrelor did not demonstrate genotoxicity when tested in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity test, mouse lymphoma assay and the rat micronucleus test. The active O-demethylated metabolite did not demonstrate genotoxicity in the Ames assay and mouse lymphoma assay. Impairment of Fertility Ticagrelor had no effect on male fertility at doses up to 180 mg/kg/day or on female fertility at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (>15-fold the MRHD on the basis of AUC).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor tablets (N=9333) to clopidogrel (N=9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor tablets received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75-100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10 \u2013 Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91; p=0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant (p=0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs . planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor tablets when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 \u2013 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, 90 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75-150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. The 90 mg regimen of ticagrelor tablets in combination with aspirin was superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor tablets plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone was 1.19% for the 90 mg regimen. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. c7aeae20-figure-10 c7aeae20-figure-11 c7aeae20-figure-12 figure 13 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor tablets 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD 2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor tablets (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300-325 mg then 75-100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor tablets were superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR).

Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor tablets was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18).

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ticagrelor tablets are a P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS (1.1) to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). ( 1.2 ) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor is indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 ACS or History of MI \u2218 Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. (2.2) \u2022 Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI \u2218 Administer 60 mg ticagrelor twice daily. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Acute Ischemic Stroke \u2218 Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. ( 2.4 ) Use ticagrelor with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg. ( 2 ) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Do not administer ticagrelor with another oral P2Y12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Use ticagrelor with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. (5.3) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. (5.5) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), and 4.3% (another studyPEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y12-receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. (5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bionpharma Inc. at 1-888-235-BION or 1-888-235-2466 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 - Major fatal/life-threatening CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other haemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Figure 4 - Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe : Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. figure-01 figure-02 figure-03 figure-04 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications (4.3) ] . Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. (7.1 , 7.2) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. (7.3) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. (7.4) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. (7.5) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA\u00ae (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Figure 5 - Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (\u00b1SE) following single oral doses of placebo, 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel Figure 6 - Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) following 6 weeks on placebo, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily \u25cf Ticagrelor \u25b2Clopidogrel \u25a0 Placebo Transitioning from clopidogrel to ticagrelor resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from ticagrelor to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . figure-05 figure-06 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1.0\u20134.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5-5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30%-42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80-125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 \u2013 4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 \u20138.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30-40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 - Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1-2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 - Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor * See Dosage and Administration (2) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity.

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO ( NCT00391872 ) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9333) to clopidogrel (N=9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The studys primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75-100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

Figure 10 - Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12\u2011month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated definite) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91; p =0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant ( p =0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs . planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs . bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study ( NCT01225562 ) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75-150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were 50 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age 65 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

Patients were eligible to participate if they were 40 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score 5) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD2 score 6 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis 50% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300-325 mg then 75-100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10 - Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5523 Placebo N=5493 HR (95% CI) p-value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke* 284 5.1% 347 6.3% 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) Time to Death* 36 0.6% 27 0.5% 1.33 (0.81, 2.19) Secondary Endpoint Time to first Ischemic Stroke 276 5.0% 345 6.2% 0.79 (0.68, 0.93) 0.004 CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier percentage calculated at 30 days; N = Number of patients *The number of patients with the event of interest. In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor\u2019s treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). figure-17 figure-18"

( 2.3 ) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg. ( 2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y12 platelet inhibitor.

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.6 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 1.0% (THALES) and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including, the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient's serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lifestar Pharma LLC at 1-888-995-4337 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in THEMIS (Prevention of major CV events in patients with CAD and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) The Kaplan-Meier curve of time to first TIMI Major bleeding event is presented in Figure 3. Figure 3 - Time to first TIMI Major bleeding event (THEMIS) T = Ticagrelor; P = Placebo; N = Number of patients The bleeding events in THEMIS are shown below in Table 6.

Figure 4 - Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe : Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (eg, systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications (4.3)] . Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash figure3 figure4"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in an adequate and well-controlled study conducted in 101 ticagrelor-treated pediatric patients, aged 2 to <18 for reducing the rate of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in THEMIS and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in THEMIS and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Figure 5 \u2013 Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (\u00b1SE) following single oral doses of placebo, 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel Figure 6 - Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) following 6 weeks on placebo, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily Transitioning from clopidogrel to ticagrelor resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from ticagrelor to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1.0\u20134.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5-5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30%-42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80-125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 \u2013 4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 \u20138.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30-40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor * Single-dose of ticagrelor administered on a day without dialysis ** Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. Tmax was delayed by 1-2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration (2) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9. Table 9 \u2013 Primary composite endpoint, primary endpoint components, and secondary endpoints (THEMIS) Ticagrelor N=9619 Placebo N=9601 HR (95% CI) p -value Events / 1000 patient years Events / 1000 patient years Time to first CV death, MI, or stroke * 24 27 0.90 (0.81, 0.99) 0.04 CV death \u2020 12 11 1.02 (0.88, 1.18) Myocardial infarction \u2020 9 11 0.84 (0.71, 0.98) Stroke \u2020 6 7 0.82 (0.67, 0.99) Secondary endpoints CV death 12 11 1.02 (0.88, 1.18) Myocardial infarction 9 11 0.84 (0.71, 0.98) Ischemic stroke 5 6 0.80 (0.64, 0.99) All-cause death 18 19 0.98 (0.87, 1.10) CI = Confidence interval; CV = Cardiovascular; HR = Hazard ratio; MI = Myocardial infarction. * Primary endpoint \u2020 The event rate for the components CV death, MI and stroke are calculated from the actual number of first events for each component. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 15) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, MI, or stroke. Figure 15 - Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (THEMIS) T = Ticagrelor; P = Placebo; N = Number of patients. The treatment effect of ticagrelor appeared similar across patient subgroups, see Figure 16. Figure 16 \u2013Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor (THEMIS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300-325 mg then 75-100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10 - Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5523 Placebo N=5493 HR (95% CI) p -value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke* 284 5.1% 347 6.3% 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) Time to Death* 36 0.6% 27 0.5% 1.33 (0.81, 2.19) Secondary Endpoint Time to first Ischemic Stroke 276 5.0% 345 6.2% 0.79 (0.68, 0.93) 0.004 CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier percentage calculated at 30 days; N = Number of patients *The number of patients with the event of interest. In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor's treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). figure15 figure_16 figure17 figure18"

For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS. (1.1) \u2022 to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablet was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). (1.2) \u2022 to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). (1.3) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablet also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablet is indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablet was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor tablet is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 ACS or History of MI o Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. (2.2) \u2022 Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI o Administer 60 mg ticagrelor tablets twice daily. (2.3) \u2022 Acute Ischemic Stroke o Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. (2.4) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 to 100 mg. (2) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. (2.2) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablet to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Do not administer ticagrelor tablet with another oral P2Y12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablet. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablet, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablet twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablet twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablet with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablet based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14)]. 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablet twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor tablet with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14)]. 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablet and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Use ticagrelor tablet with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14)]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. (5.3) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. (5.5) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. (5.7) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. (5.1, 5.3, 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. * 90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Figure 4 -Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe: Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. figure 1 figure 2 figure 3 figure 4 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications (4.3)] . Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. (7.1, 7.2) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. (7.3) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. (7.4) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. (7.4) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. (7.5) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD ( see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA\u00ae (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis)."

Bleeding is the expected pharmacologic effect of overdosing. If bleeding occurs, appropriate supportive measures should be taken. Platelet transfusion did not reverse the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor in healthy volunteers and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding. Other effects of overdose may include gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) or ventricular pauses. Monitor the ECG."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . figure 5 figure 6 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1 to 4). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1 hour (range 1 to 4) for ticagrelor and 2 hours (range 1 to 8) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9333) to clopidogrel (N=9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10 \u2013 Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.91; p =0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant ( p =0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p -values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs . planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs . bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 \u2013 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 15) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, MI, or stroke. Figure 15 -Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (THEMIS) The treatment effect of ticagrelor appeared similar across patient subgroups, see Figure 16. Figure 16 \u2013Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor (THEMIS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. figure 15 figure 16 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD 2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 to 325 mg then 75 to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10 -Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5523 Placebo N=5493 HR(95% CI) p -value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke * 284 5.1% 347 6.3% 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) Time to Death * 36 0.6% 27 0.5% 1.33 (0.81, 2.19) Secondary Endpoint Time to first Ischemic Stroke 276 5% 345 6.2% 0.79 (0.68, 0.93) 0.004 CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier percentage calculated at 30 days; N = Number of patients * The number of patients with the event of interest. In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor\u2019s treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). figure 17 figure 18"

(1.1) to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). (1.2) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). (1.3) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ACS or History of MI Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. (2.2) Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI Administer 60 mg ticagrelor tablets twice daily. (2.3) Acute Ischemic Stroke Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. (2.4) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 to 100 mg. (2) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. (2.2) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH 8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablets, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ]. 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days.

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. (5.3) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. (5.5) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. (5.7) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea.

Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 'Major fatal/life-threatening' CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. TIMI Minor: Clinically apparent with 3 to 5 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin. The bleeding profile of ticagrelor 60 mg compared to aspirin alone was consistent across multiple pre-defined subgroups (e.g., by age, gender, weight, race, geographic region, concurrent conditions, concomitant therapy, stent, and medical history) for TIMI Major and TIMI Major or Minor bleeding events. Other Adverse Reactions in PEGASUS Adverse reactions that occurred in PEGASUS at rates of 3% or more are shown in Table 5.

Figure 4 - Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe : Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages <10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3,000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. figure1.jpg figure2.jpg figure3.jpg figure4.jpg 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications (4.3) ]. Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. (7.1 , 7.2) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. (7.3) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. (7.4) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. (7.4) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. (7.5) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

Bleeding is the expected pharmacologic effect of overdosing. If bleeding occurs, appropriate supportive measures should be taken. Platelet transfusion did not reverse the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor in healthy volunteers and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding. Other effects of overdose may include gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) or ventricular pauses. Monitor the ECG."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 mcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 mcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. figure5.jpg figure6.jpg 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1 to 4). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1 hour (range 1 to 4) for ticagrelor and 2 hours (range 1 to 8) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration (2) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9,333) to clopidogrel (N=9,291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

Figure 10 \u2013 Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91; p=0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant (p=0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 \u2013 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non- fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14. Figure 14 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 60 mg (PEGASUS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. figure10.jpg figure11.jpg figure12.jpg figure13.jpg figure14.jpg 14.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction THEMIS The THEMIS study (NCT01991795) was a double-blind, parallel group, study in which 19,220 patients with CAD and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) but no history of MI or stroke were randomized to twice daily ticagrelor or placebo, on a background of 75 to 150 mg of aspirin. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u226550% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9. Table 9 \u2013 Primary composite endpoint, primary endpoint components, and secondary endpoints (THEMIS) Ticagrelor N=9,619 Placebo N=9,601 HR (95% CI) p-value Events / 1,000 patient years Events / 1,000 patient years Time to first CV death, MI, or stroke Primary endpoint 24 27 0.90 (0.81, 0.99) 0.04 CV death The event rate for the components CV death, MI and stroke are calculated from the actual number of first events for each component. 12 11 1.02 (0.88, 1.18) Myocardial infarction 9 11 0.84 (0.71, 0.98) Stroke 6 7 0.82 (0.67, 0.99) Secondary endpoints CV death 12 11 1.02 (0.88, 1.18) Myocardial infarction 9 11 0.84 (0.71, 0.98) Ischemic stroke 5 6 0.80 (0.64, 0.99) All-cause death 18 19 0.98 (0.87, 1.10) CI = Confidence interval; CV = Cardiovascular; HR = Hazard ratio; MI = Myocardial infarction. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 15) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, MI, or stroke. Figure 15 - Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (THEMIS) T = Ticagrelor; P = Placebo; N = Number of patients. The treatment effect of ticagrelor appeared similar across patient subgroups, see Figure 16. Figure 16 \u2013Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor (THEMIS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. figure15.jpg figure16.jpg 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD 2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 to 325 mg then 75 to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10 - Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5,523 Placebo N=5,493 HR(95% CI) p-value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke The number of patients with the event of interest.

Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor\u2019s treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). figure17.jpg figure18.jpg"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novadoz Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-855-668-2369 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days. Table 1 - Non-CABG related bleeds (PLATO) Ticagrelor * N=9,235 Clopidogrel N=9,186 n (%) patients with event n (%) patients with event PLATO Major + Minor 713 (7.7) 567 (6.2) Major 362 (3.9) 306 (3.3) Fatal/Life-threatening 171 (1.9) 151 (1.6) Fatal 15 (0.2) 16 (0.2) Intracranial hemorrhage (Fatal/Life-threatening) 26 (0.3) 15 (0.2) PLATO Minor bleed: requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding. PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. *90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Other Adverse Reactions in PEGASUS Adverse reactions that occurred in PEGASUS at rates of 3% or more are shown in Table 5.

Figure 4 -Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe: Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3,000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES, excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. tica-tabs-fig-04 tica-tabs-fig-01 tica-tabs-fig-02 tica-tabs-fig-03 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications ( 4.3 )]. Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 mcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 mcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. tica-tabs-fig-05 tica-tabs-fig-06 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1 to 4). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR\u00adC124910XX) with a median t max of 1 hour (range 1 to 4) for ticagrelor and 2 hours (range 1 to 8) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and Cmax of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 - Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 - Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter . In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-\u00adC124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity.

The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and Cmax of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 - Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 - Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter . In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-\u00adC124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 9.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9,333) to clopidogrel (N=9,291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality. Table 7 - Patients with outcome events (PLATO) Ticagrelor * N=9,333 Clopidogrel N=9,291 Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p -value Events / 1,000 patient years Events / 1,000 patient years Composite of CV death, MI, or stroke 111 131 0.84 (0.77, 0.92) 0.0003 CV death 32 43 0.74 Non-fatal MI 64 76 0.84 Non-fatal stroke 15 12 1.24 Secondary endpoints \u2020 CV death 45 57 0.79 (0.69, 0.91) 0.0013 MI \u2021 65 76 0.84 (0.75, 0.95) 0.0045 Stroke \u2021 16 14 1.17 (0.91, 1.52) 0.22 All-cause mortality 51 65 0.78 (0.69, 0.89) 0.0003 * Dosed at 90 mg bid. \u2020 Note: rates of first events for the components CV Death, MI and Stroke are the actual rates for first events for each component and do not add up to the overall rate of events in the composite endpoint. \u2021 Including patients who could have had other non-fatal events or died. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10 - Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91; p=0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 - Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant (p=0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 - CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non\u00ad-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 to 325 mg then 75 to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10 - Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5,523 Placebo N=5,493 HR (95% CI) p -value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke* 284 5.1% 347 6.3% 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) Time to Death* 36 0.6% 27 0.5% 1.33 (0.81, 2.19) Secondary Endpoint Time to first Ischemic Stroke 276 5% 345 6.2% 0.79 (0.68, 0.93) 0.004 CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier percentage calculated at 30 days; N = Number of patients *The number of patients with the event of interest. In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor\u2019s treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). tica-tabs-fig-17 tica-tabs-fig-18"

Your healthcare provider should tell you when to start taking ticagrelor tablets again, as soon as possible after surgery. <content styleCode=\"bold\">Taking ticagrelor tablets with aspirin </content>  Ticagrelor tablets are taken with aspirin, unless your healthcare provider specifically tells you otherwise. Talk to your healthcare provider about the dose of aspirin that you should take with ticagrelor tablets. In most cases, you should not take a dose of aspirin higher than 100 mg daily. Do not take doses of aspirin higher than what your healthcare provider tells you to take. Tell your healthcare provider if you take other medicines that contain aspirin, and do not take new over-the-counter medicines with aspirin in them.  </td></tr><tr styleCode=\"Botrule\"><td styleCode=\"Lrule Rrule\" align=\"justify\" valign=\"middle\"><content styleCode=\"bold\">What are ticagrelor tablets? </content>  Ticagrelor tablets are a prescription medicine used to:  <list listType=\"unordered\" styleCode=\"disc\"><item>decrease your risk of death, heart attack, and stroke in people with a blockage of blood flow to the heart (acute coronary syndrome or ACS) or a history of a heart attack.

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT ( 5.7 ). 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 1.0% (THALES) and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hisun Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. at 1-855-554-4786 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in THEMIS (Prevention of major CV events in patients with CAD and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) The Kaplan-Meier curve of time to first TIMI Major bleeding event is presented in Figure 3. Figure 3 - Time to first TIMI Major bleeding event (THEMIS) T = Ticagrelor; P = Placebo; N = Number of patients The bleeding events in THEMIS are shown below in Table 6.

Figure 4 - Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe : Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (eg, systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). 15 16 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications ( 4.3 )]. Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA\u00ae (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in THEMIS and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in THEMIS and THALES."

Bleeding is the expected pharmacologic effect of overdosing. If bleeding occurs, appropriate supportive measures should be taken. Platelet transfusion did not reverse the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor in healthy volunteers and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding. Other effects of overdose may include gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) or ventricular pauses. Monitor the ECG."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Figure 5 - Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (\u00b1SE) following single oral doses of placebo, 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel Figure 6 - Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) following 6 weeks on placebo, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily \u2022 Ticagrelor \u25b2 Clopidogrel \u25a0 Placebo Transitioning from clopidogrel to ticagrelor tablets resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from ticagrelor tablets to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor tablets without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Figure 3 Figure 4 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1.0-4.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5-5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30%-42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80-125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0-4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0-8.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30-40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 - Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor Tablets CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1-2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 - Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor *See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ). Effects of Ticagrelor Tablets on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor tablets were superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke.

The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD 2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor tablets (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300-325 mg then 75-100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR).

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk.

      "MEDICATION GUIDE TICAGRELOR (tye-KA-grel-or) Tablets What is the most important information I should know about ticagrelor tablets? Ticagrelor tablets are used to lower your chance of having, or dying from, a heart attack or stroke. Ticagrelor tablets (and similar drugs) can cause bleeding that can be serious and sometimes lead to death. In cases of serious bleeding, such as internal bleeding, the bleeding may result in the need for blood transfusions or surgery. While you take ticagrelor tablets: \u2022 you may bruise and bleed more easily \u2022 you are more likely to have nose bleeds \u2022 it will take longer than usual for any bleeding to stop Call your healthcare provider right away, if you have any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding while taking ticagrelor tablets: \u2022 bleeding that is severe or that you cannot control \u2022 pink, red or brown urine \u2022 vomiting blood or your vomit looks like \u201ccoffee grounds\u201d \u2022 red or black stools (looks like tar) \u2022 coughing up blood or blood clots Do not stop taking ticagrelor tablets without talking to the healthcare provider who prescribes it for you. People who are treated with a stent, and stop taking ticagrelor tablets too soon, have a higher risk of getting a blood clot in the stent, having a heart attack, or dying. If you stop ticagrelor tablets because of bleeding, or for other reasons, your risk of a heart attack or stroke may increase. Your healthcare provider may instruct you to stop taking ticagrelor tablets 5 days before surgery. This will help to decrease your risk of bleeding with your surgery or procedure. Your healthcare provider should tell you when to start taking ticagrelor tablets again, as soon as possible after surgery. Taking ticagrelor tablets with aspirin Ticagrelor tablets are taken with aspirin, unless your healthcare provider specifically tells you otherwise. Talk to your healthcare provider about the dose of aspirin that you should take with ticagrelor tablets. In most cases, you should not take a dose of aspirin higher than 100 mg daily. Do not take doses of aspirin higher than what your healthcare provider tells you to take. Tell your healthcare provider if you take other medicines that contain aspirin, and do not take new over-the-counter medicines with aspirin in them. What are ticagrelor tablets? Ticagrelor tablets are a prescription medicine used to: \u2022 decrease your risk of a first heart attack or stroke in people who have a condition where the blood flow to the heart is decreased (coronary artery disease or CAD) who are at high risk for having a heart attack or stroke. \u2022 decrease your risk of stroke in people who are having a stroke (acute ischemic stroke) or mini-stroke (transient ischemic attack or TIA). It is not known if ticagrelor tablets are safe and effective in children. Do not take ticagrelor tablets if you: \u2022 have a history of bleeding in the brain \u2022 are bleeding now \u2022 are allergic to ticagrelor or any of the ingredients in ticagrelor tablets. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in ticagrelor tablets. Before taking ticagrelor tablets, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, if you: \u2022 have had bleeding problems in the past \u2022 have had any recent serious injury or surgery \u2022 plan to have surgery or a dental procedure. See \u201c What is the most important information I should know about ticagrelor tablets? \u201d \u2022 have a history of stomach ulcers or colon polyps \u2022 have lung or breathing problems, such as COPD or asthma \u2022 have liver problems \u2022 have a history of stroke \u2022 are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if ticagrelor tablets will harm your unborn baby. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will take ticagrelor tablets. \u2022 are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if ticagrelor passes into your breast milk. You should not breastfeed during treatment with ticagrelor tablets. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby during treatment with ticagrelor tablets. Tell all of your healthcare providers and dentists that you are taking ticagrelor tablets. They should talk to the healthcare provider who prescribed ticagrelor tablets for you before you have any surgery or procedure. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Ticagrelor tablets may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how ticagrelor tablets work. Certain medicines may increase your risk of bleeding. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take ticagrelor tablets? \u2022 Take ticagrelor tablets exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. \u2022 Your healthcare provider will tell you how many ticagrelor tablets to take and when to take them. \u2022 Take ticagrelor tablets with aspirin, unless your healthcare provider specifically tells you otherwise. See \u201c What is the most important information I should know about ticagrelor tablets? \u201d \u2022 You may take ticagrelor tablets with or without food. \u2022 Take ticagrelor tablets two times each day, around the same times each day. \u2022 If you miss your scheduled dose of ticagrelor tablets, take your next dose at its scheduled time. Do not take 2 doses at the same time unless your healthcare provider tells you to. \u2022 If you take too much ticagrelor tablets, call your healthcare provider or local poison control center or go to the nearest emergency room right away. If you are unable to swallow the tablet(s) whole , you may crush the ticagrelor tablet(s) and mix it with water. Drink all the water right away. Refill the glass with water, stir, and drink all the water. Ticagrelor tablets may also be given through certain nasogastric (NG) tubes. Ask your healthcare provider for instructions on how to take ticagrelor tablets through a NG tube. What are the possible side effects of ticagrelor tablets? Ticagrelor tablets can cause serious side effects, including: \u2022 See \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about ticagrelor tablets ?\u201d Shortness of breath . Tell your healthcare provider if you have new, worsening or unexpected shortness of breath when you are at rest, at night, or when you are doing any activity. Slow or irregular heartbeat . Irregular breathing . Tell your healthcare provider if you develop irregular breathing patterns when asleep or awake such as speeding up, slowing down or short pauses in breathing.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ticagrelor tablet is a P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor indicated \u2022 to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS. (1.1) \u2022 to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablet was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). (1.2) \u2022 to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). (1.3) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablet also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablet is indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablet was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor tablet is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 ACS or History of MI o Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. (2.2) \u2022 Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI o Administer 60 mg ticagrelor tablets twice daily. (2.3) \u2022 Acute Ischemic Stroke o Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. (2.4) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 to 100 mg. (2) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. (2.2) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablet to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Do not administer ticagrelor tablet with another oral P2Y12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablet. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablet, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablet twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablet twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablet with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablet based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14)]. 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablet twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor tablet with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14)]. 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablet and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Use ticagrelor tablet with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14)]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. (5.3) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. (5.5) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. (5.7) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea.

Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

P LATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. * 90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Figure 4 -Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe: Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. figure 1 figure 2 figure 3 figure 4 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications (4.3)] . Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. (7.1, 7.2) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. (7.3) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. (7.4) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. (7.4) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. (7.5) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD ( see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric use information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s BRILINTA\u00ae (ticagrelor) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Figure 5 \u2013 Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (\u00b1SE) following single oral doses of placebo, 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel Figure 6 \u2013 Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) following 6 weeks on placebo, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily Transitioning from clopidogrel to ticagrelor resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from ticagrelor to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . figure 5 figure 6 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1 to 4). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1 hour (range 1 to 4) for ticagrelor and 2 hours (range 1 to 8) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1 to 2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Effects of Ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity.

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1 to 4). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5 to 5). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30% to 42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80 to 125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1 hour (range 1 to 4) for ticagrelor and 2 hours (range 1 to 8) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9333) to clopidogrel (N=9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10 \u2013 Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.91; p =0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant ( p =0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p -values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs . planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs . bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 \u2013 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD 2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 to 325 mg then 75 to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). Table 10 -Incidences of the primary composite endpoint, primary composite endpoint components, and secondary endpoint (THALES) Ticagrelor N=5523 Placebo N=5493 HR(95% CI) p -value n (patients with event) KM% n (patients with event) KM% Time to first Stroke or Death 303 5.4% 362 6.5% 0.83 (0.71, 0.96) 0.015 Time to first Stroke * 284 5.1% 347 6.3% 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) Time to Death * 36 0.6% 27 0.5% 1.33 (0.81, 2.19) Secondary Endpoint Time to first Ischemic Stroke 276 5% 345 6.2% 0.79 (0.68, 0.93) 0.004 CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier percentage calculated at 30 days; N = Number of patients * The number of patients with the event of interest. In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor\u2019s treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%). figure 17 figure 18"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor is self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS > 5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of ticagrelor in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y12-receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea. ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Exelan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-604-3268 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Ticagrelor has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days. Table 1: Non-CABG related bleeds (PLATO) Ticagrelor* N=9235 Clopidogrel N=9186 n (%) patients with event n (%) patients with event PLATO Major + Minor 713 (7.7) 567 (6.2) Major 362 (3.9) 306 (3.3) Fatal/Life-threatening 171 (1.9) 151 (1.6) Fatal 15 (0.2) 16 (0.2) Intracranial hemorrhage (Fatal/Life-threatening) 26 (0.3) 15 (0.2) PLATO Minor bleed: requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding. PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. * 90 mg BID No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 \u2013 \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Other Adverse Reactions in PEGASUS Adverse reactions that occurred in PEGASUS at rates of 3% or more are shown in Table 5.

Figure 4: Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe : Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (eg, systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications (4.3) ]. Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Ticagrelor increases serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/ day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/ misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/ day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/ m2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in an adequate and well-controlled study conducted in 101 ticagrelor-treated pediatric patients, aged 2 to <18 for reducing the rate of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u226565 years of age and at least 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes.

Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without interruption of antiplatelet effect [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Figure 5. Figure 6. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers. Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median tmax of 1.5 h (range 1.0\u20134.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5-5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30%-42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max, but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80-125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 \u2013 4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 \u20138.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30-40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7 \u2013 Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor * Single dose of ticagrelor administered on a day without dialysis. ** Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Effects of Other Drugs on ticagrelor CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1-2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8 \u2013 Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor See Dosage and Administration (2) Effects of ticagrelor on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction PLATO PLATO ( NCT00391872 ) was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9333) to clopidogrel (N=9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75-100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non- fatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. Figure 10 \u2013 Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91; p =0.009). The results were similar for drug- eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant ( p =0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p -values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs . planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs . bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12 \u2013 CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study ( NCT01225562 ) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel- group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75- 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226550 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non- fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of ticagrelor 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14. Figure 14: Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 60 mg (PEGASUS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified.

Figure 10 Figure 11 Figure 12 Figure 13 Figure 14 14.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction THEMIS The THEMIS study ( NCT01991795 ) was a double-blind, parallel group, study in which 19,220 patients with CAD and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) but no history of MI or stroke were randomized to twice daily ticagrelor or placebo, on a background of 75-150 mg of aspirin. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

Figure 15 - Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (THEMIS) T=Ticagrelor; P=Placebo; N= Number of patients The treatment effect of ticagrelor appeared similar across patient subgroups, see Figure 16.

Figure 15 Figure 16 14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) THALES The THALES study ( NCT03354429 ) was a 11016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u226540 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u22645) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD2 score \u22656 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u226550% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300-325 mg then 75-100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR).

In the time to first stroke, patients who died are censored at the time of death. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death. Figure 17 \u2013 Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kalpan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor\u2019s treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18 \u2013 Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention- to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%).

( 1.3 ) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduce the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u2264 5) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 ACS or History of MI o Initiate treatment with 180 mg oral loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Then administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year. After one year, administer 60 mg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Patients with CAD and No Prior Stroke or MI o Administer 60 mg ticagrelor tablets twice daily. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Acute Ischemic Stroke o Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. ( 2.4 ) Use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg. ( 2 ) However, in patients who have undergone PCI, consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Instructions Advise patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor tablets to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, ticagrelor tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Do not administer ticagrelor tablets with another oral P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of ticagrelor tablets, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Initiate ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor tablets based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . 2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Administer 60 mg of ticagrelor tablets twice daily. Generally, use ticagrelor tablets with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . 2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor tablets and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days. Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Use ticagrelor tablets with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14) ] ."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor tablets than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor tablets is self-limiting. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor tablets increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS > 5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor tablets in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor Tablets in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor tablets must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart them as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor tablets for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor tablets as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor tablets developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor tablets, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor tablets without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor tablets can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor tablets patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor tablets have been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor tablets is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor tablets interference, ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT."

Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days. Table 1: Non-CABG related bleeds (PLATO) PLATO Minor bleed: requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding. PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days.

In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2: \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Figure 4: Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe : Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure < 90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor tablets and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor tablets and in 2 for placebo. Figure 4: Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor tablets (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor tablets 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor tablets 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor tablets than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine In PLATO, a > 50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor tablets 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by > 50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor tablets 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor tablets. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (< 2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see Contraindications (4.3) ]. Respiratory disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash"

Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. ( 7.3 ) \u2022 Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) \u2022 Rosuvastatin plasma concentrations may increase. Monitor for statin-related adverse effects. ( 7.4 ) \u2022 Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in ticagrelor tablets. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin Ticagrelor tablets increase serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Ticagrelor tablets increase serum concentration of rosuvastatin because rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.5 Digoxin Ticagrelor tablets inhibit the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in ticagrelor tablets therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ticagrelor tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in an adequate and well-controlled study conducted in 101 ticagrelor tablets-treated pediatric patients, aged 2 to < 18 for reducing the rate of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease. 8.5 Geriatric Use About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were \u2265 65 years of age and at least 15% were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with ticagrelor tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ticagrelor tablets did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES."

Treatment of overdose should follow local standard medical practice. Bleeding is the expected pharmacologic effect of overdosing. If bleeding occurs, appropriate supportive measures should be taken. Platelet transfusion did not reverse the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor tablets in healthy volunteers and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding. Other effects of overdose may include gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) or ventricular pauses. Monitor the ECG."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y 12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 \u03bcM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to ticagrelor tablets without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2) ].

Absorption Ticagrelor tablets can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 1.5 h (range 1.0-4.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t max of 2.5 h (range 1.5-5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30%-42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C max , but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C max of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. Ticagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C max within 80-125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t max of 1.0 hour (range 1.0-4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0-8.0) for AR-C124910XX. Distribution The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (> 99%). Metabolism CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30-40% of the exposure of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Excretion The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t 1/2 is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C max of ticagrelor tablets 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor tablets were administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that ticagrelor tablets are not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of ticagrelor tablets was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function. Figure 7: Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Figure 7: Impact of Intrinsic Factors on the Pharmacokinetics of Ticagrelor Effects of Other Drugs on Ticagrelor Tablets CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T max was delayed by 1-2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine. Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition. Figure 8: Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor Figure 7: Effect of Co-administered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Ticagrelor Effects of Ticagrelor Tablets on Other Drugs In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity.

The study\u2019s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. All patients randomized to ticagrelor tablets received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75-100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were > 65 years and 15% were > 75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO. Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.

Figure 10: Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, or stroke (PLATO) The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%). Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \u201cdefinite\u201d) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91; p = 0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents. A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below. Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Figure 11: Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Regional Differences Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant ( p = 0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p -values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome. Aspirin Dose The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor tablets when used with low maintenance doses (\u2264 100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose. Figure 12: CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO) Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor tablets. Figure 12: CV Death, MI, Stroke by Maintenance Aspirin Dose in the U.S. and Outside the U.S. (PLATO) Figure 10: Time to First Occurrence of CV Death, MI, or Stroke (PLATO) Figure 11: Subgroup analyses of (PLATO) PEGASUS The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562) was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75-150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age \u2265 65 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Figure 13: Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS) Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor tablets in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor tablets plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea. Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

The treatment effect of ticagrelor tablets 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14. Figure 14: Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 60 mg (PEGASUS) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified.

The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of \u2265 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. Ticagrelor tablets were superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.

The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. Patients were eligible to participate if they were \u2265 40 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score \u2264 5) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD2 score \u2265 6 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis \u2265 50% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor tablets (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300-325 mg then 75-100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. Ticagrelor tablets were superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR).

Figure 17: Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES) KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T=Ticagrelor; P=placebo; N=Number of patients Ticagrelor tablet\u2019s treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk. The treatment effect of ticagrelor tablets was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18). Figure 18: Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES) Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention- to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%).
