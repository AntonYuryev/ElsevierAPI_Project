      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Flurazepam hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and/or early morning awakenings [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ]. Since insomnia is often transient and intermittent, short-term use is usually sufficient. Prolonged use of hypnotics is usually not indicated and should only be undertaken concomitantly with appropriate evaluation of the patient. Flurazepam, a gamma-aminobutyric (GABA A ) agonist, is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and/or early morning awakenings.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest dose effective for the patient. Recommended initial dose is 15 mg for women and 15 mg or 30 mg for men. ( 2.1 ) Elderly or debilitated patients: recommended dose is 15 mg. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosage in Adults Use the lowest dose effective for the patient, as important adverse effects of flurazepam hydrochloride capsules are dose related. The recommended initial dose is 15 mg for women and either 15 mg or 30 mg for men. The 15 mg dose can be increased to 30 mg if necessary for efficacy. The recommended initial doses for women and men are different because flurazepam clearance is lower in women [see Pharmacokinetics ( 12.3 ) ]. 2.2 Dosage in Elderly or Debilitated Patients Elderly or debilitated patients may be especially sensitive to flurazepam. Since the risk of the development of oversedation, dizziness, confusion and/or ataxia increases substantially with larger doses in elderly or debilitated patients, it is recommended that in such patients the dosage be limited to 15 mg. Staggering and falling have also been reported, particularly in geriatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. 2.3 Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Flurazepam Hydrochloride Capsules To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue flurazepam hydrochloride capsules or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS CNS depressant effects: Impaired alertness and motor coordination, including risk of falling. Daytime impairment. Caution patients against driving and other activities requiring complete mental alertness. ( 5.4 ) The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. ( 5.5 ) Severe anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions: Angioedema and anaphylaxis have been reported. Do not rechallenge if such reactions occur. ( 5.6 ) Sleep driving and other complex behaviors while not fully awake: Risk increases with dose and concomitant CNS depressants and alcohol. Immediately evaluate any new onset behavioral changes. ( 5.7 ) Worsening of depression or suicidal thinking may occur: Prescribe the least number of capsules feasible to avoid intentional overdose. ( 5.8 ) Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome: Flurazepam use during pregnancy can result in neonatal sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Risks from Concomitant Use of Opioids Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including flurazepam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe flurazepam concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when flurazepam is used with opioids [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.2 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction The use of benzodiazepines, including flurazepam hydrochloride capsules, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.2 ) ]. Before prescribing flurazepam hydrochloride capsules and throughout treatment, assess each patient\u2019s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of flurazepam hydrochloride capsules, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of flurazepam hydrochloride capsules along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate. 5.3 Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue flurazepam hydrochloride capsules or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use. Acute Withdrawal Reactions: The continued use of benzodiazepines, including flurazepam hydrochloride capsules, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of flurazepam hydrochloride capsules after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ]. Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome: In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ]. 5.4 CNS-Depressant Effects and Next-Day Impairment Dizziness, drowsiness, light-headedness, staggering, ataxia and falling can occur, particularly in elderly or debilitated persons. Severe sedation, lethargy, disorientation and coma, probably indicative of drug intolerance or overdosage, have been reported. Flurazepam is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant and can impair daytime function even when used as prescribed. Prescribers should monitor for excess depressant effects, but impairment can occur in the absence of subjective symptoms, and may not be reliably detected by ordinary clinical exam (i.e., less than formal psychomotor testing). While pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some adverse depressant effects of flurazepam may develop, patients using flurazepam should be cautioned against driving or engaging in other hazardous activities or activities requiring complete mental alertness. Additive effects occur with concomitant use of other CNS depressants (e.g., other benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol). Downward dose adjustment of flurazepam and concomitant CNS depressants should be considered. The potential for adverse drug interactions continues for several days following discontinuation of flurazepam, until serum levels of psychoactive metabolites decline. Use of flurazepam with other sedative-hypnotics is not recommended. Alcohol generally should not be used during treatment with flurazepam. The risk of next-day psychomotor impairment is increased if flurazepam is taken with less than a full night of sleep remaining (7 to 8 hours); if higher than the recommended dose is taken; if coadministered with other CNS depressants [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Because flurazepam can cause drowsiness and a decreased level of consciousness, patients, particularly the elderly, are at higher risk of falls. 5.5 Need to Evaluate for Co-morbid Disorders Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative-hypnotic drugs. 5.6 Severe Anaphylactic or Anaphylactoid Reactions Rare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including flurazepam. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with flurazepam should not be rechallenged with the drug. 5.7 Abnormal Thinking and Behavior Changes Abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported in patients treated with sedative-hypnotics including flurazepam. Some of these changes include decreased inhibition (e.g., aggressiveness and extroversion that seemed out of character), bizarre behavior, and depersonalization. Visual and auditory hallucinations have also been reported. Amnesia, and other neuro-psychiatric symptoms, may occur. Paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, agitation, increased muscle spasticity, and sleep disturbances may occur unpredictably. Complex behaviors such as \u201csleep-driving\u201d (i.e., driving while not fully awake, with amnesia for the event) have been reported with use of sedative-hypnotics. These behaviors can occur with initial treatment or in patients previously tolerant of flurazepam or other sedative-hypnotics. Although these behaviors can occur with use at therapeutic doses, risk is increased by higher doses or concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS depressants. Due to risk to the patient and community, flurazepam should be discontinued if \u201csleep-driving\u201d occurs. Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events. 5.8 Worsening of Depression Benzodiazepines may worsen depression. Consequently, appropriate precautions (e.g., limiting the total prescription size and increased monitoring for suicidal ideation) should be considered. 5.9 Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome Use of flurazepam late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Monitor neonates exposed to flurazepam during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to flurazepam during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these neonates accordingly."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. ( 7.1 ) CNS Depressants: Downward dose adjustment may be necessary due to additive effects. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Opioids The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABA A sites, and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation. 7.2 CNS Depressants Benzodiazepines, including flurazepam, produce additive CNS depressant effects when co-administered with ethanol or other CNS depressants (e.g., psychotropic medications, anticonvulsants, antihistamines). Downward dose adjustment of flurazepam and/or concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary because of additive effects."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry: There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to psychiatric medications, including flurazepam, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/pregnancyregistry/ . Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to flurazepam during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to HALCION during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )]. Data Human Data Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these findings. Animal Data Administration of flurazepam to pregnant animals did not indicate a risk for adverse effects on morphological development at clinically relevant doses; however, animal data for other benzodiazepines suggest that possibility of adverse developmental effects (including long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function) following prenatal exposure. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of flurazepam in human or animal milk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. The effects of flurazepam on milk production are unknown. Because of the flurazepam\u2019s long half-life, the potential for flurazepam to accumulate in breast milk, and the potential for serious adverse reactions, including sedation and withdrawal symptoms in breastfed infants, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with flurazepam. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Flurazepam may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly. Elderly patients generally should be started on a low dose of flurazepam and observed closely. Elderly or debilitated patients may be more sensitive to benzodiazepines, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Flurazepam is a Schedule IV controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Flurazepam hydrochloride capsules are a benzodiazepine and a CNS depressant with a potential for abuse and addiction. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Even taking benzodiazepines as prescribed may put patients at risk for abuse and misuse of their medication. Abuse and misuse may lead to addiction. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Benzodiazepines are often sought by individuals who abuse drugs and other substances, and by individuals with addictive disorders [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The following adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: abdominal pain, amnesia, anorexia, anxiety, aggression, ataxia, blurred vision, confusion, depression, disinhibition, disorientation, dizziness, euphoria, impaired concentration and memory, indigestion, irritability, muscle pain, slurred speech, tremors, and vertigo. The following severe adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: delirium, paranoia, suicidal ideation and behavior, seizures, coma, breathing difficulty, and death. Death is more often associated with polysubstance use (especially benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants such as opioids and alcohol) . 9.3 Dependence Physical Dependence: Flurazepam hydrochloride capsules may produce physical dependence from continued therapy. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of benzodiazepines or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life- threatening. Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e., higher and/or more frequent doses) and those who have had longer durations of use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue flurazepam hydrochloride capsules or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Acute Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms: Acute withdrawal signs and symptoms associated with benzodiazepines have included abnormal involuntary movements, anxiety, blurred vision, depersonalization, depression, derealization, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal adverse reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, decreased appetite), headache, hyperacusis, hypertension, irritability, insomnia, memory impairment, muscle pain and stiffness, panic attacks, photophobia, restlessness, tachycardia, and tremor. More severe acute withdrawal signs and symptoms, including life-threatening reactions, have included catatonia, convulsions, delirium tremens, depression, hallucinations, mania, psychosis, seizures, and suicidality. Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome: Protracted withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines is characterized by anxiety, cognitive impairment, depression, insomnia, formication, motor symptoms (e.g., weakness, tremor, muscle twitches), paresthesia, and tinnitus that persists beyond 4 to 6 weeks after initial benzodiazepine withdrawal. Protracted withdrawal symptoms may last weeks to more than 12 months . As a result, there may be difficulty in differentiating withdrawal symptoms from potential re-emergence or continuation of symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was being used. Tolerance: Tolerance to flurazepam hydrochloride capsules may develop from continued therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance to the therapeutic effect of flurazepam hydrochloride capsules may develop; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage. In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway management. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with flumazenil use may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., status epilepticus). If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage. See the flumazenil injection Prescribing Information. Consider contacting a poison center (1-800-222-1222), poisoncontrol.org , or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Flurazepam, like other central nervous system agents of the 1,4-benzodiazepine class, presumably exerts its effects by binding to stereo-specific receptors at several sites within the central nervous system (CNS). The exact mechanism of action is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Flurazepam hydrochloride is rapidly absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract. Flurazepam is rapidly metabolized and is excreted primarily in the urine. Following a single oral dose, peak flurazepam plasma concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 ng/mL occur at 30 to 60 minutes post-dosing. The harmonic mean apparent half-life of flurazepam is 2.3 hours. The blood level profile of flurazepam and its major metabolites was determined in man following the oral administration of 30 mg daily for 2 weeks. The N1-hydroxyethyl-flurazepam was measurable only during the early hours after a 30 mg dose and was not detectable after 24 hours. The major metabolite in blood was N1-desalkyl-flurazepam, which reached steady-state (plateau) levels after 7 to 10 days of dosing, at levels approximately 5- to 6-fold greater than the 24-hour levels observed on Day 1. The half-life of elimination of N1-desalkyl-flurazepam ranged from 47 to 100 hours. The major urinary metabolite is conjugated N1-hydroxyethyl-flurazepam which accounts for 22% to 55% of the dose. Less than 1% of the dose is excreted in the urine as N1-desalkyl-flurazepam. This pharmacokinetic profile may be responsible for the clinical observation that flurazepam is increasingly effective on the second or third night of consecutive use and that for 1 or 2 nights after the drug is discontinued both sleep latency and total wake time may still be decreased. The single dose pharmacokinetics of flurazepam were studied in 12 healthy geriatric subjects (aged 61 to 85 years). The mean elimination half-life of desalkyl-flurazepam was longer in elderly male subjects (160 hours) compared with younger male subjects (74 hours), while mean elimination half-life was similar in geriatric female subjects (120 hours) and younger female subjects (90 hours). After multiple dosing, mean steady-state plasma levels of desalkyl-flurazepam were higher in elderly male subjects (81 ng/mL) compared with younger male subjects (53 ng/mL), while values were similar between elderly female subjects (85 ng/mL) and younger female subjects (86 ng/mL). The mean washout half-life of desalkyl-flurazepam was longer in elderly male and female subjects (126 and 158 hours, respectively) compared with younger male and female subjects (111 and 113 hours, respectively). 1 1 Greenblatt DJ, Divoll M, Hammatz JS, MacLauglin DS, Shader RI: Kinetics and clinical effects of flurazepam in young and elderly noninsomniacs.
