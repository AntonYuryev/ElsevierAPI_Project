      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Apply a thin layer of tazarotene cream only to the affected area once daily in the evening. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. ( 2.2 ) If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Tazarotene cream is for topical use only. Tazarotene cream is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. If contact with mucous membranes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water [see Warnings and Precaution ( 5.2) ] . Wash hands thoroughly after application. 2.2 Psoriasis Apply a thin film (2 mg/cm 2 ) of tazarotene cream 0.1% once per day, in the evening, to cover only the psoriatic lesions. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the cream. If emollients are used, they should be applied at least an hour before application of tazarotene cream. Because unaffected skin may be more susceptible to irritation, application of tazarotene cream to these areas should be carefully avoided. 2.3 Acne Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer (2 mg/cm 2 ) of tazarotene cream 0.1% once per day, in the evening, to the skin areas where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affected area. Use effective sunscreens and wear protective clothing while using tazarotene cream [see Warnings and Precaution ( 5.3) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryofetal Toxicity: Tazarotene cream contains tazarotene, which is a teratogenic substance. Tazarotene cream is contraindicated in pregnancy. Females of child-bearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment and use an effective method of contraception during treatment. ( 5.1 ) Local Irritation: Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling. If these effects occur, discontinue until the integrity of the skin has been restored, or reduce dosing interval, or in the case of psoriasis, may switch to the lower concentration. Tazarotene cream should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. ( 5.2 ) Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. Tazarotene cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in orally treated animals. Although there may be less systemic exposure in the treatment of acne of the face alone due to less surface area for application, tazarotene is a teratogenic substance, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ] . There were thirteen reported pregnancies in subjects who participated in the clinical trials for topical tazarotene. Nine of the subjects were found to have been treated with topical tazarotene, and the other four had been treated with vehicle. One of the subjects who was treated with tazarotene cream elected to terminate the pregnancy for non-medical reasons unrelated to treatment. The other eight pregnant women who were inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during clinical trials subsequently delivered apparently healthy babies. As the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation times are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. Females of Child-bearing Potential Females of child-bearing potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when tazarotene cream is used. The possibility that a female of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. A negative result for pregnancy test should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to tazarotene cream therapy. Tazarotene cream therapy should begin during a menstrual period [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1) ] . 5.2 Local Irritation and Hypersensitivity Reactions Local tolerability reactions (including blistering and skin desquamation) and hypersensitivity adverse reactions (including urticaria) have been observed with topical tazarotene. Application of tazarotene cream may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive individuals. Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling. If these effects occur, the medication should either be discontinued until the integrity of the skin is restored, or the dosing should be reduced to an interval the patient can tolerate. However, efficacy at reduced frequency of application has not been established. Alternatively, patients with psoriasis who are being treated with the 0.1% concentration can be switched to the lower concentration. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Therapy can be resumed, or the drug concentration or frequency of application can be increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate treatment. Concomitant topical medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tazarotene cream is begun. Tazarotene cream, should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using tazarotene cream. 5.3 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of tazarotene cream. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using tazarotene cream. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use tazarotene cream until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using tazarotene cream. Tazarotene cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Embryofetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) ] Photosensitivity and Risk of Sunburn [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3) ] Plaque psoriasis: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 23% of patients are pruritus, erythema, and burning. ( 6.1 ) Acne Vulgaris: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 30% of patients are desquamation, dry skin, erythema, and burning sensation. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cosette Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-922-1038 or contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In human dermal safety trials, tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% did not induce allergic contact sensitization, phototoxicity, or photoallergy. Psoriasis The most frequent adverse reactions reported with tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% occurring in 10 to 23% of subjects, in descending order, included pruritus, erythema, and burning. Reactions occurring in greater than 1 to less than 10% of subjects, in descending order, included irritation, desquamation, stinging, contact dermatitis, dermatitis, eczema, worsening of psoriasis, skin pain, rash, hypertriglyceridemia, dry skin, skin inflammation, and peripheral edema. Tazarotene cream, 0.1% was associated with a greater degree of local irritation than the 0.05% cream. The rates of irritation adverse reactions reported during psoriasis trials with tazarotene cream, 0.1% were 0.1 to 0.4% higher than those reported for tazarotene cream, 0.05%. Acne The most frequent adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with tazarotene cream, 0.1% in the treatment of acne, occurring in 10 to 30% of subjects, in descending order included desquamation, dry skin, erythema, and burning sensation. Reactions occurring in 1 to 5% of subjects included pruritus, irritation, face pain, and stinging. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tazarotene. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : blister, dermatitis, urticaria, skin exfoliation, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), swelling at or near application sites, and pain."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from tazarotene cream during pregnancy; therefore, tazarotene cream should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [see Contraindications ( 4) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]. Limited case reports of pregnancy in females enrolled in clinical trials for tazarotene cream have not established a clear association with tazarotene and major birth defects or miscarriage risk. Because the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestational age are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown . In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed topically during organogenesis at 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits dosed topically with tazarotene gel at 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, there was a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, tazarotene dosed orally during organogenesis at 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays . In pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed orally prior to mating through early gestation resulted in decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations at doses approximately 7 times higher than the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% [see Data ]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In rats, a tazarotene gel, 0.05% formulation dosed topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day, which represented 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% (i.e . , 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area), resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel, which represented 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, during gestation days 6 through 18, had a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats, and malformations and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses representing 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%. In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, classic developmental effects of retinoids were observed including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at that dose. In a pre-and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of tazarotene gel (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival, but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the maximum systemic exposure in the rat would be equivalent to the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of tazarotene in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. After single topical doses of 14 C-tazarotene gel to the skin of lactating rats, radioactivity was detected in rat milk. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of tazarotene cream to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tazarotene cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tazarotene cream or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating tazarotene cream therapy which should begin during a menstrual period. Contraception Females Based on animal studies, tazarotene cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tazarotene cream. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tazarotene cream have not been established in patients with psoriasis under the age of 18 years, or in patients with acne under the age of 12 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tazarotene cream for the treatment of acne has not been clinically tested in persons 65 years of age or older. Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials of tazarotene cream for plaque psoriasis, 120 were over the age of 65. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Currently there is no other clinical experience on the differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1 RAR\u03b2, and RAR \u03b3 , but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2, and RAR \u03b3 and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Little parent compound could be detected in the plasma. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. The half-life of tazarotenic acid was approximately 18 hours, following topical application of tazarotene to normal, acne or psoriatic skin. In a multiple dose trial with a once daily dose for 14 consecutive days in 9 psoriatic subjects (male=5; female=4), measured doses of tazarotene cream, 0.1% were applied by medical staff to involved skin without occlusion (5 to 35% of total body surface area: mean \u00b1 SD: 14 \u00b1 11%). The C max of tazarotenic acid was 2.31 \u00b1 2.78 ng/mL occurring 8 hours after the final dose, and the AUC 0-24h was 31.2 \u00b1 35.2 ng\u2219hr/mL on day 15 in the five subjects who were administered clinical doses of 2 mg cream/cm 2 . During clinical trials with tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% treatment for plaque psoriasis, three out of 139 subjects with their systemic exposure monitored had detectable plasma tazarotene concentrations, with the highest value at 0.09 ng/mL. Tazarotenic acid was detected in 78 out of 139 subjects (LLOQ = 0.05 ng/mL). Three subjects using tazarotene cream 0.1% had plasma tazarotenic acid concentrations greater than 1 ng/mL. The highest value was 2.4 ng/mL. However, because of the variations in the time of blood sampling, the area of psoriasis involvement, and the dose of tazarotene applied, actual maximal plasma levels are unknown. Tazarotene cream 0.1% was applied once daily to either the face (N=8) or to 15% of body surface area (N=10) of female subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris. The mean C max and AUC values of tazarotenic acid peaked at day 15 for both dosing groups during a 29 day treatment period. Mean C max and AUC 0-24h values of tazarotenic acid from subjects in the 15% body surface area dosing group were more than 10 times higher than those from subjects in the face-only dosing group. The single highest C max throughout the trial period was 1.91 ng/mL on day 15 in the exaggerated dosing group. In the face-only group, the mean \u00b1 SD values of C max and AUC 0-24h of tazarotenic acid on day 15 were 0.10 \u00b1 0.06 ng/mL and 1.54 \u00b1 1.01 ng\u2219hr/mL, respectively, whereas in the 15% body surface area dosing group, the mean \u00b1 SD values of C max and AUC 0-24h of tazarotenic acid on day 15 were 1.20 \u00b1 0.41 ng/mL and 17.01 \u00b1 6.15 ng\u2219hr/mL, respectively. The steady state pharmacokinetics of tazarotenic acid had been reached by day 8 in the face-only and by day 15 in the 15% body surface area dosing groups. In a Phase 3 clinical trial, tazarotene cream, 0.1% was applied once daily for 12 weeks to each of 48 subjects (22 females and 26 males) with facial acne vulgaris. The mean \u00b1 SD values of plasma tazarotenic acid at weeks 4 and 8 were 0.078 \u00b1 0.073 ng/mL (N=47) and 0.052 \u00b1 0.037 ng/mL (N=42), respectively. The highest observed individual plasma tazarotenic acid concentration was 0.41 ng/mL at week 4 from a female subject. The magnitude of plasma tazarotenic acid concentrations appears to be independent of gender, age, and body weight."

In the face-only group, the mean \u00b1 SD values of C max and AUC 0-24h of tazarotenic acid on day 15 were 0.10 \u00b1 0.06 ng/mL and 1.54 \u00b1 1.01 ng\u2219hr/mL, respectively, whereas in the 15% body surface area dosing group, the mean \u00b1 SD values of C max and AUC 0-24h of tazarotenic acid on day 15 were 1.20 \u00b1 0.41 ng/mL and 17.01 \u00b1 6.15 ng\u2219hr/mL, respectively. The steady state pharmacokinetics of tazarotenic acid had been reached by day 8 in the face-only and by day 15 in the 15% body surface area dosing groups. In a Phase 3 clinical trial, tazarotene cream, 0.1% was applied once daily for 12 weeks to each of 48 subjects (22 females and 26 males) with facial acne vulgaris. The mean \u00b1 SD values of plasma tazarotenic acid at weeks 4 and 8 were 0.078 \u00b1 0.073 ng/mL (N=47) and 0.052 \u00b1 0.037 ng/mL (N=42), respectively. The highest observed individual plasma tazarotenic acid concentration was 0.41 ng/mL at week 4 from a female subject. The magnitude of plasma tazarotenic acid concentrations appears to be independent of gender, age, and body weight."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis A long-term study of tazarotene following oral administration of 0.025, 0.050, and 0.125 mg/kg/day to rats showed no indications of increased carcinogenic risks. Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in the rat equivalent to 0.6 times that seen in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/kg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study. This estimated systemic exposure in rats was 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area. A long-term topical application study of up to 0.1% of tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice terminated at 88 weeks showed that dose levels of 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared to vehicle control animals. Systemic exposures at the highest dose was 3.9 times that seen in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study, and 13 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area. In evaluation of photo co-carcinogenicity, median time to onset of tumors was decreased, and the number of tumors increased in hairless mice following chronic topical dosing with intercurrent exposure to ultraviolet radiation at tazarotene concentrations of 0.001%, 0.005%, and 0.01% in a gel formulation for up to 40 weeks. Mutagenesis Tazarotene was found to be non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in a human lymphocyte assay. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility No impairment of fertility occurred in rats when male animals were treated for 70 days prior to mating and female animals were treated for 14 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation with topical doses of tazarotene gel up to 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat would be equivalent to 0.6 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study, and 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in male rats treated for 70 days prior to mating with oral doses of up to 1 mg/kg/day tazarotene. That dose produced a systemic exposure that was 1.9 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area, and 6.3 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in female rats treated for 15 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation day 7 with oral doses up to 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of estrous stages and an increase in developmental effects at that dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1) ] . That dose produced a systemic exposure that was 3.4 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area and 11 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area. Reproductive capabilities of F1 animals, including F2 survival and development, were not affected by topical administration of tazarotene gel to female F0 parental rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 at the maximum tolerated dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat would be equivalent to 0.6 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area, and 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In two 12-week vehicle-controlled clinical trials, tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% was significantly more effective than vehicle in reducing the severity of stable plaque psoriasis. Tazarotene cream 0.05% and 0.1% demonstrated superiority over vehicle cream as early as 1 week and 2 weeks, respectively, after starting treatment. In these trials, the primary efficacy endpoint was \"clinical success,\" defined as the proportion of subjects with none, minimal, or mild overall lesional assessment at Week 12, and shown in Table 1. \"Clinical success\" was also significantly greater with tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% versus vehicle at most follow-up visits.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information). Embryofetal Toxicity Inform females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise these patients to use effective contraception during treatment with tazarotene cream. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] . Photosensitivity and Risk of Sunburn Advise patients to avoid excessive sun exposure and to use of sunscreens and protective measures (hat, visor). Advise patients to avoid using tazarotene if also taking other medicines may increase sensitivity to sunlight. Important Administration Instructions Advise the patient of the following: 1. For the patient with psoriasis, apply tazarotene cream only to psoriasis skin lesions, avoiding uninvolved skin. 2. If undue irritation (redness, peeling, or discomfort) occurs, reduce frequency of application or temporarily interrupt treatment. Treatment may be resumed once irritation subsides [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 3. Moisturizers may be used as frequently as desired. 4. Patients with psoriasis may use a cream or lotion to soften or moisten skin at least 1 hour before applying tazarotene cream. 5. Avoid contact with the eyes. If tazarotene cream gets in or near eyes, rinse thoroughly with water. Seek medical attention if eye irritation continues. 6. Tazarotene cream is for topical use only. Do not apply to eyes, mouth, or other mucous membrane. Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. 7. Wash hands thoroughly after applying tazarotene cream."

Tazarotene elicits teratogenic and developmental effects associated with retinoids after topical or systemic administration in rats and rabbits [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, treatment should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]. Pregnancy. ( 4 , 8.1 )"
    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fetal Risk: Tazarotene Foam contains tazarotene, which is a teratogenic substance. Tazarotene Foam is contraindicated in pregnancy. Females of childbearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment and use an effective method of contraception during treatment. ( 5.1 ) Local Irritation: Use with caution in patients with a history of local tolerability reactions or local hypersensitivity. ( 5.2 ) Potential Irritant Effect with Concomitant Topical Medications: Use with caution because a cumulative irritant effect may occur. ( 5.3 ) Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. ( 5.4 ) Contents are flammable. Instruct the patient to avoid fire, flame, and smoking during and immediately following application. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Fetal Risk Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in orally treated animals. Tazarotene is a teratogenic substance, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ] . There were 5 reported pregnancies in subjects who participated in clinical trials for topical tazarotene foam. One of the subjects was found to have been treated with topical tazarotene for 25 days, 2 were treated with vehicle foam, and the other 2 did not receive either tazarotene foam or vehicle foam. The subjects were discontinued from the trials when their pregnancy was reported. The one pregnant woman who was inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during the clinical trial delivered a full-term healthy infant. Females of Childbearing Potential: Females of child-bearing potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when tazarotene foam is used. The possibility of pregnancy should be considered in females of child-bearing potential at the time of institution of therapy. A negative serum or urine result for pregnancy test having a sensitivity down to at least 25 mIU/mL for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to therapy with Tazarotene Foam, which should begin during a normal menstrual period for females of childbearing potential. Advise patients of the need to use an effective method of contraception to avoid pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] . 5.2 Local Irritation Tazarotene Foam should be used with caution in patients with a history of local tolerability reactions or local hypersensitivity. Retinoids should not be used on abraded or eczematous skin, as they may cause severe irritation. Contact with the mouth, eyes, and mucous membranes should be avoided. In case of accidental contact, rinse well with water. Some individuals may experience skin redness, peeling, burning or excessive pruritus. If these effects occur, the medication should either be discontinued until the integrity of the skin is restored, or the dosing should be reduced to an interval the patient can tolerate. However, efficacy at reduced frequency of application has not been established. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using Tazarotene Foam. 5.3 Potential Irritant Effect with Concomitant Topical Medications Concomitant topical acne therapy should be used with caution because a cumulative irritant effect may occur. If irritancy or dermatitis occurs, reduce frequency of application or temporarily interrupt treatment and resume once the irritation subsides. Treatment should be discontinued if the irritation persists. 5.4 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using Tazarotene Foam. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use Tazarotene Foam until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using Tazarotene Foam and ensure that the precautions are observed [see FDA-approved patient labeling]. Due to the potential for photosensitivity resulting in greater risk for sunburn, Tazarotene Foam should be used with caution in patients with a personal or family history of skin cancer. Tazarotene Foam should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity. 5.5 Flammability The propellant in Tazarotene Foam is flammable. Instruct the patient to avoid fire, flame, and/or smoking during and immediately following application."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Tazarotene Foam. Concomitant dermatologic medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is recommended to postpone treatment until the effects of these products subside before use of Tazarotene Foam is started. Concomitant use with oxidizing agents, such as benzoyl peroxide, may cause degradation of tazarotene and may reduce the clinical efficacy of tazarotene. If combination therapy is required, they should be applied at different times of the day (e.g., one in the morning and the other in the evening). The impact of tazarotene on the pharmacokinetics of progestin-only oral contraceptives (i.e., minipills) has not been evaluated. In a trial of 27 healthy female subjects between the ages of 20 to 55 years receiving a combination oral contraceptive tablet containing 1 mg norethindrone and 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol, concomitant use of tazarotene did not affect the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol over a complete cycle. Avoid concomitant dermatologic medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect. ( 7 )"

In rats, tazarotene 0.05% gel administered topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel during gestation days 6 through 18 were noted with single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. Systemic exposure (AUC) to tazarotenic acid at topical doses of 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene in a gel formulation in rats and rabbits were 15 to 166 times, respectively, the AUC in acne patients treated with 2 mg/cm 2 of Tazarotene Foam 0.1% over a 15% body surface acrea. A with other retinoids, when tazarotene was administered orally to experimental animals, developmental delays were seen in rats, and teratogenic effects and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses 13 and 325 times, respectively, the AUC to tazarotenic acid in acne patients treated with 2 mg/cm 2 of Tazarotene Foam 0.1% over a 15% body surface area. In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, a number of classic developmental effects of retinoids were observed including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was also observed. AUC in rats was 42 times the AUC in acne patients treated with 2 mg/cm 2 of Tazarotene Foam 0.1% over a 15% body surface area. 8.3 Nursing Mothers After single topical doses of 14 C-tazarotene to the skin of lactating rats, radioactivity was detected in milk, suggesting that there would be transfer of drug-related material to the offspring via milk. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. The safe use of Tazarotene Foam during lactation has not been established. A decision should be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue therapy with Tazarotene Foam taking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Tazarotene Foam in pediatric patients younger than 12 years have not been established.

Tazarotenic acid binds to all 3 members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3 but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2 and RAR\u03b3 and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. The mechanism of tazarotene action in acne vulgaris is not defined. However, the basis of tazarotene's therapeutic effect in acne may be due to its anti-hyperproliferative, normalizing-of-differentiation and anti-inflammatory effects. Tazarotene inhibited corneocyte accumulation in rhino mouse skin and cross- linked envelope formation in cultured human keratinocytes. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of Tazarotene Foam are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones, and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. Systemic exposure following topical application of Tazarotene Foam 0.1% was evaluated in one trial. Patients aged 15 years and older with moderate-to-severe acne applied approximately 3.7 grams of Tazarotene Foam 0.1% (N = 13) to approximately 15% body surface area (face, upper chest, upper back, and shoulders) once daily for 22 days. On Day 22, the mean (\u00b1SD) tazarotenic acid C max was 0.43 (\u00b10.19) ng/mL, the AUC 0 - 24h was 6.98 (\u00b13.56) ng\u2219h/mL, and the half-life was 21.7 (\u00b115.7) hours. The median T max was 6 hours (range: 4.4 to 12 hours). The AUC 0-24h for tazarotenic acid was approximately 50-fold higher compared with the parent compound tazarotene. The mean (\u00b1SD) half-life of tazarotene was 8.1 (\u00b13.7) hours. Accumulation was observed upon repeated once-daily dosing as the tazarotenic acid predose concentrations were measurable in the majority of subjects. Steady state was attained within 22 days of daily application. Once-daily dosing resulted in little to no accumulation of tazarotene as predose concentrations were mostly below the quantitation limit throughout the study."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis: A long-term study of tazarotene following oral administration of 0.025, 0.050, and 0.125 mg/kg/day to rats showed no indications of increased carcinogenic risk. Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter-term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in rats approximately 2 times the AUC in acne patients treated with 2 mg/cm 2 of Tazarotene Foam 0.1% over a 15% body surface area. A long-term topical application study of up to 0.1% tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice terminated at 88 weeks showed that dose levels of 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared with vehicle control animals. AUC at the highest dose in mice was 49 times the AUC in acne patients treated with 2 mg/cm 2 of Tazarotene Foam 0.1% over a 15% body surface area. In evaluation of photocarcinogenicity, median time to onset of tumors was decreased and the number of tumors increased in hairless mice following chronic topical dosing with exposure to ultraviolet radiation at tazarotene concentrations of 0.001%, 0.005%, and 0.01% in a gel formulation for up to 40 weeks. Mutagenesis: Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in a human lymphocyte assay. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility: No impairment of fertility was observed in rats when male animals were treated for 70 days prior to mating and female animals were treated for 14 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation with topical doses of tazarotene gel up to 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure at the 0.125 mg/kg/day dose in rats would be equivalent to 7.6 times the AUC in acne patients treated with 2 mg/cm 2 of Tazarotene Foam 0.1% over a 15% body surface area. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in male rats treated for 70 days prior to mating with oral doses of up to 1 mg/kg/day tazarotene. AUC at the highest dose in rats was 23 times the AUC in acne patients treated with 2 mg/cm 2 of Tazarotene Foam 0.1% over a 15% body surface area. No effect on parameters of mating performance or fertility was observed in female rats treated for 15 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation day 7 with oral doses of tazarotene up to 2 mg/kg/day. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of estrous stages and an increase in developmental effects at that dose [see Pregnancy (8.1) ]. AUC at the highest dose in rats was 42 times the AUC in acne patients treated with 2 mg/cm 2 of Tazarotene Foam 0.1% over a 15% body surface area. Reproductive capabilities of F1 animals, including F2 survival and development, were not affected by topical administration of tazarotene gel to female F0 parental rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 at the maximum tolerated dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the AUC in rats would be equivalent to 7.6 times the AUC in acne patients treated with 2 mg/cm 2 of Tazarotene Foam 0.1% over a 15% body surface area."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In 2 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials, a total of 1,485 subjects with moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris were randomized 1:1 to Tazarotene Foam or vehicle applied once daily for 12 weeks. Acne severity was evaluated using lesion counts and the 6-point Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale (see Table 2 ). At baseline, 80% of subjects were graded as \"moderate\" or Grade 3 and 20% were graded as \"severe\" or Grade 4 on the IGA scale. At baseline, subjects had an average of 79.8 total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory lesions was 31.9 and the mean number of non-inflammatory lesions was 47.8. Subjects ranged in age from 12 to 45 years, with 860 (58%) subjects aged 12 to 17 years; 428 (29%) subjects aged 18 to 25 years; 143 (10%) subjects aged 26 to 35 years and 54 (4%) subjects aged 36 to 45 years. Subjects enrolled in the trials by race were white (77%), black (15%), Asian (4%), and other (4%). Hispanics comprised 18% of the population. An equal number of males (49%) and females (51%) were enrolled. Treatment success was defined as a score of \"clear\" (Grade 0) or \"almost clear\" (Grade 1) and at least 2-grade improvement from the baseline score to Week 12. Table 2. Investigator's Global Assessment Scale Grade Description 0 Clear Clear skin with no inflammatory or non-inflammatory lesions. 1 Almost clear Rare non-inflammatory lesions with no more than rare papules. 2 Mild Greater than Grade 1, some non-inflammatory lesions with no more than a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only, no nodular lesions). 3 Moderate Greater than Grade 2, up to many non-inflammatory lesions and may have some inflammatory lesions, but no more than one small nodular lesion. 4 Severe Greater than Grade 3, up to many non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions, but no more than a few nodular lesions. 5 Very severe Many non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions and more than a few nodular lesions. May have cystic lesions. Absolute and percent reductions in lesion counts and the IGA scale after 12 weeks of treatment in these 2 trials are shown in Table 3. Each trial needed to have a statistically significant reduction in 2 out of 3 lesion counts at Week 12. Table 3.

See \"Who should not use Tazarotene Foam?\" are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if tazarotene passes into your breast milk. You and your doctor should decide if you will use Tazarotene Foam or breastfeed. You should not do both. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you use Tazarotene Foam. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Especially tell your doctor if you: use other medicines or products that make your skin dry take other medicines that may increase your sensitivity to sunlight Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one that is listed above. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of your medicines and show it to your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I use Tazarotene Foam? Use Tazarotene Foam exactly as your doctor tells you to. Do not use more Tazarotene Foam than prescribed and do not use it more often than your doctor tells you to. If you are a female and have menstrual periods, begin using Tazarotene Foam during a normal menstrual period to help assure that you are not pregnant when you begin use. See \"Who should not use Tazarotene Foam?\" Tazarotene Foam is flammable. Avoid fire, flame, and smoking during and right after you apply Tazarotene Foam. Gently clean the affected area (face and/or upper trunk) with a mild cleanser and dry completely before using Tazarotene Foam. Apply Tazarotene Foam one time each day, before going to bed, to the affected areas (face and/or upper trunk) where you have acne lesions. Use enough foam to cover the entire affected area with a thin film of Tazarotene Foam. Keep Tazarotene Foam away from your eyes, mouth, and vagina. If Tazarotene Foam comes into contact with your eyes, rinse them well with water. Wash your hands after applying Tazarotene Foam. If you use too much Tazarotene Foam, you may get redness, peeling, or skin irritation in the treated area. Call your doctor if this happens, or if you accidentally swallow Tazarotene Foam. Follow your doctor's directions for other routine skin care and the use of make-up. You may also use a moisturizer as needed. Instructions for applying Tazarotene Foam 1. Shake the Tazarotene Foam can before use. 2. Remove cap from can. See Figure A . Figure A 3. Hold the Tazarotene Foam can upright at a slight angle and press the nozzle. See Figure B . Figure B 4.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: May cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Obtain a pregnancy test in females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception. ( 5.1 ) Local Irritation: Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness, or peeling. If these adverse reactions occur, discontinue tazarotene cream until the integrity of the skin has been restored or reduce dosing interval. Avoid using tazarotene cream on eczematous skin, as such use may cause severe irritation. ( 5.2 ) Photosensitivity and Risk of Sunburn: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. Avoid using tazarotene cream if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers. ( 5.3 ) Lentigo Maligna: Carefully assess facial pigmented lesions of concern before application of tazarotene cream. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy . Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from tazarotene cream use during pregnancy; therefore, discontinue tazarotene cream as soon as pregnancy is recognized. Tazarotene elicits malformations and developmental effects associated with retinoids after topical and oral administration to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis. However, limited case reports of pregnancy in females enrolled in clinical trials for tazarotene cream have not reported a clear association with tazarotene and major birth defects or miscarriage risk [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in these orally treated animals. Although there may be less systemic exposure in the treatment of the face alone due to less surface area for application, tazarotene is a teratogenic substance in animals, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Advise pregnant females of the potential risk to a fetus. Obtain a pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to tazarotene cream therapy. Initiate tazarotene cream therapy during a menstrual period. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tazarotene cream [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . 5.2 Local Irritation and Hypersensitivity Reactions Local tolerability reactions (including blistering and skin desquamation) and hypersensitivity adverse reactions (including urticaria) have been observed with topical tazarotene. Application of tazarotene cream may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive individuals. Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness, or peeling. If these adverse reactions occur, discontinue the medication until the integrity of the skin is restored, or reduce the dosing to an interval the patient can tolerate. Closely monitor the frequency of application by carefully observing the therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Avoid concomitant use of topical medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect. It is also advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tazarotene cream is begun. Avoid using tazarotene cream on eczematous skin because such use may cause severe irritation. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using tazarotene cream. 5.3 Photosensitivity and Risk of Sunburn Because of heightened burning susceptibility, minimize exposure to ultraviolet rays (including sunlight and sun lamps) during the use of tazarotene cream. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using tazarotene cream. Advise patients with sunburn not to use tazarotene cream until the sunburn is fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure because of their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using tazarotene cream. Avoid using tazarotene cream if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity. 5.4 Lentigo Maligna Some facial pigmented lesions are not lentigines, but rather lentigo maligna, a type of melanoma. Before application of tazarotene cream, carefully assess facial pigmented lesions of concern by a qualified physician (e.g., dermatologist) to exclude a diagnosis of lentigo maligna."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Embryofetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Photosensitivity and Risk of Sunburn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse events (occurring in \u226510% of patients) are desquamation, erythema, burning sensation, dry skin, skin irritation, and pruritus. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. at 1-866-923-4914 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most frequent adverse reactions reported with tazarotene cream, 0.1% that occurred in greater than 10% of subjects, included desquamation, erythema, burning sensation, and dry skin (in descending order). Reactions that occurred in 1 to 10% of subjects, included skin irritation, pruritus, irritant contact dermatitis, stinging, rash, and cheilitis (in descending order). Common adverse events that occurred at a rate of at least 1% and at a higher rate in the tazarotene cream group than in the vehicle group in the clinical trials are presented in the following table.

When combining data from the two trials, 5.3% of subjects in the tazarotene cream group and 0.9% of subjects in the vehicle group discontinued because of adverse events. Overall, 20/567 (3.5%) subjects in the tazarotene cream group and 16/564 (2.8%) subjects in the vehicle group reported adverse events (including edema, irritation, and inflammation) directly related to the eye or eyelid. The majority of these conditions were mild. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tazarotene. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: blister, dermatitis, urticaria, skin exfoliation, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), swelling at or near application sites, and pain."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from tazarotene cream during pregnancy; therefore, tazarotene cream should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Limited case reports of pregnancy in females enrolled in clinical trials for tazarotene cream have not established a clear association with tazarotene and major birth defects or miscarriage risk. Because the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestational age are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown . In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed topically during organogenesis at 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits dosed topically with tazarotene gel at 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, there was a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, tazarotene dosed orally during organogenesis at 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays . In pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed orally prior to mating through early gestation resulted in decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations at doses approximately 7 times higher than the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% [see Data ]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In rats, a tazarotene 0.05% gel formulation dosed topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day, which represented 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% ( i.e. , 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area), resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel, which represented 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, during gestation days 6 through 18, had a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats, and malformations and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses representing 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%. In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, classic developmental effects of retinoids were observed including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at that dose. In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of tazarotene gel (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival, but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the maximum systemic exposure in the rat would be equivalent to the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of tazarotene in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. After single topical doses of 14C-tazarotene gel to the skin of lactating rats, radioactivity was detected in rat milk. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of tazarotene cream to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tazarotene cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tazarotene cream or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating tazarotene cream therapy which should begin during a menstrual period. Contraception Females Based on animal studies, tazarotene cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tazarotene cream. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tazarotene cream have not been established in patients under the age of 17 years with facial fine wrinkling, facial mottled hyper- and hypopigmentation, and benign facial lentigines. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the studies of facial fine wrinkling, facial mottled hyper- and hypopigmentation, and benign facial lentigines, 44 male subjects and 180 female subjects out of the total population of 1131 subjects were older than 65 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3, but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2 and RAR\u03b3, and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings for the mitigation of facial fine wrinkling, facial mottled hyper- and hypopigmentation, and benign facial lentigines is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Little parent compound could be detected in the plasma. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones, and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. The half-life of tazarotenic acid was approximately 18 hours. Tazarotene cream 0.1% was topically applied once daily over four weeks to either the face (6 females and 2 males) or to 15% of body surface area (8 females and 8 males) in subjects with fine wrinkling and mottled hyperpigmentation. In the \"face-only\" dosing group, the maximum average C max and AUC 0-24hr values of tazarotenic acid occurred on Day 15 with mean \u00b1 SD values of C max and AUC 0-24hr of tazarotenic acid being 0.236 \u00b1 0.255 ng/mL (N=8) and 2.44 \u00b1 1.38 ng\u2219hr/mL (N=8), respectively. The mean C max and AUC 0-24hr values of tazarotenic acid from subjects in the 15% body surface area dosing group were approximately 10 times higher than those from subjects in the face-only dosing group. The single highest C max throughout the trial period was 3.43 ng/mL on day 29 from subjects in the 15% body surface area dosing group. Gender had no influence on the systemic bioavailability of tazarotenic acid. Blood samples were collected from one of the two phase 3 trials to evaluate the systemic exposure following application of tazarotene cream 0.1% once daily for 24 weeks (double-blind period) followed by 28 weeks (open-label) under clinical conditions. The mean plasma tazarotenic acid concentrations, following topical treatment with tazarotene cream 0.1% over 52 weeks, ranged between 0.092 \u00b1 0.073 ng/mL and 0.127 \u00b1 0.142 ng/mL. The single highest observed tazarotenic acid concentration throughout the 52-week trial was 0.705 ng/mL (observed at week 36). Systemic availability of tazarotenic acid was minimal and remained steady following once daily application of tazarotene cream 0.1% to the faces of subjects in the trial for up to 52 weeks."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A long term study of tazarotene following oral administration of 0.025 mg/kg/day, 0.050 mg/kg/day, and 0.125 mg/kg/day to rats showed no indications of increased carcinogenic risks. Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in the rat equivalent to the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream 0.1%. A long-term topical application study of up to 0.1% tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice, terminated at 88 weeks, showed that dose levels of 0.05 mg/kg/day, 0.125 mg/kg/day, 0.25 mg/kg/day, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared to vehicle control animals. Systemic exposure at the highest dose represented 8 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream 0.1%. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in a human lymphocyte assay. Tazarotene was also non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. No impairment of fertility occurred in rats when male animals were treated for 70 days prior to mating and female animals were treated for 14 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation with topical doses of tazarotene gel up to 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat would be equivalent to the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream 0.1%. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in male rats treated for 70 days prior to mating with oral doses of up to 1 mg/kg/day tazarotene, which represented 4 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream 0.1%. No effect on parameters of mating performance or fertility was observed in female rats treated for 15 days prior to mating and continuing through day 7 of gestation with oral doses of tazarotene up to 2 mg/kg/day. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of estrous stages and an increase in developmental effects at that dose, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream 0.1% [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two double-blind, randomized vehicle-controlled trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2) enrolled 1131 subjects with mild to severe fine wrinkling, facial mottled hyper- and hypo-pigmentation, and benign facial lentigines because of sun overexposure. Both trials compared the application of tazarotene cream 0.1% to its vehicle once daily for 24 weeks to the facial skin. Treatment was as an adjunct to a comprehensive skin care and sun avoidance program that included use of sunscreens, protective clothing, and non-prescription emollient cream. In both trials, the endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving an improvement of at least one grade from baseline in fine wrinkling, mottled hypo- and hyper-pigmentation, and benign facial lentigines. At two to four week intervals, the severity of fine wrinkling, mottled hyper-and hypo-pigmentation, and benign facial lentigines were graded on a using a 5-point photonumeric scale (0 = none, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe). Of 1131 subjects, approximately 97% of subjects in clinical trials were white (Caucasian) with 80% of subjects in the clinical studies having Fitzpatrick skin type classifications I-III. The distribution of subject skin types were: Type I \u201312%; Type II \u2013 26%; Type III \u2013 40%; and Type IV 22%. Subjects with skin types V and VI were not studied. Insufficient number of non-white subjects (Asian, Hispanic, or other) were studied to make an adequate determination of efficacy of tazarotene cream in such subjects.

( 2.2 ) If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Tazarotene cream is for topical use only. Tazarotene cream is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. If contact with mucous membranes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Wash hands thoroughly after application. 2.2 Psoriasis It is recommended that treatment starts with tazarotene cream, 0.05%, with strength increased to 0.1% if tolerated and medically indicated. Apply a thin film (2 mg/cm 2 ) of tazarotene cream once per day, in the evening, to cover only the psoriatic lesions. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the cream. If emollients are used, they should be applied at least an hour before application of tazarotene cream. Because unaffected skin may be more susceptible to irritation, application of tazarotene cream to these areas should be carefully avoided. 2.3 Acne Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer (2 mg/cm 2 ) of tazarotene cream 0.1% once per day, in the evening, to the skin areas where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affected area. Use effective sunscreens and wear protective clothing while using tazarotene cream [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryofetal Toxicity: Tazarotene cream contains tazarotene, which is a teratogenic substance. Tazarotene cream is contraindicated in pregnancy. Females of child-bearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment and use an effective method of contraception during treatment. ( 5.1 ) Local Irritation: Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling. If these effects occur, discontinue until the integrity of the skin has been restored, or reduce dosing interval, or in the case of psoriasis, may switch to the lower concentration. Tazarotene cream should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. ( 5.2 ) Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. Tazarotene cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in orally treated animals. Although there may be less systemic exposure in the treatment of acne of the face alone due to less surface area for application, tazarotene is a teratogenic substance, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . There were thirteen reported pregnancies in subjects who participated in the clinical trials for topical tazarotene. Nine of the subjects were found to have been treated with topical tazarotene, and the other four had been treated with vehicle. One of the subjects who was treated with tazarotene cream elected to terminate the pregnancy for non-medical reasons unrelated to treatment. The other eight pregnant women who were inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during clinical trials subsequently delivered apparently healthy babies. As the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation times are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. Females of Child-bearing Potential Females of child-bearing potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when tazarotene cream is used. The possibility that a female of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. A negative result for pregnancy test should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to tazarotene cream therapy. Tazarotene cream therapy should begin during a menstrual period [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Local Irritation and Hypersensitivity Reactions Local tolerability reactions (including blistering and skin desquamation) and hypersensitivity adverse reactions (including urticaria) have been observed with topical tazarotene. Application of tazarotene cream may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive individuals. Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling. If these effects occur, the medication should either be discontinued until the integrity of the skin is restored, or the dosing should be reduced to an interval the patient can tolerate. However, efficacy at reduced frequency of application has not been established. Alternatively, patients with psoriasis who are being treated with the 0.1% concentration can be switched to the lower concentration. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Therapy can be resumed, or the drug concentration or frequency of application can be increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate treatment. Concomitant topical medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tazarotene cream is begun. Tazarotene cream should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using tazarotene cream. 5.3 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of tazarotene cream. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using tazarotene cream. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use tazarotene cream until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using tazarotene cream. Tazarotene cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Embryofetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Photosensitivity and Risk of Sunburn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Plaque psoriasis: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 23% of patients are pruritus, erythema, and burning. ( 6.1 ) Acne Vulgaris: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 30% of patients are desquamation, dry skin, erythema, and burning sensation. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., at 1-866-923-4914 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In human dermal safety trials, tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% did not induce allergic contact sensitization, phototoxicity, or photoallergy. Psoriasis The most frequent adverse reactions reported with tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% occurring in 10 to 23% of subjects, in descending order, included pruritus, erythema, and burning. Reactions occurring in greater than 1 to less than 10% of subjects, in descending order, included irritation, desquamation, stinging, contact dermatitis, dermatitis, eczema, worsening of psoriasis, skin pain, rash, hypertriglyceridemia, dry skin, skin inflammation, and peripheral edema. Tazarotene cream, 0.1% was associated with a greater degree of local irritation than the 0.05% cream. The rates of irritation adverse reactions reported during psoriasis trials with tazarotene cream, 0.1% were 0.1 to 0.4% higher than those reported for tazarotene cream, 0.05%. Acne The most frequent adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with tazarotene cream 0.1% in the treatment of acne, occurring in 10 to 30% of subjects, in descending order included desquamation, dry skin, erythema, and burning sensation. Reactions occurring in 1 to 5% of subjects included pruritus, irritation, face pain, and stinging. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tazarotene. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: blister, dermatitis, urticaria, skin exfoliation, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), swelling at or near application sites, and pain."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tazarotene cream. In a trial of 27 healthy female subjects between the ages of 20 to 55 years receiving a combination oral contraceptive tablet containing 1 mg norethindrone and 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol, concomitant use of tazarotene administered as 1.1 mg orally (mean \u00b1 SD C max and AUC 0-24 of tazarotenic acid were 28.9 \u00b1 9.4 ng/mL and 120.6 \u00b1 28.5 ng\u2219hr/mL) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol over a complete cycle. The impact of tazarotene on the pharmacokinetics of progestin only oral contraceptives (i.e., minipills) has not been evaluated."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from tazarotene cream during pregnancy; therefore, tazarotene cream should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Limited case reports of pregnancy in females enrolled in clinical trials for tazarotene cream have not established a clear association with tazarotene and major birth defects or miscarriage risk. Because the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestational age are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed topically during organogenesis at 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits dosed topically with tazarotene gel at 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, there was a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, tazarotene dosed orally during organogenesis at 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays. In pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed orally prior to mating through early gestation resulted in decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations at doses approximately 7 times higher than the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% [see Data ] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In rats, a tazarotene gel, 0.05% formulation dosed topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day, which represented 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% (i.e., 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area), resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel, which represented 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, during gestation days 6 through 18, had a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats, and malformations and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses representing 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%. In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, classic developmental effects of retinoids were observed including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at that dose. In a pre-and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of tazarotene gel (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival, but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the maximum systemic exposure in the rat would be equivalent to the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of tazarotene in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. After single topical doses of 14 C-tazarotene gel to the skin of lactating rats, radioactivity was detected in rat milk. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of tazarotene cream to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tazarotene cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tazarotene cream or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating tazarotene cream therapy which should begin during a menstrual period. Contraception Females Based on animal studies, tazarotene cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tazarotene cream. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tazarotene cream have not been established in patients with psoriasis under the age of 18 years, or in patients with acne under the age of 12 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tazarotene cream for the treatment of acne has not been clinically tested in persons 65 years of age or older. Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials of tazarotene cream for plaque psoriasis, 120 were over the age of 65. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Currently there is no other clinical experience on the differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

Data Animal Data In rats, a tazarotene gel, 0.05% formulation dosed topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day, which represented 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% (i.e., 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area), resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel, which represented 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, during gestation days 6 through 18, had a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats, and malformations and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses representing 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%. In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, classic developmental effects of retinoids were observed including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at that dose. In a pre-and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of tazarotene gel (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival, but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the maximum systemic exposure in the rat would be equivalent to the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3, but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3 and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Little parent compound could be detected in the plasma. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. The half-life of tazarotenic acid was approximately 18 hours, following topical application of tazarotene to normal, acne or psoriatic skin. In a multiple dose trial with a once daily dose for 14 consecutive days in 9 psoriatic subjects (male=5; female=4), measured doses of tazarotene cream, 0.1% were applied by medical staff to involved skin without occlusion (5 to 35% of total body surface area: mean \u00b1 SD: 14 \u00b1 11%). The C max of tazarotenic acid was 2.31 \u00b1 2.78 ng/mL occurring 8 hours after the final dose, and the AUC 0-24h was 31.2 \u00b1 35.2 ng\u2219hr/mL on day 15 in the five subjects who were administered clinical doses of 2 mg cream/cm 2 . During clinical trials with tazarotene cream, 0.05% or 0.1% treatment for plaque psoriasis, three out of 139 subjects with their systemic exposure monitored had detectable plasma tazarotene concentrations, with the highest value at 0.09 ng/mL. Tazarotenic acid was detected in 78 out of 139 subjects (LLOQ = 0.05 ng/mL). Three subjects using tazarotene cream 0.1% had plasma tazarotenic acid concentrations greater than 1 ng/mL. The highest value was 2.4 ng/mL. However, because of the variations in the time of blood sampling, the area of psoriasis involvement, and the dose of tazarotene applied, actual maximal plasma levels are unknown. Tazarotene cream 0.1% was applied once daily to either the face (N=8) or to 15% of body surface area (N=10) of female subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris. The mean C max and AUC values of tazarotenic acid peaked at day 15 for both dosing groups during a 29 day treatment period. Mean C max and AUC 0-24h values of tazarotenic acid from subjects in the 15% body surface area dosing group were more than 10 times higher than those from subjects in the face-only dosing group. The single highest C max throughout the trial period was 1.91 ng/mL on day 15 in the exaggerated dosing group. In the face-only group, the mean \u00b1 SD values of C max and AUC 0-24h of tazarotenic acid on day 15 were 0.10 \u00b1 0.06 ng/mL and 1.54 \u00b1 1.01 ng\u2219hr/mL, respectively, whereas in the 15% body surface area dosing group, the mean \u00b1 SD values of C max and AUC 0-24h of tazarotenic acid on day 15 were 1.20 \u00b1 0.41 ng/mL and 17.01 \u00b1 6.15 ng\u2219hr/mL, respectively. The steady state pharmacokinetics of tazarotenic acid had been reached by day 8 in the face-only and by day 15 in the 15% body surface area dosing groups. In a Phase 3 clinical trial, tazarotene cream, 0.1% was applied once daily for 12 weeks to each of 48 subjects (22 females and 26 males) with facial acne vulgaris. The mean \u00b1 SD values of plasma tazarotenic acid at weeks 4 and 8 were 0.078 \u00b1 0.073 ng/mL (N=47) and 0.052 \u00b1 0.037 ng/mL (N=42), respectively. The highest observed individual plasma tazarotenic acid concentration was 0.41 ng/mL at week 4 from a female subject. The magnitude of plasma tazarotenic acid concentrations appears to be independent of gender, age, and body weight."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis A long-term study of tazarotene following oral administration of 0.025 mg/kg/day, 0.050 mg/kg/day, and 0.125 mg/kg/day to rats showed no indications of increased carcinogenic risks. Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in the rat equivalent to 0.6 times that seen in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/kg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study. This estimated systemic exposure in rats was 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area. A long-term topical application study of up to 0.1% of tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice terminated at 88 weeks showed that dose levels of 0.05 mg/kg/day, 0.125 mg/kg/day, 0.25 mg/kg/day, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared to vehicle control animals. Systemic exposures at the highest dose was 3.9 times that seen in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study, and 13 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area. In evaluation of photo co-carcinogenicity, median time to onset of tumors was decreased, and the number of tumors increased in hairless mice following chronic topical dosing with intercurrent exposure to ultraviolet radiation at tazarotene concentrations of 0.001%, 0.005%, and 0.01% in a gel formulation for up to 40 weeks. Mutagenesis Tazarotene was found to be non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in a human lymphocyte assay. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility No impairment of fertility occurred in rats when male animals were treated for 70 days prior to mating and female animals were treated for 14 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation with topical doses of tazarotene gel up to 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat would be equivalent to 0.6 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study, and 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in male rats treated for 70 days prior to mating with oral doses of up to 1 mg/kg/day tazarotene. That dose produced a systemic exposure that was 1.9 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area, and 6.3 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in female rats treated for 15 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation day 7 with oral doses up to 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of estrous stages and an increase in developmental effects at that dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . That dose produced a systemic exposure that was 3.4 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area and 11 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area. Reproductive capabilities of F1 animals, including F2 survival and development, were not affected by topical administration of tazarotene gel to female F0 parental rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 at the maximum tolerated dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat would be equivalent to 0.6 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area, and 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Embryofetal Toxicity: tazarotene cream contains tazarotene, which is a teratogenic substance. Tazarotene cream is contraindicated in pregnancy. Females of child-bearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment and use an effective method of contraception during treatment. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Local Irritation: Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling. If these effects occur, discontinue until the integrity of the skin has been restored, or reduce dosing interval, or in the case of psoriasis, may switch to the lower concentration. Tazarotene cream should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. Tazarotene cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in orally treated animals. Tazarotene is a teratogenic substance, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . There were thirteen reported pregnancies in subjects who participated in the clinical trials for topical tazarotene. Nine of the subjects were found to have been treated with topical tazarotene, and the other four had been treated with vehicle. One of the subjects who was treated with tazarotene cream elected to terminate the pregnancy for non-medical reasons unrelated to treatment. The other eight pregnant women who were inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during clinical trials subsequently delivered apparently healthy babies. As the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation times are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. Females of Child-bearing Potential Females of child-bearing potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when tazarotene cream is used. The possibility that a female of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. A negative result for pregnancy test should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to tazarotene cream therapy. Tazarotene cream therapy should begin during a menstrual period [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.2 Local Irritation and Hypersensitivity Reactions Local tolerability reactions (including blistering and skin desquamation) and hypersensitivity adverse reactions (including urticaria) have been observed with topical tazarotene. Application of tazarotene cream may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive individuals. Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling. If these effects occur, the medication should either be discontinued until the integrity of the skin is restored, or the dosing should be reduced to an interval the patient can tolerate. However, efficacy at reduced frequency of application has not been established. Alternatively, patients with psoriasis who are being treated with the 0.1% concentration can be switched to the lower concentration. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Therapy can be resumed, or the drug concentration or frequency of application can be increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate treatment. Concomitant topical medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tazarotene cream is begun. Tazarotene cream, should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using tazarotene cream. 5.3 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of tazarotene cream. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using tazarotene cream. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use tazarotene cream until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using tazarotene cream. Tazarotene cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity."

In human dermal safety trials, tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% did not induce allergic contact sensitization, phototoxicity, or photoallergy. Psoriasis The most frequent adverse reactions reported with tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% occurring in 10 to 23% of subjects, in descending order, included pruritus, erythema, and burning. Reactions occurring in greater than 1 to less than 10% of subjects, in descending order, included irritation, desquamation, stinging, contact dermatitis, dermatitis, eczema, worsening of psoriasis, skin pain, rash, hypertriglyceridemia, dry skin, skin inflammation, and peripheral edema. Tazarotene cream, 0.1% was associated with a greater degree of local irritation than the 0.05% cream. The rates of irritation adverse reactions reported during psoriasis trials with tazarotene cream, 0.1% were 0.1-0.4% higher than those reported for tazarotene cream, 0.05%. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tazarotene. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: blister, dermatitis, urticaria, skin exfoliation, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), swelling at or near application sites, and pain."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from tazarotene cream during pregnancy; therefore, tazarotene cream should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Limited case reports of pregnancy in females enrolled in clinical trials for tazarotene cream have not established a clear association with tazarotene and major birth defects or miscarriage risk. Because the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestational age are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed topically during organogenesis at 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits dosed topically with tazarotene gel at 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, there was a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, tazarotene dosed orally during organogenesis at 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays. In pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed orally prior to mating through early gestation resulted in decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations at doses approximately 7 times higher than the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% [see Data] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In rats, a tazarotene gel, 0.05% formulation dosed topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day, which represented 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% (i.e., 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area), resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel, which represented 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, during gestation days 6 through 18, had a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats, and malformations and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses representing 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%. In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, classic developmental effects of retinoids were observed including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at that dose. In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of tazarotene gel (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival, but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the maximum systemic exposure in the rat would be equivalent to the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of tazarotene in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. After single topical doses of 14 C-tazarotene gel to the skin of lactating rats, radioactivity was detected in rat milk. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of tazarotene cream to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tazarotene cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tazarotene cream or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating tazarotene cream therapy which should begin during a menstrual period. Contraception Females Based on animal studies, tazarotene cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tazarotene cream. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tazarotene cream have not been established in patients with psoriasis under the age of 18 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials of tazarotene cream for plaque psoriasis, 120 were over the age of 65. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Currently there is no other clinical experience on the differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3, but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3 and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Little parent compound could be detected in the plasma. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. The half-life of tazarotenic acid was approximately 18 hours, following topical application of tazarotene to normal or psoriatic skin. In a multiple dose trial with a once daily dose for 14 consecutive days in 9 psoriatic subjects (male=5; female=4), measured doses of tazarotene cream, 0.1% were applied by medical staff to involved skin without occlusion (5 to 35% of total body surface area: mean \u00b1 SD: 14 \u00b1 11%). The C max of tazarotenic acid was 2.31 \u00b1 2.78 ng/mL occurring 8 hours after the final dose, and the AUC 0-24h was 31.2 \u00b1 35.2 ng\u2022hr/mL on day 15 in the five subjects who were administered clinical doses of 2 mg cream/cm 2 . During clinical trials with tazarotene cream, 0.05% or 0.1% treatment for plaque psoriasis, three out of 139 subjects with their systemic exposure monitored had detectable plasma tazarotene concentrations, with the highest value at 0.09 ng/mL. Tazarotenic acid was detected in 78 out of 139 subjects (LLOQ = 0.05 ng/mL). Three subjects using tazarotene cream 0.1% had plasma tazarotenic acid concentrations greater than 1 ng/mL. The highest value was 2.4 ng/mL. However, because of the variations in the time of blood sampling, the area of psoriasis involvement, and the dose of tazarotene applied, actual maximal plasma levels are unknown."

Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in the rat equivalent to 0.6 times that seen in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/kg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study. A long-term topical application study of up to 0.1% of tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice terminated at 88 weeks showed that dose levels of 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared to vehicle control animals. Systemic exposures at the highest dose was 3.9 times that seen in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study. In evaluation of photo co-carcinogenicity, median time to onset of tumors was decreased, and the number of tumors increased in hairless mice following chronic topical dosing with intercurrent exposure to ultraviolet radiation at tazarotene concentrations of 0.001%, 0.005%, and 0.01% in a gel formulation for up to 40 weeks. Mutagenesis Tazarotene was found to be non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in a human lymphocyte assay. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility No impairment of fertility occurred in rats when male animals were treated for 70 days prior to mating and female animals were treated for 14 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation with topical doses of tazarotene gel up to 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat would be equivalent to 0.6 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in male rats treated for 70 days prior to mating with oral doses of up to 1 mg/kg/day tazarotene. That dose produced a systemic exposure that was 1.9 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in female rats treated for 15 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation day 7 with oral doses up to 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of estrous stages and an increase in developmental effects at that dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . That dose produced a systemic exposure that was 3.4 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area. Reproductive capabilities of F1 animals, including F2 survival and development, were not affected by topical administration of tazarotene gel to female F0 parental rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 at the maximum tolerated dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat would be equivalent to 0.6 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis A long-term study of tazarotene following oral administration of 0.025, 0.050, and 0.125 mg/kg/day to rats showed no indications of increased carcinogenic risks. Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in the rat equivalent to 0.6 times that seen in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/kg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study. A long-term topical application study of up to 0.1% of tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice terminated at 88 weeks showed that dose levels of 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared to vehicle control animals. Systemic exposures at the highest dose was 3.9 times that seen in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study. In evaluation of photo co-carcinogenicity, median time to onset of tumors was decreased, and the number of tumors increased in hairless mice following chronic topical dosing with intercurrent exposure to ultraviolet radiation at tazarotene concentrations of 0.001%, 0.005%, and 0.01% in a gel formulation for up to 40 weeks. Mutagenesis Tazarotene was found to be non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in a human lymphocyte assay. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test.

At the end of 12 weeks of treatment, tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% was consistently superior to vehicle in reducing the plaque thickness of psoriasis. Improvements in erythema and scaling were generally significantly greater with tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% than with vehicle. Tazarotene cream, 0.1% was also generally more effective than tazarotene cream, 0.05% in reducing the severity of the individual signs of disease.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tazarotene gel is for topical use only. Tazarotene gel is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. Avoid accidental transfer of tazarotene gel into eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes. If contact with mucous membranes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Wash hands thoroughly after application. Apply a thin layer of tazarotene gel only to the affected area once daily in the evening. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. ( 2.2 ) If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Psoriasis It is recommended that treatment starts with tazarotene gel, 0.05%, with strength increased to 0.1% if tolerated and medically indicated. Apply a thin film (2 mg/cm 2 ) of tazarotene gel once per day, in the evening, to cover only the psoriatic lesions on no more than 20% of body surface area. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the gel. If emollients are used, they should be applied at least an hour before application of tazarotene gel. Because unaffected skin may be more susceptible to irritation, application of tazarotene to these areas should be carefully avoided. Tazarotene gel was investigated for up to 12 months during clinical trials for psoriasis. 2.2 Acne Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer (2 mg/cm 2 ) of tazarotene gel, 0.1% once per day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affected area. Tazarotene gel was investigated for up to 12 weeks during clinical trials for acne.

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryofetal Toxicity: Tazarotene gel contains tazarotene, which is a teratogen. Tazarotene gel is contraindicated in pregnancy. Females of child-bearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment and use an effective method of contraception during treatment. ( 5.1 ) Local Irritation: Excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling can occur. If these reactions occur, discontinue until the integrity of the skin has been restored, or consider reducing dosing frequency or in the case of psoriasis, consider switching to the lower concentration. Tazarotene gel should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. ( 5.2 ) Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. Tazarotene gel should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Tazarotene elicits malformations and developmental effects associated with retinoids after topical and oral administration to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis. Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in orally treated animals. Although there may be less systemic exposure in the treatment of acne of the face alone due to less surface area for application, tazarotene is a teratogenic substance and causes fetal malformations in animals, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. There were thirteen reported pregnancies in subjects who participated in the clinical trials for topical tazarotene. Nine of the subjects had been treated with topical tazarotene, and the other four had been treated with vehicle. One of the subjects who was treated with tazarotene cream elected to terminate the pregnancy for non-medical reasons unrelated to treatment. The other eight pregnant women who were inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during the clinical trials subsequently delivered apparently healthy babies. As the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation times are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. Females of Child-bearing Potential Females of child-bearing potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when tazarotene gel is used. The possibility that a female of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. A negative result for pregnancy test should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to tazarotene gel therapy. Tazarotene gel therapy should begin during a normal menstrual period [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.2 Local Irritation and Hypersensitivity Reactions Application of tazarotene gel may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive individuals. Local reactions (including blistering and skin desquamation, pruritus, burning, erythema) and hypersensitivity adverse reactions (including urticaria) have been observed with topical tazarotene. If these adverse reactions occur, consider discontinuing the medication or reducing the dosing frequency, as appropriate, until the integrity of the skin is restored. Alternatively, patients with psoriasis who are being treated with the 0.1% concentration can be switched to the lower concentration. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Therapy can be resumed, or the drug concentration or frequency of application can be increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate treatment. Concomitant topical medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before treatment with tazarotene gel is initiated. Tazarotene gel, should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using tazarotene gel. 5.3 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of tazarotene gel. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using tazarotene gel. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use tazarotene gel until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using tazarotene gel. Tazarotene gel should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Embryofetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Photosensitivity and Risk of Sunburn [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Plaque Psoriasis: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 30% of patients are pruritus, burning/stinging, erythema, worsening of psoriasis, irritation, and skin pain. ( 6.1 ) Acne Vulgaris: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 30% of patients are desquamation, burning/stinging, dry skin, erythema and pruritus. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cosette Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-922-1038 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Psoriasis A total of 439 subjects 14 to 87 years of age were treated with tazarotene gel, 0.05% and 0.1% in two controlled clinical trials. The most frequent adverse events reported with tazarotene gel, 0.05% and 0.1% occurring in 10 to 30% of subjects, in descending order, included pruritus, burning/stinging, erythema, worsening of psoriasis, irritation, and skin pain. Reactions occurring in 1 to 10% of subjects included rash, desquamation, irritant contact dermatitis, skin inflammation, fissuring, bleeding, and dry skin. Increases in \u201cpsoriasis worsening\u201d and \u201csun-induced erythema\u201d were noted in some subjects over the 4th to 12th months of treatment as compared to the first three months of a 1 year study. In general, the incidence of adverse events with tazarotene gel 0.05% was 2 to 5% lower than that seen with tazarotene gel 0.1%. Acne A total of 596 subjects 12 to 44 years of age were treated with tazarotene gel, 0.05% and 0.1% in two controlled clinical trials. The most frequent adverse events reported during clinical trials with tazarotene gel, 0.1% in the treatment of acne occurring in 10 to 30% of subjects, in descending order, included desquamation, burning/stinging, dry skin, erythema and pruritus. Reactions occurring in 1 to 10% of subjects included irritation, skin pain, fissuring, localized edema and skin discoloration. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tazarotene. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: blister, dermatitis, urticaria, skin exfoliation, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), swelling at or near application sites, and pain."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from tazarotene gel during pregnancy; therefore, tazarotene gel should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Limited case reports of pregnancy in females enrolled in clinical trials for tazarotene gel have not established a clear association with tazarotene and major birth defects or miscarriage risk. Because the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestational age are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed topically during organogenesis at 0.5 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of tazarotene gel, 0.1% resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits dosed topically with tazarotene gel at 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, there were single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, tazarotene dosed orally during organogenesis at 0.5 and 13 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% resulted in malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays. In pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed orally prior to mating through early gestation resulted in decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations at doses approximately 2 times higher than the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% [see Data] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In rats, a tazarotene gel, 0.05% formulation dosed topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day, which represented 0.5 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% (i.e., 2 mg/cm 2 over a 20% body surface area), resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, during gestation days 6 through 18 were noted with single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats, and malformations and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing 0.5 and 13 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, which represented 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, classic developmental effects of retinoids were observed including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at that dose. In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of tazarotene gel (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival, but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the maximum systemic exposure in the rat would be 0.3 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of tazarotene in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. After single topical doses of 14 C-tazarotene gel to the skin of lactating rats, radioactivity was detected in rat milk. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of tazarotene gel to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tazarotene gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tazarotene gel or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating tazarotene gel therapy which should begin during a menstrual period. Contraception Females Based on animal studies, tazarotene gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tazarotene gel. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tazarotene gel have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriasis or acne under the age of 12 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials of tazarotene gel for plaque psoriasis, 163 were over the age of 65. Subjects over 65 years of age experienced more adverse events and lower treatment success rates after 12 weeks of use of tazarotene gel compared with those 65 years of age and younger. Currently there is no other clinical experience on the differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Tazarotene gel for the treatment of acne has not been clinically evaluated in persons over the age of 65."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3, but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3 and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and facial acne vulgaris is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of tazarotene gel in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and facial acne vulgaris are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Little parent compound could be detected in the plasma. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. The half-life of tazarotenic acid was approximately 18 hours, following topical application of tazarotene to normal, acne or psoriatic skin. The human in vivo studies described below were conducted with tazarotene gel applied topically at approximately 2 mg/cm 2 and left on the skin for 10 to 12 hours. Both the peak plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) refer to the active metabolite only. Two single, topical dose studies were conducted using 14 C-tazarotene gel. Systemic absorption, as determined from radioactivity in the excreta, was less than 1% of the applied dose (without occlusion) in six subjects with psoriasis and approximately 5% of the applied dose (under occlusion) in six healthy subjects. One non-radiolabeled single-dose study comparing the 0.05% gel to the 0.1% gel in healthy subjects indicated that the C max and AUC were 40% higher for the 0.1% gel. After 7 days of topical dosing with measured doses of tazarotene 0.1% gel on 20% of the total body surface without occlusion in 24 healthy subjects, the C max for tazarotenic acid was 0.72 \u00b1 0.58 ng/mL (mean \u00b1 SD) occurring 9 hours after the last dose, and the AUC 0-24hr for tazarotenic acid was 10.1 \u00b1 7.2 ng\u00b7hr/mL. Systemic absorption was 0.91 \u00b1 0.67% of the applied dose. In a 14-day study in five subjects with psoriasis, measured doses of tazarotene 0.1% gel were applied daily by nursing staff to involved skin without occlusion (8 to 18% of total body surface area; mean \u00b1 SD: 13 \u00b1 5%). The C max for tazarotenic acid was 12.0 \u00b1 7.6 ng/mL occurring 6 hours after the final dose, and the AUC 0-24hr for tazarotenic acid was 105 \u00b1 55 ng\u00b7hr/mL. Systemic absorption was 14.8 \u00b1 7.6% of the applied dose. Extrapolation of these results to represent dosing on 20% of total body surface yielded estimates for tazarotenic acid with C max of 18.9 \u00b1 10.6 ng/mL and AUC 0-24hr of 172 \u00b1 88 ng\u00b7hr/mL. An in vitro percutaneous absorption study, using radiolabeled drug and freshly excised human skin or human cadaver skin, indicated that approximately 4 to 5% of the applied dose was in the stratum corneum (tazarotene: tazarotenic acid = 5:1) and 2 to 4% was in the viable epidermis-dermis layer (tazarotene: tazarotenic acid = 2:1) 24 hours after topical application of the gel."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A long-term study of tazarotene following oral administration of 0.025, 0.050, and 0.125 mg/kg/day to rats showed no indications of increased carcinogenic risks. Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter-term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in the rat 0.3 times that seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. A long-term study with topical administration of up to 0.1% tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice terminated at 88 weeks showed that dose levels of 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared to vehicle control animals. Systemic exposure at the highest dose was 2 times that seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in a human lymphocyte assay. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. No impairment of fertility occurred in rats when male animals were treated for 70 days prior to mating and female animals were treated for 14 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation with topical doses of tazarotene gel up to 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat at the highest dose was 0.3 times that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in male rats treated for 70 days prior to mating with oral doses of up to 1 mg/kg/day tazarotene, which produced systemic exposure that was approximately equivalent to that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in female rats treated for 15 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation day 7 with oral doses of tazarotene up to 2 mg/kg/day. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of estrous stages and an increase in developmental effects at that dose, which produced systemic exposure 2 times that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tazarotene gel is for topical use only. Tazarotene gel is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. Avoid accidental transfer of tazarotene gel into eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes. If contact with mucous membranes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Wash hands thoroughly after application. \u2022 Apply a thin layer of tazarotene gel only to the affected area once daily in the evening. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) \u2022 Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Psoriasis It is recommended that treatment starts with tazarotene gel, 0.05%, with strength increased to 0.1% if tolerated and medically indicated. Apply a thin film (2 mg/cm 2 ) of tazarotene gel once per day, in the evening, to cover only the psoriatic lesions on no more than 20% of body surface area. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the gel. If emollients are used, they should be applied at least an hour before application of tazarotene gel. Because unaffected skin may be more susceptible to irritation, application of tazarotene to these areas should be carefully avoided. Tazarotene gel was investigated for up to 12 months during clinical trials for psoriasis. 2.2 Acne Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer (2 mg/cm 2 ) of tazarotene gel 0.1% once per day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affected area. Tazarotene gel was investigated for up to 12 weeks during clinical trials for acne. Use effective sunscreens and wear protective clothing while using tazarotene gel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] ."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Embryofetal Toxicity: Tazarotene gel contains tazarotene, which is a teratogen. Tazarotene gel is contraindicated in pregnancy. Females of child-bearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment and use an effective method of contraception during treatment. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Local Irritation: Excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling can occur. If these reactions occur, discontinue until the integrity of the skin has been restored, or consider reducing dosing frequency or in the case of psoriasis, consider switching to the lower concentration. Tazarotene gel should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. Tazarotene gel should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Tazarotene elicits malformations and developmental effects associated with retinoids after topical and oral administration to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis. Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in orally treated animals. Although there may be less systemic exposure in the treatment of acne of the face alone due to less surface area for application, tazarotene is a teratogenic substance and causes fetal malformations in animals, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . There were thirteen reported pregnancies in subjects who participated in the clinical trials for topical tazarotene. Nine of the subjects had been treated with topical tazarotene, and the other four had been treated with vehicle. One of the subjects who was treated with tazarotene cream elected to terminate the pregnancy for non-medical reasons unrelated to treatment. The other eight pregnant women who were inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during the clinical trials subsequently delivered apparently healthy babies. As the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation times are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. Females of Child-bearing Potential Females of child-bearing potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when tazarotene gel is used. The possibility that a female of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. A negative result for pregnancy test should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to tazarotene gel therapy. Tazarotene gel therapy should begin during a normal menstrual period [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . 5.2 Local Irritation and Hypersensitivity Reactions Application of tazarotene gel may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive individuals. Local reactions (including blistering and skin desquamation, pruritus, burning, erythema) and hypersensitivity adverse reactions (including urticaria) have been observed with topical tazarotene. If these adverse reactions occur, consider discontinuing the medication or reducing the dosing frequency, as appropriate, until the integrity of the skin is restored. Alternatively, patients with psoriasis who are being treated with the 0.1% concentration can be switched to the lower concentration. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Therapy can be resumed, or the drug concentration or frequency of application can be increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate treatment. Concomitant topical medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before treatment with tazarotene gel is initiated. Tazarotene gel, should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using tazarotene gel. 5.3 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of tazarotene gel. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using tazarotene gel. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use tazarotene gel until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using tazarotene gel. Tazarotene gel should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Embryofetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \u2022 Photosensitivity and Risk of Sunburn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \u2022 Plaque Psoriasis: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 30% of patients are pruritus, burning/stinging, erythema, worsening of psoriasis, irritation, and skin pain. ( 6.1 ) \u2022 Acne Vulgaris: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 30% of patients are desquamation, burning/stinging, dry skin, erythema and pruritus. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Padagis \u00ae at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Psoriasis A total of 439 subjects 14 to 87 years of age were treated with tazarotene gel, 0.05% and 0.1% in two controlled clinical trials. The most frequent adverse events reported with tazarotene gel, 0.05% and 0.1% occurring in 10 to 30% of subjects, in descending order, included pruritus, burning/stinging, erythema, worsening of psoriasis, irritation, and skin pain. Reactions occurring in 1 to 10% of subjects included rash, desquamation, irritant contact dermatitis, skin inflammation, fissuring, bleeding, and dry skin. Increases in \u201cpsoriasis worsening\u201d and \u201csun-induced erythema\u201d were noted in some subjects over the 4th to 12th months of treatment as compared to the first three months of a 1 year study. In general, the incidence of adverse events with tazarotene gel 0.05% was 2 to 5% lower than that seen with tazarotene gel 0.1%. Acne A total of 596 subjects 12 to 44 years of age were treated with tazarotene gel, 0.05% and 0.1% in two controlled clinical trials. The most frequent adverse events reported during clinical trials with tazarotene gel, 0.1% in the treatment of acne occurring in 10 to 30% of subjects, in descending order, included desquamation, burning/stinging, dry skin, erythema and pruritus. Reactions occurring in 1 to 10% of subjects included irritation, skin pain, fissuring, localized edema and skin discoloration. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tazarotene. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: blister, dermatitis, urticaria, skin exfoliation, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), swelling at or near application sites, and pain."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from tazarotene gel during pregnancy; therefore, tazarotene gel should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Limited case reports of pregnancy in females enrolled in clinical trials for tazarotene gel have not established a clear association with tazarotene and major birth defects or miscarriage risk. Because the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestational age are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed topically during organogenesis at 0.5 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of tazarotene gel, 0.1% resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits dosed topically with tazarotene gel at 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, there were single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, tazarotene dosed orally during organogenesis at 0.5 and 13 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% resulted in malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays. In pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed orally prior to mating through early gestation resulted in decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations at doses approximately 2 times higher than the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% [see Data] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In rats, a tazarotene gel, 0.05% formulation dosed topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day, which represented 0.5 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% (i.e., 2 mg/cm 2 over a 20% body surface area), resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, during gestation days 6 through 18 were noted with single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats, and malformations and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing 0.5 and 13 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, which represented 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, classic developmental effects of retinoids were observed including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at that dose. In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of tazarotene gel (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival, but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the maximum systemic exposure in the rat would be 0.3 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of tazarotene in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. After single topical doses of 14 C-tazarotene gel to the skin of lactating rats, radioactivity was detected in rat milk. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of tazarotene gel to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tazarotene gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tazarotene gel or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating tazarotene gel therapy which should begin during a menstrual period. Contraception Females Based on animal studies, tazarotene gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tazarotene gel. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tazarotene gel have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriasis or acne under the age of 12 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials of tazarotene gel for plaque psoriasis, 163 were over the age of 65. Subjects over 65 years of age experienced more adverse events and lower treatment success rates after 12 weeks of use of tazarotene gel compared with those 65 years of age and younger. Currently there is no other clinical experience on the differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Tazarotene gel for the treatment of acne has not been clinically evaluated in persons over the age of 65."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3, but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3 and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and facial acne vulgaris is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of tazarotene gel in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and facial acne vulgaris are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Little parent compound could be detected in the plasma. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. The half-life of tazarotenic acid was approximately 18 hours, following topical application of tazarotene to normal, acne or psoriatic skin. The human in vivo studies described below were conducted with tazarotene gel applied topically at approximately 2 mg/cm 2 and left on the skin for 10 to 12 hours. Both the peak plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) refer to the active metabolite only. Two single, topical dose studies were conducted using 14 C-tazarotene gel. Systemic absorption, as determined from radioactivity in the excreta, was less than 1% of the applied dose (without occlusion) in six subjects with psoriasis and approximately 5% of the applied dose (under occlusion) in six healthy subjects. One non-radiolabeled single-dose study comparing the 0.05% gel to the 0.1% gel in healthy subjects indicated that the C max and AUC were 40% higher for the 0.1% gel. After 7 days of topical dosing with measured doses of tazarotene 0.1% gel on 20% of the total body surface without occlusion in 24 healthy subjects, the C max for tazarotenic acid was 0.72 \u00b1 0.58 ng/mL (mean \u00b1 SD) occurring 9 hours after the last dose, and the AUC 0-24hr for tazarotenic acid was 10.1 \u00b1 7.2 ng\u00b7hr/mL. Systemic absorption was 0.91 \u00b1 0.67% of the applied dose. In a 14-day study in five subjects with psoriasis, measured doses of tazarotene 0.1% gel were applied daily by nursing staff to involved skin without occlusion (8 to 18% of total body surface area; mean \u00b1 SD: 13 \u00b1 5%). The C max for tazarotenic acid was 12.0 \u00b1 7.6 ng/mL occurring 6 hours after the final dose, and the AUC 0-24hr for tazarotenic acid was 105 \u00b1 55 ng\u00b7hr/mL. Systemic absorption was 14.8 \u00b1 7.6% of the applied dose. Extrapolation of these results to represent dosing on 20% of total body surface yielded estimates for tazarotenic acid with C max of 18.9 \u00b1 10.6 ng/mL and AUC 0-24hr of 172 \u00b1 88 ng\u00b7hr/mL. An in vitro percutaneous absorption study, using radiolabeled drug and freshly excised human skin or human cadaver skin, indicated that approximately 4 to 5% of the applied dose was in the stratum corneum (tazarotene: tazarotenic acid = 5:1) and 2 to 4% was in the viable epidermis-dermis layer (tazarotene: tazarotenic acid = 2:1) 24 hours after topical application of the gel."

Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter-term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in the rat 0.3 times that seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. A long-term study with topical administration of up to 0.1% tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice terminated at 88 weeks showed that dose levels of 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared to vehicle control animals. Systemic exposure at the highest dose was 2 times that seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in a human lymphocyte assay. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. No impairment of fertility occurred in rats when male animals were treated for 70 days prior to mating and female animals were treated for 14 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation with topical doses of tazarotene gel up to 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat at the highest dose was 0.3 times that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in male rats treated for 70 days prior to mating with oral doses of up to 1 mg/kg/day tazarotene, which produced systemic exposure that was approximately equivalent to that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in female rats treated for 15 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation day 7 with oral doses of tazarotene up to 2 mg/kg/day. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of estrous stages and an increase in developmental effects at that dose, which produced systemic exposure 2 times that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Embryofetal Toxicity: tazarotene cream contains tazarotene, which is a teratogenic substance. Tazarotene cream is contraindicated in pregnancy. Females of child-bearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment and use an effective method of contraception during treatment. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Local Irritation: Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling. If these effects occur, discontinue until the integrity of the skin has been restored, or reduce dosing interval, or in the case of psoriasis, may switch to the lower concentration. Tazarotene cream should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. Tazarotene cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in orally treated animals. Tazarotene is a teratogenic substance, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . There were thirteen reported pregnancies in subjects who participated in the clinical trials for topical tazarotene. Nine of the subjects were found to have been treated with topical tazarotene, and the other four had been treated with vehicle. One of the subjects who was treated with tazarotene cream elected to terminate the pregnancy for non-medical reasons unrelated to treatment. The other eight pregnant women who were inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during clinical trials subsequently delivered apparently healthy babies. As the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation times are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. Females of Child-bearing Potential Females of child-bearing potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when tazarotene cream is used. The possibility that a female of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. A negative result for pregnancy test should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to tazarotene cream therapy. Tazarotene cream therapy should begin during a menstrual period [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.2 Local Irritation and Hypersensitivity Reactions Local tolerability reactions (including blistering and skin desquamation) and hypersensitivity adverse reactions (including urticaria) have been observed with topical tazarotene. Application of tazarotene cream may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive individuals. Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling. If these effects occur, the medication should either be discontinued until the integrity of the skin is restored, or the dosing should be reduced to an interval the patient can tolerate. However, efficacy at reduced frequency of application has not been established. Alternatively, patients with psoriasis who are being treated with the 0.1% concentration can be switched to the lower concentration. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Therapy can be resumed, or the drug concentration or frequency of application can be increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate treatment. Concomitant topical medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tazarotene cream is begun. Tazarotene cream, should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using tazarotene cream. 5.3 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of tazarotene cream. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using tazarotene cream. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use tazarotene cream until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using tazarotene cream. Tazarotene cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Embryofetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Photosensitivity and Risk of Sunburn [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Plaque psoriasis: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 23% of patients are pruritus, erythema, and burning. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Padagis \u00ae at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In human dermal safety trials, tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% did not induce allergic contact sensitization, phototoxicity, or photoallergy. Psoriasis The most frequent adverse reactions reported with tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% occurring in 10 to 23% of subjects, in descending order, included pruritus, erythema, and burning. Reactions occurring in greater than 1 to less than 10% of subjects, in descending order, included irritation, desquamation, stinging, contact dermatitis, dermatitis, eczema, worsening of psoriasis, skin pain, rash, hypertriglyceridemia, dry skin, skin inflammation, and peripheral edema. Tazarotene cream, 0.1% was associated with a greater degree of local irritation than the 0.05% cream. The rates of irritation adverse reactions reported during psoriasis trials with tazarotene cream, 0.1% were 0.1-0.4% higher than those reported for tazarotene cream, 0.05%. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tazarotene. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: blister, dermatitis, urticaria, skin exfoliation, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), swelling at or near application sites, and pain."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tazarotene cream. In a trial of 27 healthy female subjects between the ages of 20\u201355 years receiving a combination oral contraceptive tablet containing 1 mg norethindrone and 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol, concomitant use of tazarotene administered as 1.1 mg orally (mean \u00b1 SD C max and AUC 0-24 of tazarotenic acid were 28.9 \u00b1 9.4 ng/mL and 120.6 \u00b1 28.5 ng\u2022hr/mL) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol over a complete cycle. The impact of tazarotene on the pharmacokinetics of progestin only oral contraceptives (i.e., minipills) has not been evaluated."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from tazarotene cream during pregnancy; therefore, tazarotene cream should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Limited case reports of pregnancy in females enrolled in clinical trials for tazarotene cream have not established a clear association with tazarotene and major birth defects or miscarriage risk. Because the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestational age are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed topically during organogenesis at 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits dosed topically with tazarotene gel at 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, there was a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, tazarotene dosed orally during organogenesis at 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays. In pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed orally prior to mating through early gestation resulted in decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations at doses approximately 7 times higher than the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% [see Data] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In rats, a tazarotene gel, 0.05% formulation dosed topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day, which represented 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% (i.e., 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area), resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel, which represented 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, during gestation days 6 through 18, had a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats, and malformations and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses representing 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%. In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, classic developmental effects of retinoids were observed including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at that dose. In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of tazarotene gel (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival, but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the maximum systemic exposure in the rat would be equivalent to the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of tazarotene in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. After single topical doses of 14 C-tazarotene gel to the skin of lactating rats, radioactivity was detected in rat milk. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of tazarotene cream to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tazarotene cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tazarotene cream or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating tazarotene cream therapy which should begin during a menstrual period. Contraception Females Based on animal studies, tazarotene cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tazarotene cream. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tazarotene cream have not been established in patients with psoriasis under the age of 18 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials of tazarotene cream for plaque psoriasis, 120 were over the age of 65. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Currently there is no other clinical experience on the differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from tazarotene cream during pregnancy; therefore, tazarotene cream should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Limited case reports of pregnancy in females enrolled in clinical trials for tazarotene cream have not established a clear association with tazarotene and major birth defects or miscarriage risk. Because the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestational age are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed topically during organogenesis at 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits dosed topically with tazarotene gel at 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, there was a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, tazarotene dosed orally during organogenesis at 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays. In pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed orally prior to mating through early gestation resulted in decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations at doses approximately 7 times higher than the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% [see Data] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In rats, a tazarotene gel, 0.05% formulation dosed topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day, which represented 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% (i.e., 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area), resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel, which represented 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, during gestation days 6 through 18, had a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats, and malformations and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses representing 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%. In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, classic developmental effects of retinoids were observed including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at that dose. In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of tazarotene gel (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival, but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the maximum systemic exposure in the rat would be equivalent to the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3, but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3 and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Little parent compound could be detected in the plasma. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. The half-life of tazarotenic acid was approximately 18 hours, following topical application of tazarotene to normal or psoriatic skin. In a multiple dose trial with a once daily dose for 14 consecutive days in 9 psoriatic subjects (male=5; female=4), measured doses of tazarotene cream, 0.1% were applied by medical staff to involved skin without occlusion (5 to 35% of total body surface area: mean \u00b1 SD: 14 \u00b1 11%). The C max of tazarotenic acid was 2.31 \u00b1 2.78 ng/mL occurring 8 hours after the final dose, and the AUC 0-24h was 31.2 \u00b1 35.2 ng\u2022hr/mL on day 15 in the five subjects who were administered clinical doses of 2 mg cream/cm 2 . During clinical trials with tazarotene cream, 0.05% or 0.1% treatment for plaque psoriasis, three out of 139 subjects with their systemic exposure monitored had detectable plasma tazarotene concentrations, with the highest value at 0.09 ng/mL. Tazarotenic acid was detected in 78 out of 139 subjects (LLOQ = 0.05 ng/mL). Three subjects using tazarotene cream 0.1% had plasma tazarotenic acid concentrations greater than 1 ng/mL. The highest value was 2.4 ng/mL. However, because of the variations in the time of blood sampling, the area of psoriasis involvement, and the dose of tazarotene applied, actual maximal plasma levels are unknown."

Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in the rat equivalent to 0.6 times that seen in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/kg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study. A long-term topical application study of up to 0.1% of tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice terminated at 88 weeks showed that dose levels of 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared to vehicle control animals. Systemic exposures at the highest dose was 3.9 times that seen in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study. In evaluation of photo co-carcinogenicity, median time to onset of tumors was decreased, and the number of tumors increased in hairless mice following chronic topical dosing with intercurrent exposure to ultraviolet radiation at tazarotene concentrations of 0.001%, 0.005%, and 0.01% in a gel formulation for up to 40 weeks. Mutagenesis Tazarotene was found to be non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in a human lymphocyte assay. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility No impairment of fertility occurred in rats when male animals were treated for 70 days prior to mating and female animals were treated for 14 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation with topical doses of tazarotene gel up to 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat would be equivalent to 0.6 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in male rats treated for 70 days prior to mating with oral doses of up to 1 mg/kg/day tazarotene. That dose produced a systemic exposure that was 1.9 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in female rats treated for 15 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation day 7 with oral doses up to 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of estrous stages and an increase in developmental effects at that dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . That dose produced a systemic exposure that was 3.4 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area. Reproductive capabilities of F1 animals, including F2 survival and development, were not affected by topical administration of tazarotene gel to female F0 parental rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 at the maximum tolerated dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day.

Avoid accidental transfer of tazarotene gel into eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes. If contact with mucous membranes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Wash hands thoroughly after application. Apply a thin layer of tazarotene gel only to the affected area once daily in the evening. ( 2.1 ) Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. ( 2 ) If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water. ( 2 ) 2.1 Psoriasis It is recommended that treatment starts with tazarotene gel, 0.05%, with strength increased to 0.1% if tolerated and medically indicated. Apply a thin film (2 mg/cm 2 ) of tazarotene gel once per day, in the evening, to cover only the psoriatic lesions on no more than 20% of body surface area. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the gel. If emollients are used, they should be applied at least an hour before application of tazarotene gel. Because unaffected skin may be more susceptible to irritation, application of tazarotene to these areas should be carefully avoided. Tazarotene gel was investigated for up to 12 months during clinical trials for psoriasis."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryofetal Toxicity: Tazarotene gel contains tazarotene, which is a teratogen. Tazarotene gel is contraindicated in pregnancy. Females of child-bearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment and use an effective method of contraception during treatment. ( 5.1 ) Local Irritation: Excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling can occur. If these reactions occur, discontinue until the integrity of the skin has been restored, or consider reducing dosing frequency or in the case of psoriasis, consider switching to the lower concentration. Tazarotene gel should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. ( 5.2 ) Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. Tazarotene gel should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Tazarotene elicits malformations and developmental effects associated with retinoids after topical and oral administration to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis. Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in orally treated animals. Tazarotene is a teratogenic substance and causes fetal malformations in animals, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. There were thirteen reported pregnancies in subjects who participated in the clinical trials for topical tazarotene. Nine of the subjects had been treated with topical tazarotene, and the other four had been treated with vehicle. One of the subjects who was treated with tazarotene cream elected to terminate the pregnancy for non-medical reasons unrelated to treatment. The other eight pregnant women who were inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during the clinical trials subsequently delivered apparently healthy babies. As the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation times are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. Females of Child-bearing Potential Females of child-bearing potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when tazarotene gel is used. The possibility that a female of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. A negative result for pregnancy test should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to tazarotene gel therapy. Tazarotene gel therapy should begin during a normal menstrual period [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.2 Local Irritation and Hypersensitivity Reactions Application of tazarotene gel may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive individuals. Local reactions (including blistering and skin desquamation, pruritus, burning, erythema) and hypersensitivity adverse reactions (including urticaria) have been observed with topical tazarotene. If these adverse reactions occur, consider discontinuing the medication or reducing the dosing frequency, as appropriate, until the integrity of the skin is restored. Alternatively, patients with psoriasis who are being treated with the 0.1% concentration can be switched to the lower concentration. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Therapy can be resumed, or the drug concentration or frequency of application can be increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate treatment. Concomitant topical medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before treatment with tazarotene gel is initiated. Tazarotene gel, should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using tazarotene gel. 5.3 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of tazarotene gel. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using tazarotene gel. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use tazarotene gel until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using tazarotene gel. Tazarotene gel should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Embryofetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Photosensitivity and Risk of Sunburn [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Plaque Psoriasis: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 30% of patients are pruritus, burning/stinging, erythema, worsening of psoriasis, irritation, and skin pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cosette Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-922-1038 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Psoriasis A total of 439 subjects 14 to 87 years of age were treated with tazarotene gel, 0.05% and 0.1% in two controlled clinical trials. The most frequent adverse events reported with tazarotene gel, 0.05% and 0.1% occurring in 10 to 30% of subjects, in descending order, included pruritus, burning/stinging, erythema, worsening of psoriasis, irritation, and skin pain. Reactions occurring in 1 to 10% of subjects included rash, desquamation, irritant contact dermatitis, skin inflammation, fissuring, bleeding, and dry skin. Increases in \u201cpsoriasis worsening\u201d and \u201csun-induced erythema\u201d were noted in some subjects over the 4th to 12th months of treatment as compared to the first three months of a 1 year study. In general, the incidence of adverse events with tazarotene gel 0.05% was 2 to 5% lower than that seen with tazarotene gel 0.1%. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tazarotene. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: blister, dermatitis, urticaria, skin exfoliation, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), swelling at or near application sites, and pain."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from tazarotene gel during pregnancy; therefore, tazarotene gel should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Limited case reports of pregnancy in females enrolled in clinical trials for tazarotene gel have not established a clear association with tazarotene and major birth defects or miscarriage risk. Because the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestational age are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed topically during organogenesis at 0.5 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of tazarotene gel, 0.1% resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits dosed topically with tazarotene gel at 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, there were single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, tazarotene dosed orally during organogenesis at 0.5 and 13 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% resulted in malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays. In pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed orally prior to mating through early gestation resulted in decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations at doses approximately 2 times higher than the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% [see Data] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In rats, a tazarotene gel, 0.05% formulation dosed topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day, which represented 0.5 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% (i.e., 2 mg/cm 2 over a 20% body surface area), resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, during gestation days 6 through 18 were noted with single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats, and malformations and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing 0.5 and 13 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, which represented 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, classic developmental effects of retinoids were observed including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at that dose. In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of tazarotene gel (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival, but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the maximum systemic exposure in the rat would be 0.3 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of tazarotene in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. After single topical doses of 14 C-tazarotene gel to the skin of lactating rats, radioactivity was detected in rat milk. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of tazarotene gel to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tazarotene gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tazarotene gel or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating tazarotene gel therapy which should begin during a menstrual period. Contraception Females Based on animal studies, tazarotene gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tazarotene gel. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tazarotene gel have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriasis under the age of 12 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials of tazarotene gel for plaque psoriasis, 163 were over the age of 65. Subjects over 65 years of age experienced more adverse events and lower treatment success rates after 12 weeks of use of tazarotene gel compared with those 65 years of age and younger. Currently there is no other clinical experience on the differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3, but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3 and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings for the treatment of plaque psoriasis is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of tazarotene gel in the treatment of plaque psoriasis are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Little parent compound could be detected in the plasma. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. The half-life of tazarotenic acid was approximately 18 hours, following topical application of tazarotene to normal or psoriatic skin. The human in vivo studies described below were conducted with tazarotene gel applied topically at approximately 2 mg/cm 2 and left on the skin for 10 to 12 hours. Both the peak plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) refer to the active metabolite only. Two single, topical dose studies were conducted using 14 C-tazarotene gel. Systemic absorption, as determined from radioactivity in the excreta, was less than 1% of the applied dose (without occlusion) in six subjects with psoriasis and approximately 5% of the applied dose (under occlusion) in six healthy subjects. One non-radiolabeled single-dose study comparing the 0.05% gel to the 0.1% gel in healthy subjects indicated that the C max and AUC were 40% higher for the 0.1% gel. After 7 days of topical dosing with measured doses of tazarotene 0.1% gel on 20% of the total body surface without occlusion in 24 healthy subjects, the C max for tazarotenic acid was 0.72 \u00b1 0.58 ng/mL (mean \u00b1 SD) occurring 9 hours after the last dose, and the AUC 0-24hr for tazarotenic acid was 10.1 \u00b1 7.2 ng\u00b7hr/mL. Systemic absorption was 0.91 \u00b1 0.67% of the applied dose. In a 14-day study in five subjects with psoriasis, measured doses of tazarotene 0.1% gel were applied daily by nursing staff to involved skin without occlusion (8 to 18% of total body surface area; mean \u00b1 SD: 13 \u00b1 5%). The C max for tazarotenic acid was 12.0 \u00b1 7.6 ng/mL occurring 6 hours after the final dose, and the AUC 0-24hr for tazarotenic acid was 105 \u00b1 55 ng\u00b7hr/mL. Systemic absorption was 14.8 \u00b1 7.6% of the applied dose. Extrapolation of these results to represent dosing on 20% of total body surface yielded estimates for tazarotenic acid with C max of 18.9 \u00b1 10.6 ng/mL and AUC 0-24hr of 172 \u00b1 88 ng\u00b7hr/mL. An in vitro percutaneous absorption study, using radiolabeled drug and freshly excised human skin or human cadaver skin, indicated that approximately 4 to 5% of the applied dose was in the stratum corneum (tazarotene: tazarotenic acid = 5:1) and 2 to 4% was in the viable epidermis-dermis layer (tazarotene: tazarotenic acid = 2:1) 24 hours after topical application of the gel."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A long-term study of tazarotene following oral administration of 0.025, 0.050, and 0.125 mg/kg/day to rats showed no indications of increased carcinogenic risks. Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter-term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in the rat 0.3 times that seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. A long-term study with topical administration of up to 0.1% tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice terminated at 88 weeks showed that dose levels of 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared to vehicle control animals. Systemic exposure at the highest dose was 2 times that seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in a human lymphocyte assay. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. No impairment of fertility occurred in rats when male animals were treated for 70 days prior to mating and female animals were treated for 14 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation with topical doses of tazarotene gel up to 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat at the highest dose was 0.3 times that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in male rats treated for 70 days prior to mating with oral doses of up to 1 mg/kg/day tazarotene, which produced systemic exposure that was approximately equivalent to that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%.

( 1.1 ) Tazarotene gel, 0.1% is indicated for the topical treatment of mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris. ( 1.2 ) Limitations of Use The safety of tazarotene gel use on more than 20% body surface area has not been established. ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Plaque Psoriasis Tazarotene gel, 0.05% and 0.1% are indicated for the topical treatment of patients with plaque psoriasis of up to 20% body surface area involvement. 1.2 Acne Vulgaris Tazarotene gel, 0.1% is also indicated for the topical treatment of patients with facial acne vulgaris of mild to moderate severity. The efficacy of tazarotene gel in the treatment of acne previously treated with other retinoids or resistant to oral antibiotics has not been established. 1.3 Limitations of Use The safety of tazarotene gel use on more than 20% body surface area has not been established in psoriasis or acne [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tazarotene gel is for topical use only. Tazarotene gel is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. Avoid accidental transfer of tazarotene gel into eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes. If contact with mucous membranes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Wash hands thoroughly after application. Apply a thin layer of tazarotene gel only to the affected area once daily in the evening. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. ( 2.2 ) If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Psoriasis It is recommended that treatment starts with tazarotene gel, 0.05%, with strength increased to 0.1% if tolerated and medically indicated. Apply a thin film (2 mg/cm 2 ) of tazarotene gel once per day, in the evening, to cover only the psoriatic lesions on no more than 20% of body surface area. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the gel. If emollients are used, they should be applied at least an hour before application of tazarotene gel. Because unaffected skin may be more susceptible to irritation, application of tazarotene to these areas should be carefully avoided. Tazarotene gel was investigated for up to 12 months during clinical trials for psoriasis. 2.2 Acne Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer (2 mg/cm 2 ) of tazarotene gel 0.1% once per day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affected area. Tazarotene gel was investigated for up to 12 weeks during clinical trials for acne. Use effective sunscreens and wear protective clothing while using tazarotene gel [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] ."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryofetal Toxicity: Tazarotene gel contains tazarotene, which is a teratogen. Tazarotene gel is contraindicated in pregnancy. Females of child-bearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment and use an effective method of contraception during treatment. ( 5.1 ) Local Irritation: Excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling can occur. If these reactions occur, discontinue until the integrity of the skin has been restored, or consider reducing dosing frequency or in the case of psoriasis, consider switching to the lower concentration. Tazarotene gel should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. ( 5.2 ) Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. Tazarotene gel should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Tazarotene elicits malformations and developmental effects associated with retinoids after topical and oral administration to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis. Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in orally treated animals. Although there may be less systemic exposure in the treatment of acne of the face alone due to less surface area for application, tazarotene is a teratogenic substance and causes fetal malformations in animals, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . There were thirteen reported pregnancies in subjects who participated in the clinical trials for topical tazarotene. Nine of the subjects had been treated with topical tazarotene, and the other four had been treated with vehicle. One of the subjects who was treated with tazarotene cream elected to terminate the pregnancy for non-medical reasons unrelated to treatment. The other eight pregnant women who were inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during the clinical trials subsequently delivered apparently healthy babies. As the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation times are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. Females of Child-bearing Potential Females of child-bearing potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when tazarotene gel is used. The possibility that a female of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. A negative result for pregnancy test should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to tazarotene gel therapy. Tazarotene gel therapy should begin during a normal menstrual period [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.2 Local Irritation and Hypersensitivity Reactions Application of tazarotene gel may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive individuals. Local reactions (including blistering and skin desquamation, pruritus, burning, erythema) and hypersensitivity adverse reactions (including urticaria) have been observed with topical tazarotene. If these adverse reactions occur, consider discontinuing the medication or reducing the dosing frequency, as appropriate, until the integrity of the skin is restored. Alternatively, patients with psoriasis who are being treated with the 0.1% concentration can be switched to the lower concentration. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Therapy can be resumed, or the drug concentration or frequency of application can be increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate treatment. Concomitant topical medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before treatment with tazarotene gel is initiated. Tazarotene gel, should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using tazarotene gel. 5.3 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of tazarotene gel. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using tazarotene gel. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use tazarotene gel until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using tazarotene gel. Tazarotene gel should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Embryofetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Photosensitivity and Risk of Sunburn [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Plaque Psoriasis: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 30% of patients are pruritus, burning/stinging, erythema, worsening of psoriasis, irritation, and skin pain. ( 6.1 ) Acne Vulgaris: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 30% of patients are desquamation, burning/stinging, dry skin, erythema and pruritus. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Solaris Pharma Corporation at 1-833-919-0527 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Psoriasis A total of 439 subjects 14 to 87 years of age were treated with tazarotene gel, 0.05% and 0.1% in two controlled clinical trials. The most frequent adverse events reported with tazarotene gel, 0.05% and 0.1% occurring in 10 to 30% of subjects, in descending order, included pruritus, burning/stinging, erythema, worsening of psoriasis, irritation, and skin pain. Reactions occurring in 1 to 10% of subjects included rash, desquamation, irritant contact dermatitis, skin inflammation, fissuring, bleeding, and dry skin. Increases in \"psoriasis worsening\" and \"sun-induced erythema\" were noted in some subjects over the 4th to 12th months of treatment as compared to the first three months of a 1 year study. In general, the incidence of adverse events with tazarotene gel 0.05% was 2 to 5% lower than that seen with tazarotene gel 0.1%. Acne A total of 596 subjects 12 to 44 years of age were treated with tazarotene gel, 0.05% and 0.1% in two controlled clinical trials. The most frequent adverse events reported during clinical trials with tazarotene gel, 0.1% in the treatment of acne occurring in 10 to 30% of subjects, in descending order, included desquamation, burning/stinging, dry skin, erythema and pruritus. Reactions occurring in 1 to 10% of subjects included irritation, skin pain, fissuring, localized edema and skin discoloration. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tazarotene. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: blister, dermatitis, urticaria, skin exfoliation, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), swelling at or near application sites, and pain."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from tazarotene gel during pregnancy; therefore, tazarotene gel should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Limited case reports of pregnancy in females enrolled in clinical trials for tazarotene gel have not established a clear association with tazarotene and major birth defects or miscarriage risk. Because the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestational age are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed topically during organogenesis at 0.5 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of tazarotene gel, 0.1% resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits dosed topically with tazarotene gel at 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, there were single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, tazarotene dosed orally during organogenesis at 0.5 and 13 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% resulted in malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays. In pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed orally prior to mating through early gestation resulted in decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations at doses approximately 2 times higher than the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% [see Data] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In rats, a tazarotene gel, 0.05% formulation dosed topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day, which represented 0.5 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% (i.e., 2 mg/cm 2 over a 20% body surface area), resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, during gestation days 6 through 18 were noted with single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats, and malformations and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing 0.5 and 13 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, which represented 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, classic developmental effects of retinoids were observed including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at that dose. In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of tazarotene gel (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival, but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the maximum systemic exposure in the rat would be 0.3 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of tazarotene in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. After single topical doses of 14 C-tazarotene gel to the skin of lactating rats, radioactivity was detected in rat milk. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of tazarotene gel to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tazarotene gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tazarotene gel or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating tazarotene gel therapy which should begin during a menstrual period. Contraception Females Based on animal studies, tazarotene gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tazarotene gel. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tazarotene gel have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriasis or acne under the age of 12 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials of tazarotene gel for plaque psoriasis, 163 were over the age of 65. Subjects over 65 years of age experienced more adverse events and lower treatment success rates after 12 weeks of use of tazarotene gel compared with those 65 years of age and younger. Currently there is no other clinical experience on the differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Tazarotene gel for the treatment of acne has not been clinically evaluated in persons over the age of 65."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3, but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3 and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and facial acne vulgaris is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of tazarotene gel in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and facial acne vulgaris are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Little parent compound could be detected in the plasma. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. The half-life of tazarotenic acid was approximately 18 hours, following topical application of tazarotene to normal, acne or psoriatic skin. The human in vivo studies described below were conducted with tazarotene gel applied topically at approximately 2 mg/cm 2 and left on the skin for 10 to 12 hours. Both the peak plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) refer to the active metabolite only. Two single, topical dose studies were conducted using 14 C-tazarotene gel. Systemic absorption, as determined from radioactivity in the excreta, was less than 1% of the applied dose (without occlusion) in six subjects with psoriasis and approximately 5% of the applied dose (under occlusion) in six healthy subjects. One non-radiolabeled single-dose study comparing the 0.05% gel to the 0.1% gel in healthy subjects indicated that the C max and AUC were 40% higher for the 0.1% gel. After 7 days of topical dosing with measured doses of tazarotene 0.1% gel on 20% of the total body surface without occlusion in 24 healthy subjects, the C max for tazarotenic acid was 0.72 \u00b1 0.58 ng/mL (mean \u00b1 SD) occurring 9 hours after the last dose, and the AUC 0-24hr for tazarotenic acid was 10.1 \u00b1 7.2 ng\u00b7hr/mL. Systemic absorption was 0.91 \u00b1 0.67% of the applied dose. In a 14-day study in five subjects with psoriasis, measured doses of tazarotene 0.1% gel were applied daily by nursing staff to involved skin without occlusion (8 to 18% of total body surface area; mean \u00b1 SD: 13 \u00b1 5%). The C max for tazarotenic acid was 12.0 \u00b1 7.6 ng/mL occurring 6 hours after the final dose, and the AUC 0-24hr for tazarotenic acid was 105 \u00b1 55 ng\u00b7hr/mL. Systemic absorption was 14.8 \u00b1 7.6% of the applied dose. Extrapolation of these results to represent dosing on 20% of total body surface yielded estimates for tazarotenic acid with C max of 18.9 \u00b1 10.6 ng/mL and AUC 0-24hr of 172 \u00b1 88 ng\u00b7hr/mL. An in vitro percutaneous absorption study, using radiolabeled drug and freshly excised human skin or human cadaver skin, indicated that approximately 4 to 5% of the applied dose was in the stratum corneum (tazarotene: tazarotenic acid = 5:1) and 2 to 4% was in the viable epidermis-dermis layer (tazarotene: tazarotenic acid = 2:1) 24 hours after topical application of the gel."

Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter-term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in the rat 0.3 times that seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. A long-term study with topical administration of up to 0.1% tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice terminated at 88 weeks showed that dose levels of 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared to vehicle control animals. Systemic exposure at the highest dose was 2 times that seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in a human lymphocyte assay. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. No impairment of fertility occurred in rats when male animals were treated for 70 days prior to mating and female animals were treated for 14 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation with topical doses of tazarotene gel up to 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat at the highest dose was 0.3 times that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in male rats treated for 70 days prior to mating with oral doses of up to 1 mg/kg/day tazarotene, which produced systemic exposure that was approximately equivalent to that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in female rats treated for 15 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation day 7 with oral doses of tazarotene up to 2 mg/kg/day. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of estrous stages and an increase in developmental effects at that dose, which produced systemic exposure 2 times that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] ."

( 2.2 ) If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Tazarotene cream is for topical use only. Tazarotene cream is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. If contact with mucous membranes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Wash hands thoroughly after application. 2.2 Psoriasis It is recommended that treatment starts with tazarotene cream, 0.05%, with strength increased to 0.1% if tolerated and medically indicated. Apply a thin film (2 mg/cm 2 ) of tazarotene cream once per day, in the evening, to cover only the psoriatic lesions. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the cream. If emollients are used, they should be applied at least an hour before application of tazarotene cream. Because unaffected skin may be more susceptible to irritation, application of tazarotene cream to these areas should be carefully avoided. 2.3 Acne Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer (2 mg/cm 2 ) of tazarotene cream 0.1% once per day, in the evening, to the skin areas where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affected area. Use effective sunscreens and wear protective clothing while using tazarotene cream [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryofetal Toxicity: Tazarotene cream contains tazarotene, which is a teratogenic substance. Tazarotene cream is contraindicated in pregnancy. Females of child-bearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment and use an effective method of contraception during treatment. ( 5.1 ) Local Irritation: Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling. If these effects occur, discontinue until the integrity of the skin has been restored, or reduce dosing interval, or in the case of psoriasis, may switch to the lower concentration. Tazarotene cream should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. ( 5.2 ) Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. Tazarotene cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in orally treated animals. Although there may be less systemic exposure in the treatment of acne of the face alone due to less surface area for application, tazarotene is a teratogenic substance, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . There were thirteen reported pregnancies in subjects who participated in the clinical trials for topical tazarotene. Nine of the subjects were found to have been treated with topical tazarotene, and the other four had been treated with vehicle. One of the subjects who was treated with tazarotene cream elected to terminate the pregnancy for non-medical reasons unrelated to treatment. The other eight pregnant women who were inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during clinical trials subsequently delivered apparently healthy babies. As the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation times are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. Females of Child-bearing Potential Females of child-bearing potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when tazarotene cream is used. The possibility that a female of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. A negative result for pregnancy test should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to tazarotene cream therapy. Tazarotene cream therapy should begin during a menstrual period [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.2 Local Irritation and Hypersensitivity Reactions Local tolerability reactions (including blistering and skin desquamation) and hypersensitivity adverse reactions (including urticaria) have been observed with topical tazarotene. Application of tazarotene cream may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive individuals. Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling. If these effects occur, the medication should either be discontinued until the integrity of the skin is restored, or the dosing should be reduced to an interval the patient can tolerate. However, efficacy at reduced frequency of application has not been established. Alternatively, patients with psoriasis who are being treated with the 0.1% concentration can be switched to the lower concentration. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Therapy can be resumed, or the drug concentration or frequency of application can be increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate treatment. Concomitant topical medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tazarotene cream is begun. Tazarotene cream, should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using tazarotene cream. 5.3 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of tazarotene cream. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using tazarotene cream. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use tazarotene cream until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using tazarotene cream. Tazarotene cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Embryofetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Photosensitivity and Risk of Sunburn [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Plaque psoriasis: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 23% of patients are pruritus, erythema, and burning. ( 6.1 ) Acne Vulgaris: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 30% of patients are desquamation, dry skin, erythema, and burning sensation. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cosette Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-922-1038 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In human dermal safety trials, tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% did not induce allergic contact sensitization, phototoxicity, or photoallergy. Psoriasis The most frequent adverse reactions reported with tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% occurring in 10 to 23% of subjects, in descending order, included pruritus, erythema, and burning. Reactions occurring in greater than 1 to less than 10% of subjects, in descending order, included irritation, desquamation, stinging, contact dermatitis, dermatitis, eczema, worsening of psoriasis, skin pain, rash, hypertriglyceridemia, dry skin, skin inflammation, and peripheral edema. Tazarotene cream, 0.1% was associated with a greater degree of local irritation than the 0.05% cream. The rates of irritation adverse reactions reported during psoriasis trials with tazarotene cream, 0.1% were 0.1-0.4% higher than those reported for tazarotene cream, 0.05%. Acne The most frequent adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with tazarotene cream 0.1% in the treatment of acne, occurring in 10-30% of subjects, in descending order included desquamation, dry skin, erythema, and burning sensation. Reactions occurring in 1 to 5% of subjects included pruritus, irritation, face pain, and stinging. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tazarotene. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : blister, dermatitis, urticaria, skin exfoliation, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), swelling at or near application sites, and pain."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from tazarotene cream during pregnancy; therefore, tazarotene cream should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Limited case reports of pregnancy in females enrolled in clinical trials for tazarotene cream have not established a clear association with tazarotene and major birth defects or miscarriage risk. Because the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestational age are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown . In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed topically during organogenesis at 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits dosed topically with tazarotene gel at 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, there was a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, tazarotene dosed orally during organogenesis at 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays . In pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed orally prior to mating through early gestation resulted in decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations at doses approximately 7 times higher than the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% [see Data ]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In rats, a tazarotene gel, 0.05% formulation dosed topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day, which represented 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% (i.e . , 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area), resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel, which represented 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, during gestation days 6 through 18, had a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats, and malformations and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses representing 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%. In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, classic developmental effects of retinoids were observed including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at that dose. In a pre-and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of tazarotene gel (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival, but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the maximum systemic exposure in the rat would be equivalent to the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of tazarotene in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. After single topical doses of 14 C-tazarotene gel to the skin of lactating rats, radioactivity was detected in rat milk. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of tazarotene cream to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tazarotene cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tazarotene cream or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating tazarotene cream therapy which should begin during a menstrual period. Contraception Females Based on animal studies, tazarotene cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tazarotene cream. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tazarotene cream have not been established in patients with psoriasis under the age of 18 years, or in patients with acne under the age of 12 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tazarotene cream for the treatment of acne has not been clinically tested in persons 65 years of age or older. Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials of tazarotene cream for plaque psoriasis, 120 were over the age of 65. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Currently there is no other clinical experience on the differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1 RAR\u03b2, and RAR \u03b3 , but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2, and RAR \u03b3 and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Little parent compound could be detected in the plasma. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. The half-life of tazarotenic acid was approximately 18 hours, following topical application of tazarotene to normal, acne or psoriatic skin. In a multiple dose trial with a once daily dose for 14 consecutive days in 9 psoriatic subjects (male=5; female=4), measured doses of tazarotene cream, 0.1% were applied by medical staff to involved skin without occlusion (5 to 35% of total body surface area: mean \u00b1 SD: 14 \u00b1 11%). The C max of tazarotenic acid was 2.31 \u00b1 2.78 ng/mL occurring 8 hours after the final dose, and the AUC 0-24h was 31.2 \u00b1 35.2 ng\u00b7hr/mL on day 15 in the five subjects who were administered clinical doses of 2 mg cream/cm 2 . During clinical trials with tazarotene cream, 0.05% or 0.1% treatment for plaque psoriasis, three out of 139 subjects with their systemic exposure monitored had detectable plasma tazarotene concentrations, with the highest value at 0.09 ng/mL. Tazarotenic acid was detected in 78 out of 139 subjects (LLOQ = 0.05 ng/mL). Three subjects using tazarotene cream 0.1% had plasma tazarotenic acid concentrations greater than 1 ng/mL. The highest value was 2.4 ng/mL. However, because of the variations in the time of blood sampling, the area of psoriasis involvement, and the dose of tazarotene applied, actual maximal plasma levels are unknown. Tazarotene cream 0.1% was applied once daily to either the face (N=8) or to 15% of body surface area (N=10) of female subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris. The mean C max and AUC values of tazarotenic acid peaked at day 15 for both dosing groups during a 29 day treatment period. Mean C max and AUC 0-24h values of tazarotenic acid from subjects in the 15% body surface area dosing group were more than 10 times higher than those from subjects in the face-only dosing group. The single highest C max throughout the trial period was 1.91 ng/mL on day 15 in the exaggerated dosing group. In the face-only group, the mean \u00b1 SD values of C max and AUC 0-24h of tazarotenic acid on day 15 were 0.10 \u00b1 0.06 ng/mL and 1.54 \u00b1 1.01 ng\u00b7hr/mL, respectively, whereas in the 15% body surface area dosing group, the mean \u00b1 SD values of C max and AUC 0-24h of tazarotenic acid on day 15 were 1.20 \u00b1 0.41 ng/mL and 17.01 \u00b1 6.15 ng\u00b7hr/mL, respectively. The steady state pharmacokinetics of tazarotenic acid had been reached by day 8 in the face-only and by day 15 in the 15% body surface area dosing groups. In a Phase 3 clinical trial, tazarotene cream, 0.1% was applied once daily for 12 weeks to each of 48 subjects (22 females and 26 males) with facial acne vulgaris. The mean \u00b1 SD values of plasma tazarotenic acid at weeks 4 and 8 were 0.078 \u00b1 0.073 ng/mL (N=47) and 0.052 \u00b1 0.037 ng/mL (N=42), respectively. The highest observed individual plasma tazarotenic acid concentration was 0.41 ng/mL at week 4 from a female subject. The magnitude of plasma tazarotenic acid concentrations appears to be independent of gender, age, and body weight."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis A long-term study of tazarotene following oral administration of 0.025, 0.050, and 0.125 mg/kg/day to rats showed no indications of increased carcinogenic risks. Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in the rat equivalent to 0.6 times that seen in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/kg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study. This estimated systemic exposure in rats was 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area. A long-term topical application study of up to 0.1% of tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice terminated at 88 weeks showed that dose levels of 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared to vehicle control animals. Systemic exposures at the highest dose was 3.9 times that seen in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study, and 13 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area. In evaluation of photo co-carcinogenicity, median time to onset of tumors was decreased, and the number of tumors increased in hairless mice following chronic topical dosing with intercurrent exposure to ultraviolet radiation at tazarotene concentrations of 0.001%, 0.005%, and 0.01% in a gel formulation for up to 40 weeks. Mutagenesis Tazarotene was found to be non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in a human lymphocyte assay. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility No impairment of fertility occurred in rats when male animals were treated for 70 days prior to mating and female animals were treated for 14 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation with topical doses of tazarotene gel up to 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat would be equivalent to 0.6 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area in a controlled pharmacokinetic study, and 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in male rats treated for 70 days prior to mating with oral doses of up to 1 mg/kg/day tazarotene. That dose produced a systemic exposure that was 1.9 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area, and 6.3 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in female rats treated for 15 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation day 7 with oral doses up to 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of estrous stages and an increase in developmental effects at that dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . That dose produced a systemic exposure that was 3.4 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area and 11 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area. Reproductive capabilities of F1 animals, including F2 survival and development, were not affected by topical administration of tazarotene gel to female F0 parental rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 at the maximum tolerated dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat would be equivalent to 0.6 times that observed in a psoriatic patient treated with 0.1% tazarotene cream at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 35% body surface area, and 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in acne patients treated with tazarotene cream, 0.1% at 2 mg/cm 2 over a 15% body surface area."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tazarotene gel is for topical use only. Tazarotene gel is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. Avoid accidental transfer of tazarotene gel into eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes. If contact with mucous membranes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Wash hands thoroughly after application. \u2022 Apply a thin layer of tazarotene gel only to the affected area once daily in the evening. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) \u2022 Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Psoriasis It is recommended that treatment starts with tazarotene gel, 0.05%, with strength increased to 0.1% if tolerated and medically indicated. Apply a thin film (2 mg/cm 2 ) of tazarotene gel once per day, in the evening, to cover only the psoriatic lesions on no more than 20% of body surface area. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the gel. If emollients are used, they should be applied at least an hour before application of tazarotene gel. Because unaffected skin may be more susceptible to irritation, application of tazarotene to these areas should be carefully avoided. Tazarotene gel was investigated for up to 12 months during clinical trials for psoriasis. 2.2 Acne Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer (2 mg/cm 2 ) of tazarotene gel 0.1% once per day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affected area. Tazarotene gel was investigated for up to 12 weeks during clinical trials for acne. Use effective sunscreens and wear protective clothing while using tazarotene gel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Embryofetal Toxicity: Tazarotene gel contains tazarotene, which is a teratogen. Tazarotene gel is contraindicated in pregnancy. Females of child-bearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment and use an effective method of contraception during treatment. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Local Irritation: Excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling can occur. If these reactions occur, discontinue until the integrity of the skin has been restored, or consider reducing dosing frequency or in the case of psoriasis, consider switching to the lower concentration. Tazarotene gel should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. Tazarotene gel should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Tazarotene elicits malformations and developmental effects associated with retinoids after topical and oral administration to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis. Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in orally treated animals. Although there may be less systemic exposure in the treatment of acne of the face alone due to less surface area for application, tazarotene is a teratogenic substance and causes fetal malformations in animals, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . There were thirteen reported pregnancies in subjects who participated in the clinical trials for topical tazarotene. Nine of the subjects had been treated with topical tazarotene, and the other four had been treated with vehicle. One of the subjects who was treated with tazarotene cream elected to terminate the pregnancy for non-medical reasons unrelated to treatment. The other eight pregnant women who were inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during the clinical trials subsequently delivered apparently healthy babies. As the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation times are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. Females of Child-bearing Potential Females of child-bearing potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when tazarotene gel is used. The possibility that a female of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. A negative result for pregnancy test should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to tazarotene gel therapy. Tazarotene gel therapy should begin during a normal menstrual period [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . 5.2 Local Irritation and Hypersensitivity Reactions Application of tazarotene gel may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive individuals. Local reactions (including blistering and skin desquamation, pruritus, burning, erythema) and hypersensitivity adverse reactions (including urticaria) have been observed with topical tazarotene. If these adverse reactions occur, consider discontinuing the medication or reducing the dosing frequency, as appropriate, until the integrity of the skin is restored. Alternatively, patients with psoriasis who are being treated with the 0.1% concentration can be switched to the lower concentration. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Therapy can be resumed, or the drug concentration or frequency of application can be increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate treatment. Concomitant topical medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before treatment with tazarotene gel is initiated. Tazarotene gel, should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using tazarotene gel. 5.3 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of tazarotene gel. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using tazarotene gel. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use tazarotene gel until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using tazarotene gel. Tazarotene gel should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity."

( 6.1 ) \u2022 Acne Vulgaris: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 30% of patients are desquamation, burning/stinging, dry skin, erythema and pruritus. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Padagis \u00ae at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Psoriasis A total of 439 subjects 14 to 87 years of age were treated with tazarotene gel, 0.05% and 0.1% in two controlled clinical trials. The most frequent adverse events reported with tazarotene gel, 0.05% and 0.1% occurring in 10 to 30% of subjects, in descending order, included pruritus, burning/stinging, erythema, worsening of psoriasis, irritation, and skin pain. Reactions occurring in 1 to 10% of subjects included rash, desquamation, irritant contact dermatitis, skin inflammation, fissuring, bleeding, and dry skin. Increases in \u201cpsoriasis worsening\u201d and \u201csun-induced erythema\u201d were noted in some subjects over the 4th to 12th months of treatment as compared to the first three months of a 1 year study. In general, the incidence of adverse events with tazarotene gel 0.05% was 2 to 5% lower than that seen with tazarotene gel 0.1%. Acne A total of 596 subjects 12 to 44 years of age were treated with tazarotene gel, 0.05% and 0.1% in two controlled clinical trials. The most frequent adverse events reported during clinical trials with tazarotene gel, 0.1% in the treatment of acne occurring in 10 to 30% of subjects, in descending order, included desquamation, burning/stinging, dry skin, erythema and pruritus. Reactions occurring in 1 to 10% of subjects included irritation, skin pain, fissuring, localized edema and skin discoloration. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tazarotene. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: blister, dermatitis, urticaria, skin exfoliation, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), swelling at or near application sites, and pain."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from tazarotene gel during pregnancy; therefore, tazarotene gel should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Limited case reports of pregnancy in females enrolled in clinical trials for tazarotene gel have not established a clear association with tazarotene and major birth defects or miscarriage risk. Because the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestational age are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed topically during organogenesis at 0.5 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of tazarotene gel, 0.1% resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits dosed topically with tazarotene gel at 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, there were single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, tazarotene dosed orally during organogenesis at 0.5 and 13 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% resulted in malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays. In pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed orally prior to mating through early gestation resulted in decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations at doses approximately 2 times higher than the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% [see Data] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In rats, a tazarotene gel, 0.05% formulation dosed topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day, which represented 0.5 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% (i.e., 2 mg/cm 2 over a 20% body surface area), resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, during gestation days 6 through 18 were noted with single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies. When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats, and malformations and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing 0.5 and 13 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, which represented 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, classic developmental effects of retinoids were observed including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at that dose. In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of tazarotene gel (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival, but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the maximum systemic exposure in the rat would be 0.3 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of tazarotene in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. After single topical doses of 14 C-tazarotene gel to the skin of lactating rats, radioactivity was detected in rat milk. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of tazarotene gel to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tazarotene gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tazarotene gel or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating tazarotene gel therapy which should begin during a menstrual period. Contraception Females Based on animal studies, tazarotene gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tazarotene gel. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tazarotene gel have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriasis or acne under the age of 12 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials of tazarotene gel for plaque psoriasis, 163 were over the age of 65. Subjects over 65 years of age experienced more adverse events and lower treatment success rates after 12 weeks of use of tazarotene gel compared with those 65 years of age and younger. Currently there is no other clinical experience on the differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Tazarotene gel for the treatment of acne has not been clinically evaluated in persons over the age of 65."

Currently there is no other clinical experience on the differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Tazarotene gel for the treatment of acne has not been clinically evaluated in persons over the age of 65."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3, but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3 and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and facial acne vulgaris is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of tazarotene gel in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and facial acne vulgaris are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Little parent compound could be detected in the plasma. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. The half-life of tazarotenic acid was approximately 18 hours, following topical application of tazarotene to normal, acne or psoriatic skin. The human in vivo studies described below were conducted with tazarotene gel applied topically at approximately 2 mg/cm 2 and left on the skin for 10 to 12 hours. Both the peak plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) refer to the active metabolite only. Two single, topical dose studies were conducted using 14 C-tazarotene gel. Systemic absorption, as determined from radioactivity in the excreta, was less than 1% of the applied dose (without occlusion) in six subjects with psoriasis and approximately 5% of the applied dose (under occlusion) in six healthy subjects. One non-radiolabeled single-dose study comparing the 0.05% gel to the 0.1% gel in healthy subjects indicated that the C max and AUC were 40% higher for the 0.1% gel. After 7 days of topical dosing with measured doses of tazarotene 0.1% gel on 20% of the total body surface without occlusion in 24 healthy subjects, the C max for tazarotenic acid was 0.72 \u00b1 0.58 ng/mL (mean \u00b1 SD) occurring 9 hours after the last dose, and the AUC 0-24hr for tazarotenic acid was 10.1 \u00b1 7.2 ng\u00b7hr/mL. Systemic absorption was 0.91 \u00b1 0.67% of the applied dose. In a 14-day study in five subjects with psoriasis, measured doses of tazarotene 0.1% gel were applied daily by nursing staff to involved skin without occlusion (8 to 18% of total body surface area; mean \u00b1 SD: 13 \u00b1 5%). The C max for tazarotenic acid was 12.0 \u00b1 7.6 ng/mL occurring 6 hours after the final dose, and the AUC 0-24hr for tazarotenic acid was 105 \u00b1 55 ng\u00b7hr/mL. Systemic absorption was 14.8 \u00b1 7.6% of the applied dose. Extrapolation of these results to represent dosing on 20% of total body surface yielded estimates for tazarotenic acid with C max of 18.9 \u00b1 10.6 ng/mL and AUC 0-24hr of 172 \u00b1 88 ng\u00b7hr/mL. An in vitro percutaneous absorption study, using radiolabeled drug and freshly excised human skin or human cadaver skin, indicated that approximately 4 to 5% of the applied dose was in the stratum corneum (tazarotene: tazarotenic acid = 5:1) and 2 to 4% was in the viable epidermis-dermis layer (tazarotene: tazarotenic acid = 2:1) 24 hours after topical application of the gel."

Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter-term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in the rat 0.3 times that seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. A long-term study with topical administration of up to 0.1% tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice terminated at 88 weeks showed that dose levels of 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared to vehicle control animals. Systemic exposure at the highest dose was 2 times that seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in a human lymphocyte assay. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. No impairment of fertility occurred in rats when male animals were treated for 70 days prior to mating and female animals were treated for 14 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation with topical doses of tazarotene gel up to 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat at the highest dose was 0.3 times that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in male rats treated for 70 days prior to mating with oral doses of up to 1 mg/kg/day tazarotene, which produced systemic exposure that was approximately equivalent to that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%. No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in female rats treated for 15 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation day 7 with oral doses of tazarotene up to 2 mg/kg/day. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of estrous stages and an increase in developmental effects at that dose, which produced systemic exposure 2 times that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] ."
