    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Thiotepa is a cytotoxic agent of the polyfunctional type, related chemically and pharmacologically to nitrogen mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethylenimine radicals which, like irradiation, disrupt the bonds of DNA. One of the principal bond disruptions is initiated by alkylation of guanine at the N-7 position, which severs the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberates alkylated guanines. The pharmacokinetics of thiotepa and TEPA in thirteen female patients (45 to 84 years) with advanced stage ovarian cancer receiving 60 mg and 80 mg thiotepa by intravenous infusion on subsequent courses given at 4 week intervals are presented in the following table: Pharmacokinetic Parameters (units) Mean \u00b1 SEM Thiotepa TEPA 60 mg 80 mg 60 mg 80 mg Peak Serum concentration (ng/mL) 1331 \u00b1 119 1828 \u00b1 135 273 \u00b1 46 353 \u00b1 46 Elimination half-life (h) 2.4 \u00b1 0.3 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 17.6 \u00b1 3.6 15.7 \u00b1 2.7 Area under the curve (ng/h/mL) 2832 \u00b1 412 4127 \u00b1 668 4789 \u00b1 1022 7452 \u00b1 1667 Total body clearance (mL/min) 446 \u00b1 63 419 \u00b1 56 TEPA, which possesses cytotoxic activity, appears to be the major metabolite of thiotepa found in human serum and urine. Urinary excretion of 14 C-labeled thiotepa and metabolites in a 34-year old patient with metastatic carcinoma of the cecum who received a dose of 0.3 mg/kg intravenously was 63%. Thiotepa and TEPA in urine each accounts for less than 2% of the administered dose. The pharmacokinetics of thiotepa in renal and hepatic dysfunction patients have not been evaluated. Possible pharmacokinetic interactions of thiotepa with any concomitantly administered medications have not been formally investigated."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Thiotepa for Injection, USP has been tried with varying results in the palliation of a wide variety of neoplastic diseases. However, the most consistent results have been seen in the following tumors: 1. Adenocarcinoma of the breast. 2. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 3. For controlling intracavitary effusions secondary to diffuse or localized neoplastic diseases of various serosal cavities. 4. For the treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder. While now largely superseded by other treatments, thiotepa has been effective against other lymphomas, such as lymphosarcoma and Hodgkin\u2019s disease."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Thiotepa is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to this preparation. Therapy is probably contraindicated in cases of existing hepatic, renal, or bone-marrow damage. However, if the need outweighs the risk in such patients, thiotepa may be used in low dosage, and accompanied by hepatic, renal and hemopoietic function tests."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Death has occurred after intravesical administration, caused by bone-marrow depression from systematically absorbed drug. Death from septicemia and hemorrhage has occurred as a direct result of hematopoietic depression by thiotepa. Thiotepa is highly toxic to the hematopoietic system. A rapidly falling white blood cell or platelet count indicates the necessity for discontinuing or reducing the dosage of thiotepa. Weekly blood and platelet counts are recommended during therapy and for at least 3 weeks after therapy has been discontinued. Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal (IP) route was teratogenic in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (0.8 mg/kg, 27 mg/m 2 ), based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Effective contraception should be used during thiotepa therapy if either the patient or partner is of childbearing potential. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If thiotepa is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs during thiotepa therapy, the patient and partner should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Thiotepa is a polyfunctional alkylating agent, capable of cross-linking the DNA within a cell and changing its nature. The replication of the cell is, therefore, altered, and thiotepa may be described as mutagenic. An in vitro study has shown that it causes chromosomal aberrations of the chromatid type and that the frequency of induced aberrations increases with the age of the subject. Like many alkylating agents, thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals. Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice, but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man. In patients treated with thiotepa, cases of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia have been reported."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The serious complication of excessive thiotepa therapy, or sensitivity to the effects of thiotepa, is bone-marrow depression. If proper precautions are not observed thiotepa may cause leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Information for Patients The patient should notify the physician in the case of any sign of bleeding (epistaxis, easy bruising, change in color of urine, black stool) or infection (fever, chills) or for possible pregnancy to patient or partner. Effective contraception should be used during thiotepa therapy if either the patient or the partner is of childbearing potential. Laboratory Tests The most reliable guide to thiotepa toxicity is the white blood cell count. If this falls to 3000 or less, the dose should be discontinued. Another good index of thiotepa toxicity is the platelet count; if this falls to 150,000, therapy should be discontinued. Red blood cell count is a less accurate indicator of thiotepa toxicity. If the drug is used in patients with hepatic or renal damage (see CONTRAINDICATIONS section), regular assessment of hepatic and renal function tests are indicated. Drug Interactions It is not advisable to combine, simultaneously or sequentially, cancer chemotherapeutic agents or a cancer chemotherapeutic agent and a therapeutic modality having the same mechanism of action. Therefore, thiotepa combined with other alkylating agents such as nitrogen mustard or cyclophosphamide or thiotepa combined with irradiation would serve to intensify toxicity rather than to enhance therapeutic response. If these agents must follow each other, it is important that recovery from the first agent, as indicated by white blood cell count, be complete before therapy with the second agent is instituted. Other drugs which are known to produce bone-marrow depression should be avoided. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (1.15 or 2.3 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 43 weeks, respectively) produced a significant increase in the combined incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin, preputial gland, and ear canal, and combined incidence of lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia. In other studies in mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (4 or 8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 20-week observation period or 1.8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 35-week observation period) resulted in an increased incidence of lung tumors. In rats, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (0.7 or 1.4 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 34 weeks, respectively) produced significant increases in the incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin or ear canal, combined hematopoietic neoplasms, and uterine adenocarcinomas. Thiotepa given intravenously (IV) to rats (1 mg/kg once per week for 52 weeks) produced an increased incidence of malignant tumors (abdominal cavity sarcoma, lymphosarcoma myelosis, seminoma, fibrosarcoma, salivary gland hemangioendothelioma, mammary sarcoma, pheochromocytoma) and benign tumors. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in mice (1.15 mg/kg, 3.68 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in rats (0.7 mg/kg, 4.9 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 6-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Mutagenesis Thiotepa was mutagenic in in vitro assays in Salmonella typhimurium, E coli , Chinese hamster lung and human lymphocytes. Chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges were observed in vitro with thiotepa in bean root tips, human lymphocytes, Chinese hamster lung, and monkey lymphocytes. Mutations were observed with oral thiotepa in mouse at doses > 2.5 mg/kg (8 mg/m 2 ). The mouse micronucleus test was positive with IP administration of > 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ). Other positive in vivo chromosomal aberration or mutation assays included Drosophila melanogaster, Chinese hamster marrow, murine marrow, monkey lymphocyte, and murine germ cell. Impairment of Fertility Thiotepa impaired fertility in male mice at PO or IP doses \u2265 0.7 mg/kg (2.24 mg/m 2 ), approximately 12-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa (0.5 mg) inhibited implantation in female rats when instilled into the uterine cavity. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in mice at IP doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg (1.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 17-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in hamsters at an IP dose of 1 mg/kg (4.1 mg/m 2 ), approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Pregnancy Category D: See WARNINGS section. Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Patients of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If thiotepa is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs during thiotepa therapy, the patient and partner should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether thiotepa is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for thiotepa in animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of thiotepa did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreasing hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Hypersensitivity Reactions: Allergic reactions - rash, urticaria, laryngeal edema, asthma, anaphylactic shock, wheezing. Local Reactions: Contact dermatitis, pain at the injection site. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia. Renal: Dysuria, urinary retention. There have been rare reports of chemical cystitis or hemorrhagic cystitis following intravesical, but not parenteral administration of thiotepa. Respiratory: Prolonged apnea has been reported when succinylcholine was administered prior to surgery, following combined use of thiotepa and other anticancer agents. It was theorized that this was caused by decrease of pseudocholinesterase activity caused by the anticancer drugs. Neurologic: Dizziness, headache, blurred vision. Skin: Dermatitis, alopecia.

Dosages within and minimally above the recommended therapeutic doses have been associated with potentially life-threatening hematopoietic toxicity. Thiotepa has a toxic effect on the hematopoietic system that is dose related. Thiotepa is dialyzable. There is no known antidote for overdosage with thiotepa. Transfusions of whole blood or platelets have proven beneficial to the patient in combating hematopoietic toxicity."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Since absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is variable, thiotepa should not be administered orally. Dosage must be carefully individualized. A slow response to thiotepa does not necessarily indicate a lack of effect. Therefore, increasing the frequency of dosing may only increase toxicity. After maximum benefit is obtained by initial therapy, it is necessary to continue the patient on maintenance therapy (1 to 4 week intervals). In order to continue optimal effect, maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly in order to preserve correlation between dose and blood counts. Preparation and Administration Precautions: Thiotepa is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be exercised in handling and preparation of thiotepa. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may occur. The use of gloves is recommended. If thiotepa solution contacts the skin, immediately wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water. If thiotepa contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed thoroughly with water. Preparation of Solution: Thiotepa for injection should be reconstituted with 1.5 m L of sterile water for injection resulting in a drug concentration of approximately 10 mg/mL . The actual withdrawable quantities and concentration achieved are illustrated in the following table: Label Claim (mg/vial) Actual Content (mg/vial) Amount of Diluent to be Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Amount (mg/vial) Approximate Reconstituted Concentration (mg/mL) 15 15.6 1.5 1.4 14.7 10.4 The reconstituted solution is hypotonic and should be further diluted with sodium chloride injection (0. 9% sodium chloride) before use. When reconstituted with sterile water for injection, solutions of thiotepa should be stored in a refrigerator and used within 8 hours. Reconstituted solutions further diluted with sodium chloride injection should be used immediately. In order to eliminate haze, filter solutions through a 0.22 micron filter* prior to administration. Filtering does not alter solution potency. Reconstituted solutions should be clear. Solutions that remain opaque or precipitate after filtration should not be used. *Polysulfone membrane (Gelman\u2019s Sterile AerodiscR, Single Use) or triton-free mixed ester of cellulose/PVC (Millipore\u2019s MILLEXR-GS Filter Unit). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Initial and Maintenance Doses: Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Intravenous Administration: Thiotepa may be given by rapid intravenous administration in doses of 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Intracavitary Administration: The dosage recommended is 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg. Administration is usually effected through the same tubing which is used to remove the fluid from the cavity involved. Intravesical Administration: Patients with papillary carcinoma of the bladder are dehydrated for 8 to 12 hours prior to treatment. Then 60 mg of thiotepa in 30 to 60 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection is instilled into the bladder by catheter. For maximum effect, the solution should be retained for 2 hours. If the patient finds it impossible to retain 60 mL for 2 hours, the dose may be given in a volume of 30 mL. If desired, the patient may be positioned every 15 minutes for maximum area contact. The usual course of treatment is once a week for 4 weeks. The course may be repeated if necessary, but second and third courses must be given with caution since bone-marrow depression may be increased. Deaths have occurred after intravesical administration, caused by bone-marrow depression from systemically absorbed drug. Handling and Disposal: Follow safe cytotoxic agent handling procedures. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. 1-6 There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Thiotepa is a cytotoxic agent of the polyfunctional type, related chemically and pharmacologically to nitrogen mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethylenimine radicals which, like irradiation, disrupt the bonds of DNA. One of the principal bond disruptions is initiated by alkylation of guanine at the N-7 position, which severs the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberates alkylated guanines. The pharmacokinetics of thiotepa and TEPA in thirteen female patients (45 to 84 years) with advanced stage ovarian cancer receiving 60 mg and 80 mg thiotepa by intravenous infusion on subsequent courses given at 4 week intervals are presented in the following table: Pharmacokinetic Parameters (units) Mean \u00b1 SEM Thiotepa TEPA 60 mg 80 mg 60 mg 80 mg Peak Serum concentration (ng/mL) 1331 \u00b1 119 1828 \u00b1 135 273 \u00b1 46 353 \u00b1 46 Elimination half-life (h) 2.4 \u00b1 0.3 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 17.6 \u00b1 3.6 15.7 \u00b1 2.7 Area under the curve (ng/h/mL) 2832 \u00b1 412 4127 \u00b1 668 4789 \u00b1 1022 7452 \u00b1 1667 Total body clearance (mL/min) 446 \u00b1 63 419 \u00b1 56 TEPA, which possesses cytotoxic activity, appears to be the major metabolite of thiotepa found in human serum and urine. Urinary excretion of 14 C-labeled thiotepa and metabolites in a 34 year old patient with metastatic carcinoma of the cecum who received a dose of 0.3 mg/kg intravenously was 63%. Thiotepa and TEPA in urine each accounts for less than 2% of the administered dose. The pharmacokinetics of thiotepa in renal and hepatic dysfunction patients have not been evaluated. Possible pharmacokinetic interactions of thiotepa with any concomitantly administered medications have not been formally investigated."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Thiotepa for Injection has been tried with varying results in the palliation of a wide variety of neoplastic diseases. However, the most consistent results have been seen in the following tumors: Adenocarcinoma of the breast. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. For controlling intracavitary effusions secondary to diffuse or localized neoplastic diseases of various serosal cavities. For the treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder. While now largely superseded by other treatments, Thiotepa for Injection has been effective against other lymphomas, such as lymphosarcoma and Hodgkin's disease."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Thiotepa is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to this preparation. Therapy is probably contraindicated in cases of existing hepatic, renal, or bone-marrow damage. However, if the need outweighs the risk in such patients, thiotepa may be used in low dosage, and accompanied by hepatic, renal and hemopoietic function tests."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Death has occurred after intravesical administration, caused by bone-marrow depression from systematically absorbed drug. Death from septicemia and hemorrhage has occurred as a direct result of hematopoietic depression by thiotepa. Thiotepa is highly toxic to the hematopoietic system. A rapidly falling white blood cell or platelet count indicates the necessity for discontinuing or reducing the dosage of thiotepa. Weekly blood and platelet counts are recommended during therapy and for at least 3 weeks after therapy has been discontinued. Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal (IP) route was teratogenic in mice at doses \u22651 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (0.8 mg/kg, 27 mg/m 2 ), based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses \u22653 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Effective contraception should be used during thiotepa therapy if either the patient or partner is of childbearing potential. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If thiotepa is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs during thiotepa therapy, the patient and partner should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Thiotepa is a polyfunctional alkylating agent, capable of cross-linking the DNA within a cell and changing its nature. The replication of the cell is, therefore, altered, and thiotepa may be described as mutagenic. An in vitro study has shown that it causes chromosomal aberrations of the chromatid type and that the frequency of induced aberrations increases with the age of the subject. Like many alkylating agents, thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals. Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice, but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man. In patients treated with thiotepa, cases of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia have been reported."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The serious complication of excessive thiotepa therapy, or sensitivity to the effects of thiotepa, is bone-marrow depression. If proper precautions are not observed thiotepa may cause leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Information for Patients The patient should notify the physician in the case of any sign of bleeding (epistaxis, easy bruising, change in color of urine, black stool) or infection (fever, chills) or for possible pregnancy to patient or partner. Effective contraception should be used during thiotepa therapy if either the patient or the partner is of childbearing potential. Laboratory Tests The most reliable guide to thiotepa toxicity is the white blood cell count. If this falls to 3,000 or less, the dose should be discontinued. Another good index of thiotepa toxicity is the platelet count; if this falls to 150,000, therapy should be discontinued. Red blood cell count is a less accurate indicator of thiotepa toxicity. If the drug is used in patients with hepatic or renal damage (see CONTRAINDICATIONS section), regular assessment of hepatic and renal function tests are indicated. Drug Interactions It is not advisable to combine, simultaneously or sequentially, cancer chemotherapeutic agents or a cancer chemotherapeutic agent and a therapeutic modality having the same mechanism of action. Therefore, thiotepa combined with other alkylating agents such as nitrogen mustard or cyclophosphamide or thiotepa combined with irradiation would serve to intensify toxicity rather than to enhance therapeutic response. If these agents must follow each other, it is important that recovery from the first agent, as indicated by white blood cell count, be complete before therapy with the second agent is instituted. Other drugs which are known to produce bone-marrow depression should be avoided. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Also see WARNINGS section. Carcinogenesis In mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (1.15 or 2.3 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 43 weeks, respectively) produced a significant increase in the combined incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin, preputial gland, and ear canal, and combined incidence of lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia. In other studies in mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (4 or 8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 20 week observation period or 1.8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 35 week observation period) resulted in an increased incidence of lung tumors. In rats, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (0.7 or 1.4 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 34 weeks, respectively) produced significant increases in the incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin or ear canal, combined hematopoietic neoplasms, and uterine adenocarcinomas. Thiotepa given intravenously (IV) to rats (1 mg/kg once per week for 52 weeks) produced an increased incidence of malignant tumors (abdominal cavity sarcoma, lymphosarcoma myelosis, seminoma, fibrosarcoma, salivary gland hemangioendothelioma, mammary sarcoma, pheochromocytoma) and benign tumors. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in mice (1.15 mg/kg, 3.68 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in rats (0.7 mg/kg, 4.9 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 6-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Mutagenesis Thiotepa was mutagenic in in vitro assays in Salmonella typhimurium, E coli, Chinese hamster lung and human lymphocytes. Chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges were observed in vitro with thiotepa in bean root tips, human lymphocytes, Chinese hamster lung, and monkey lymphocytes. Mutations were observed with oral thiotepa in mouse at doses >2.5 mg/kg (8 mg/m 2 ). The mouse micronucleus test was positive with IP administration of >1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ). Other positive in vivo chromosomal aberration or mutation assays included Drosophila melanogaster, Chinese hamster marrow, murine marrow, monkey lymphocyte, and murine germ cell. Impairment of Fertility Thiotepa impaired fertility in male mice at PO or IP doses \u22650.7 mg/kg (2.24 mg/m 2 ), approximately 12-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa (0.5 mg) inhibited implantation in female rats when instilled into the uterine cavity. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in mice at IP doses \u22650.5 mg/kg (1.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 17-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in hamsters at an IP dose of 1 mg/kg (4.1 mg/m 2 ), approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects - Category D See WARNINGS section. Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in mice at doses \u22651 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses \u22653 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/ m 2 ), approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Patients of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If thiotepa is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs during thiotepa therapy, the patient and partner should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether thiotepa is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for thiotepa in animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of thiotepa did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreasing hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Transfusions of whole blood or platelets have proven beneficial to the patient in combating hematopoietic toxicity."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Since absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is variable, thiotepa for injection should not be administered orally. Dosage must be carefully individualized. A slow response to thiotepa for injection does not necessarily indicate a lack of effect. Therefore, increasing the frequency of dosing may only increase toxicity. After maximum benefit is obtained by initial therapy, it is necessary to continue the patient on maintenance therapy (1 to 4 week intervals). In order to continue optimal effect, maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly in order to preserve correlation between dose and blood counts. Preparation and Administration Precautions Thiotepa for injection is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be exercised in handling and preparation of thiotepa for injection. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa for injection may occur. The use of gloves is recommended. If thiotepa solution contacts the skin, immediately wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water. If thiotepa for injection contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed thoroughly with water. Preparation of Solution Thiotepa for injection should be reconstituted with 1.5 mL of sterile water for injection resulting in a drug concentration of approximately 10 mg per mL . The actual withdrawable quantities and concentration achieved are illustrated in the following table: Label Claim (mg per vial) Actual Content (mg per vial) Amount of Diluent to be Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Amount (mg per vial) Approximate Reconstituted Concentration (mg per mL) 15 15.6 1.5 1.4 14.7 10.4 The reconstituted solution is hypotonic and should be further diluted with sodium chloride injection (0. 9% sodium chloride) before use. When reconstituted with sterile water for injection, solutions of thiotepa should be stored in a refrigerator and used within 8 hours. Reconstituted solutions further diluted with sodium chloride injection should be used immediately. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. In order to eliminate haze, filter solutions through a 0.22 micron filter * prior to administration. Filtering does not alter solution potency. Reconstituted solutions should be clear. Solutions that remain opaque or precipitate after filtration should not be used. * Polysulfone membrane (Gelman's Sterile Aerodisc \u00ae , Single Use) or triton-free mixed ester of cellulose/PVC (Millipore's MILLEX \u00ae -GS Filter Unit). Initial and Maintenance Doses Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Intravenous Administration Thiotepa for injection may be given by rapid intravenous administration in doses of 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Intracavitary Administration The dosage recommended is 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg. Administration is usually effected through the same tubing which is used to remove the fluid from the cavity involved. Intravesical Administration Patients with papillary carcinoma of the bladder are dehydrated for 8 to 12 hours prior to treatment. Then 60 mg of thiotepa for injection in 30 to 60 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection is instilled into the bladder by catheter. For maximum effect, the solution should be retained for 2 hours. If the patient finds it impossible to retain 60 mL for 2 hours, the dose may be given in a volume of 30 mL. If desired, the patient may be positioned every 15 minutes for maximum area contact. The usual course of treatment is once a week for 4 weeks. The course may be repeated if necessary, but second and third courses must be given with caution since bone-marrow depression may be increased. Deaths have occurred after intravesical administration, caused by bone-marrow depression from systemically absorbed drug. Handling and Disposal Follow safe cytotoxic agent handling procedures. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. 1-7 There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast or ovary is 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg intravenously. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of malignant effusions is 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg intracavitary. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder is 60 mg in 30 to 60 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection into the bladder by catheter. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Adenocarcinoma of the Breast or Ovary The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast or ovary is 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg intravenously. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly. Malignant Effusions The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of malignant effusions is 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg intracavitary. Administration is usually effected through the same tubing which is used to remove the fluid from the cavity involved. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly. Superficial Papillary Carcinoma of the Urinary Bladder The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder is 60 mg in 30 to 60 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection into the bladder by catheter. The solution should be retained for 2 hours. If the patient finds it impossible to retain 60 mL for 2 hours, the dose may be given in a volume of 30 mL. The patient may be repositioned every 15 minutes for maximum area contact. The usual course of treatment is once a week for 4 weeks. The course may be repeated if necessary, but second and third courses must be given with caution since bone-marrow depression may be increased. Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA' s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA's marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.2 Preparation Instructions Thiotepa for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures 1 . Reconstitution Reconstitute thiotepa for injection 100 mg with 10 ml of sterile water for injection. Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 10 ml of sterile water for injection. Inject the content of the syringe into the vial through the rubber stopper. Remove the syringe and needle, and mix manually by repeated inversions. The reconstituted solution is hypotonic and must be diluted in saline prior to administration. Reconstituted solutions, free of visible particulate matter, may occasionally show opalescence; such solutions can still be used for further dilution. If not used immediately after reconstitution, the product is stable for 8 hours when stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). Dilution in the infusion bag Prior to administration, dilute the reconstituted solution further with an appropriate volume of sodium chloride 0.9% solution for injection to obtain a final thiotepa for injection concentration between 0.5 and 1 mg/mL. Dilute thiotepa for injection as recommended in Table 2. Table 2: Dilution of Thiotepa for Injection in the infusion bag Calculated Thiotepa for Injection Dose Dilution Volume (Sodium Chloride 0.9% solution for injection) Less than 250 mg Appropriate volume to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL 250 mg to 500 mg 500 mL or appropriate volume to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL Greater than 500 mg 1000 mL or appropriate volume to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL After dilution the product is stable for 24 hours when stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) and for 4 hours when stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. Inspect the diluted solution visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Use thiotepa for injection diluted solutions only if free of visible particulate matter. Filter using a 0.2 micron filter prior to administration. Filtering does not alter solution potency"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Cutaneous toxicity: Cleanse skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after the last dose of thiotepa. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression The consequence of treatment with high doses of thiotepa together with other chemotherapy is profound myelosuppression occurring in all patients. Monitor complete blood counts, and provide supportive care for infections, anemia and thrombocytopenia until there is adequate hematopoietic recovery. For patients receiving thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder, if the bone marrow has been compromised by prior irradiation or chemotherapy, or is recovering from chemotherapy, the risk of severe myelosuppression with thiotepa may be increased. Perform periodic complete blood counts during the course of treatment with thiotepa. Provide supportive care for infections, bleeding, and symptomatic anemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA' s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA's marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred following administration of thiotepa. If anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, discontinue treatment with thiotepa, initiate appropriate therapy, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.3 Cutaneous Toxicity Thiotepa and/or its active metabolites may be excreted in part via skin patients receiving high-dose therapy. Treatment with thiotepa may cause skin discoloration, pruritus, blistering, desquamation, and peeling that may be more severe in the groin, axillae, skin folds, in the neck area, and under dressings. Instruct patients to shower or bathe with water at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of thiotepa. Change occlusive dressing and clean the covered skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of thiotepa. Change bed sheets daily during treatment. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may also occur. Wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water in case thiotepa solution contacts the skin. Flush mucous membranes in case of thiotepa contact with mucous membranes. 5.4 Concomitant Use of Live and Attenuated Vaccines Do not administer live or attenuated viral or bacterial vaccines to a patient treated with thiotepa until the immunosuppressive effects have resolved. 5.5 Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease Hepatic veno-occlusive disease may occur in patients who have received high-dose thiotepa in conjunction with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Monitor by physical examination, serum transaminases and bilirubin and provide supportive care to patients who develop hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA' s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA's marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.6 Central Nervous System Toxicity Fatal encephalopathy has occurred in patients treated with high doses of thiotepa. Other central nervous system toxicities, such as headache, apathy, psychomotor retardation, disorientation, confusion, amnesia, hallucinations, drowsiness, somnolence, seizures, coma, inappropriate behaviour and forgetfulness have been reported to occur in a dose-dependent manner during or shortly after administration of high-dose thiotepa. Do not exceed the recommended dose of thiotepa. If severe or life-threatening central nervous system toxicity occurs, discontinue administration of thiotepa and provide supportive care. Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA' s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA's marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.7 Carcinogenicity Like many alkylating agents, thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals [see Nonclinical Toxicity (13.1) ] . Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice, but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man. There is an increased risk of a secondary malignancy with use of thiotepa. 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of thiotepa in pregnant women. Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal (IP) route was teratogenic in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (0.8 mg/kg, 27 mg/m 2 ), based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during and after treatment with thiotepa for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with thiotepa for at least 1 year after therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3 )]."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effect of Cytochrome CYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers In vitro studies suggest that thiotepa is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 to its active metabolite TEPA. Avoid coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir) and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin) with thiotepa due to the potential effects on efficacy and toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider alternative medications with no or minimal potential to inhibit or induce CYP3A4. If concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 modulators cannot be avoided, closely monitor for adverse drug reactions. 7.2 Effect of Thiotepa on Cytochrome CYP2B6 Substrates In vitro studies suggest that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6. Thiotepa may increase the exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP2B6 in patients; however, the clinical relevance of this in vitro interaction is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . The administration of thiotepa with cyclophosphamide in patients reduces the conversion of cyclophosphamide to the active metabolite, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide; the effect appears sequence dependent with a greater reduction in the conversion to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide when thiotepa is administered 1.5 hours prior to the intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide compared to administration of thiotepa after intravenous cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . The reduction in 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide levels may potentially reduce efficacy of cyclophosphamide treatment."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended. ( 8.2 ) \u2022 Moderate or severe renal impairment: Monitor patients more frequently for toxicity. ( 8.6 , 12.2 ) \u2022 Moderate or severe hepatic impairment: Monitor patients more frequently for toxicity.

However, due to Adienne SA's marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on findings from animals and the drug\u2019s mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Limited available data with thiotepa use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, administration of thiotepa to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis produced teratogenic effects (neural tube defects and malformations of the skeletal system of the fetus) at doses approximately 0.125 and 1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area [see Data]. Consider the benefits and risks of thiotepa for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing thiotepa to a pregnant woman. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Thiotepa given by the IP route in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area, and in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area, resulted in various malformations including neural tube defects, omphalocele, renal agenesis, atresia ani, limb and digit defects, cleft palate, micrognathia, other skeletal anomalies in the skull, vertebrae and ribs, and reduced skeletal ossification. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of thiotepa in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including the potential for tumorigenicity shown for thiotepa in animal studies, advise patients not to breastfeed during thiotepa treatment. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy testing Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating thiotepa therapy. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during thiotepa treatment and for at least 6 months after the final dose of thiotepa. Advise females to immediately report pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Males Thiotepa may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue, resulting in possible genetic abnormalities. Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during thiotepa treatment and for at least 1 year after the final dose of thiotepa [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Infertility Based on nonclinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with thiotepa. Inform male patients about the possibility of sperm conservation before the start of therapy [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of thiotepa in neonates have not been established. Safety and effectiveness of thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA' s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA's marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreasing hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with moderate (creatinine clearance (CLcr) of 30 mL/min to 59 mL/min) renal impairment, decreased renal excretion may result in increased plasma levels of thiotepa and TEPA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . This may result in increased toxicity. Monitor patients with moderate to severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment for signs and symptoms of toxicity following treatment with thiotepa for an extended period of time. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Thiotepa is extensively metabolized in the liver. Patients with moderate (bilirubin levels greater than 1.5 times to 3 times the upper limit of normal and any AST) hepatic impairment may have increased plasma levels of thiotepa [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. This may result in toxicity. Monitor patients with moderate to severe (bilirubin levels greater than 3 times upper limit of normal and any AST) hepatic impairment for signs and symptoms of toxicity following treatment with thiotepa for an extended period of time."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on findings from animals and the drug\u2019s mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Limited available data with thiotepa use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, administration of thiotepa to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis produced teratogenic effects (neural tube defects and malformations of the skeletal system of the fetus) at doses approximately 0.125 and 1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area [see Data]. Consider the benefits and risks of thiotepa for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing thiotepa to a pregnant woman. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Thiotepa given by the IP route in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area, and in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area, resulted in various malformations including neural tube defects, omphalocele, renal agenesis, atresia ani, limb and digit defects, cleft palate, micrognathia, other skeletal anomalies in the skull, vertebrae and ribs, and reduced skeletal ossification. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thiotepa is a cytotoxic agent of the polyfunctional type, related chemically and pharmacologically to the nitrogen mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethyleneimine radicals which, like irradiation, disrupt the bonds of DNA. One of the principle bond disruptions is initiated by alkylation of guanine at the N-7 position, which severs the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberates alkylated guanines. 12.2 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Thiotepa reached maximal concentrations close to the end infusion following an intravenous infusion. Distribution The binding of thiotepa to plasma proteins is approximately 10% to 20%. In adults administered intravenous thiotepa between 20 mg to 250 mg/m 2 as an intravenous bolus or infusion up to 4 hours, the mean volume of distribution of thiotepa ranged from 1.0 L/kg (30%) to 1.9 L/kg (17%). Elimination In adults administered intravenous thiotepa between 20 mg to 250 mg/m 2 as an intravenous bolus or infusion up to 4 hours, the mean thiotepa clearance ranged from 14.6 L/hr/m 2 (23%) to 27.9 L/hr/m 2 (69%). In adult population, the mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 1.4 hours (7%) to 3.7 hours (14%) for thiotepa and from 4.9 hours to 17.6 hours (20%) for TEPA. Metabolism Thiotepa undergoes hepatic metabolism. In vitro data suggests that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 may be responsible for the metabolism of thiotepa to TEPA, a major active metabolite. Excretion In adult patients, urinary excretion of thiotepa accounted for less than 2% of the dose and TEPA accounted for 11% or less of the dose. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment The exposure (as measured by area under the curve (AUC)) of thiotepa increased by 1.6-fold and 1.8-fold following administration of multiple thiotepa doses of 7 mg/kg administered every 2 days with cyclophosphamide in two adult patients who had liver metastases with moderate hepatic impairment compared to the exposure observed in one patient with normal hepatic function . The effect of severe hepatic impairment on thiotepa exposure is unknown. Renal Impairment The exposure (as measured by AUC) of thiotepa increased by 1.4-fold and TEPA increased by 2.6-fold following administration of multiple doses of 120 mg/m 2 /day in one patient with moderate renal impairment (CLcr = 38 mL/min) administered cyclophosphamide plus thiotepa plus carboplatin, compared to exposure of thiotepa in patients with normal renal function. The effects of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease on thiotepa exposure are unknown. Drug Interactions The clinical relevance of in vitro inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzymes described below is unknown, but it cannot be excluded that the systemic exposure of thiotepa or medicinal products that are substrates for these enzymes may be affected with concomitant administration with thiotepa. Effect of Cytochrome P450 Modulators on Thiotepa In vitro data demonstrates that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inhibitors decrease the metabolism of thiotepa [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Effect of Thiotepa on Cytochrome P450 2B6 In vitro data demonstrates that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6. Effect of Thiotepa on Cyclophosphamide The administration of thiotepa 1.5 hours prior to intravenous cyclophosphamide in patients administered cyclophosphamide plus thiotepa plus carboplatin decreased the AUC of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide by 26% and maximal concentrations of 4hydroxycyclophosphamide by 62%, compared to administration of cyclophosphamide prior to thiotepa.

In other studies in mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (4 or 8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 20 week observation period or 1.8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 35 week observation period) resulted in an increased incidence of lung tumors. In rats, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (0.7 or 1.4 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 34 weeks, respectively) produced significant increases in the incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin or ear canal, combined hematopoietic neoplasms, and uterine adenocarcinomas. Thiotepa given intravenously (IV) to rats (1 mg/kg once per week for 52 weeks) produced an increased incidence of malignant tumors (abdominal cavity sarcoma, lymphosarcoma myelosis, seminoma, fibrosarcoma, salivary gland hemangioendothelioma, mammary sarcoma, pheochromocytoma) and benign tumors. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in mice (1.15 mg/kg, 3.68 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in rats (0.7 mg/kg, 4.9 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 6-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was mutagenic in in vitro assays in Salmonella typhimurium, E coli , Chinese hamster lung and human lymphocytes. Chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges were observed in vitro with thiotepa in bean root tips, human lymphocytes, Chinese hamster lung, and monkey lymphocytes. Mutations were observed with oral thiotepa in mouse at doses > 2.5 mg/kg (8 mg/m 2 ). The mouse micronucleus test was positive with intraperitoneal administration of > 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ). Other positive in vivo chromosomal aberration or mutation assays included Drosophila melanogaster , Chinese hamster marrow, murine marrow, monkey lymphocyte, and murine germ cell. Thiotepa impaired fertility in male mice at oral or intraperitoneal doses \u2265 0.7 mg/kg (2.24 mg/m 2 ), approximately 12-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa (0.5 mg) inhibited implantation in female rats when instilled into the uterine cavity. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in mice at IP doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg (1.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 17-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area.

( 2.1 ) The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder is 60 mg in 30 to 60 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection into the bladder by catheter. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Adenocarcinoma of the Breast or Ovary The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast or ovary is 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg intravenously. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly. Malignant Effusions The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of malignant effusions is 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg intracavitary. Administration is usually effected through the same tubing which is used to remove the fluid from the cavity involved. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly. Superficial Papillary Carcinoma of the Urinary Bladder The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder is 60 mg in 30 to 60 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection into the bladder by catheter. The solution should be retained for 2 hours. If the patient finds it impossible to retain 60 mL for 2 hours, the dose may be given in a volume of 30 mL. The patient may be repositioned every 15 minutes for maximum area contact. The usual course of treatment is once a week for 4 weeks. The course may be repeated if necessary, but second and third courses must be given with caution since bone-marrow depression may be increased.

Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures 1 . Reconstitution Reconstitute thiotepa for injection 15 mg with 1.5 mL of sterile water for injection. Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 1.5 mL of sterile water for injection. Inject the content of the syringe into the vial through the rubber stopper. Remove the syringe and needle, and mix manually by repeated inversions. Reconstitute thiotepa for injection 100 mg with 10 mL of sterile water for injection. Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 10 mL of sterile water for injection. Inject the content of the syringe into the vial through the rubber stopper. Remove the syringe and needle, and mix manually by repeated inversions. The reconstituted solution is hypotonic and must be diluted in saline prior to administration. Reconstituted solutions, free of visible particulate matter, may occasionally show opalescence; such solutions can still be used for further dilution. If not used immediately after reconstitution, the product is stable for 8 hours when stored at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). Dilution in the Infusion Bag Prior to administration, dilute the reconstituted solution further with an appropriate volume of sodium chloride 0.9% solution for injection to obtain a final thiotepa for injection concentration between 0.5 and 1 mg per mL. Dilute thiotepa for injection as recommended in Table 2 .

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cutaneous toxicity: Cleanse skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after the last dose of thiotepa. ( 5.3 ) Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression The consequence of treatment with high doses of thiotepa together with other chemotherapy is profound myelosuppression occurring in all patients. Monitor complete blood counts, and provide supportive care for infections, anemia and thrombocytopenia until there is adequate hematopoietic recovery. For patients receiving thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder, if the bone marrow has been compromised by prior irradiation or chemotherapy, or is recovering from chemotherapy, the risk of severe myelosuppression with thiotepa may be increased. Perform periodic complete blood counts during the course of treatment with thiotepa. Provide supportive care for infections, bleeding, and symptomatic anemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA\u2019s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for injection. However, due to Adienne SA\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred following administration of thiotepa. If anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, discontinue treatment with thiotepa, initiate appropriate therapy, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.3 Cutaneous Toxicity Thiotepa and/or its active metabolites may be excreted in part via skin patients receiving high-dose therapy. Treatment with thiotepa may cause skin discoloration, pruritus, blistering, desquamation, and peeling that may be more severe in the groin, axillae, skin folds, in the neck area, and under dressings. Instruct patients to shower or bathe with water at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of thiotepa. Change occlusive dressing and clean the covered skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of thiotepa. Change bed sheets daily during treatment. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may also occur. Wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water in case thiotepa solution contacts the skin. Flush mucous membranes in case of thiotepa contact with mucous membranes. 5.4 Concomitant Use of Live and Attenuated Vaccines Do not administer live or attenuated viral or bacterial vaccines to a patient treated with thiotepa until the immunosuppressive effects have resolved. 5.5 Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease Hepatic veno-occlusive disease may occur in patients who have received high-dose thiotepa in conjunction with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Monitor by physical examination, serum transaminases and bilirubin and provide supportive care to patients who develop hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA\u2019s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for injection. However, due to Adienne SA\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.6 Central Nervous System Toxicity Fatal encephalopathy has occurred in patients treated with high doses of thiotepa. Other central nervous system toxicities, such as headache, apathy, psychomotor retardation, disorientation, confusion, amnesia, hallucinations, drowsiness, somnolence, seizures, coma, inappropriate behaviour and forgetfulness have been reported to occur in a dose-dependent manner during or shortly after administration of high-dose thiotepa. Do not exceed the recommended dose of thiotepa. If severe or life-threatening central nervous system toxicity occurs, discontinue administration of thiotepa and provide supportive care.

However, due to Adienne SA\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.7 Carcinogenicity Like many alkylating agents, thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals [see Nonclinical Toxicity (13.1) ] . Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice, but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man. There is an increased risk of a secondary malignancy with use of thiotepa. 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of thiotepa in pregnant women. Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal (IP) route was teratogenic in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (0.8 mg/kg, 27 mg/m 2 ), based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during and after treatment with thiotepa for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with thiotepa for at least 1 year after therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effect of Cytochrome CYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers In vitro studies suggest that thiotepa is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 to its active metabolite TEPA. Avoid coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir) and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin) with thiotepa due to the potential effects on efficacy and toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider alternative medications with no or minimal potential to inhibit or induce CYP3A4. If concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 modulators cannot be avoided, closely monitor for adverse drug reactions. 7.2 Effect of Thiotepa on Cytochrome CYP2B6 Substrates In vitro studies suggest that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6. Thiotepa may increase the exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP2B6 in patients; however, the clinical relevance of this in vitro interaction is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . The administration of thiotepa with cyclophosphamide in patients reduces the conversion of cyclophosphamide to the active metabolite, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide; the effect appears sequence dependent with a greater reduction in the conversion to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide when thiotepa is administered 1.5 hours prior to the intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide compared to administration of thiotepa after intravenous cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . The reduction in 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide levels may potentially reduce efficacy of cyclophosphamide treatment."

Limited available data with thiotepa use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, administration of thiotepa to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis produced teratogenic effects (neural tube defects and malformations of the skeletal system of the fetus) at doses approximately 0.125 and 1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of thiotepa for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing thiotepa to a pregnant woman. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Thiotepa given by the IP route in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area, and in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area, resulted in various malformations including neural tube defects, omphalocele, renal agenesis, atresia ani, limb and digit defects, cleft palate, micrognathia, other skeletal anomalies in the skull, vertebrae and ribs, and reduced skeletal ossification. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of thiotepa in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including the potential for tumorigenicity shown for thiotepa in animal studies, advise patients not to breastfeed during thiotepa treatment. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating thiotepa therapy. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during thiotepa treatment and for at least 6 months after the final dose of thiotepa. Advise females to immediately report pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Males Thiotepa may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue, resulting in possible genetic abnormalities. Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during thiotepa treatment and for at least 1 year after the final dose of thiotepa [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Based on nonclinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with thiotepa. Inform male patients about the possibility of sperm conservation before the start of therapy [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of thiotepa in neonates have not been established.

However, due to Adienne SA\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreasing hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with moderate (creatinine clearance (CLcr) of 30 mL/min to 59 mL/min) renal impairment, decreased renal excretion may result in increased plasma levels of thiotepa and TEPA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . This may result in increased toxicity. Monitor patients with moderate to severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment for signs and symptoms of toxicity following treatment with thiotepa for an extended period of time. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Thiotepa is extensively metabolized in the liver. Patients with moderate (bilirubin levels greater than 1.5 times to 3 times the upper limit of normal and any AST) hepatic impairment may have increased plasma levels of thiotepa [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . This may result in toxicity.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thiotepa is a cytotoxic agent of the polyfunctional type, related chemically and pharmacologically to the nitrogen mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethyleneimine radicals which, like irradiation, disrupt the bonds of DNA. One of the principle bond disruptions is initiated by alkylation of guanine at the N-7 position, which severs the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberates alkylated guanines. 12.2 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Thiotepa reached maximal concentrations close to the end infusion following an intravenous infusion. Distribution The binding of thiotepa to plasma proteins is approximately 10% to 20%. In adults administered intravenous thiotepa between 20 mg to 250 mg/m 2 as an intravenous bolus or infusion up to 4 hours, the mean volume of distribution of thiotepa ranged from 1.0 L/kg (30%) to 1.9 L/kg (17%). Elimination In adults administered intravenous thiotepa between 20 mg to 250 mg/m 2 as an intravenous bolus or infusion up to 4 hours, the mean thiotepa clearance ranged from 14.6 L/hr/m 2 (23%) to 27.9 L/hr/m 2 (69%). In adult population, the mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 1.4 hours (7%) to 3.7 hours (14%) for thiotepa and from 4.9 hours to 17.6 hours (20%) for TEPA. Metabolism Thiotepa undergoes hepatic metabolism. In vitro data suggests that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 may be responsible for the metabolism of thiotepa to TEPA, a major active metabolite. Excretion In adult patients, urinary excretion of thiotepa accounted for less than 2% of the dose and TEPA accounted for 11% or less of the dose. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment The exposure (as measured by area under the curve (AUC)) of thiotepa increased by 1.6-fold and 1.8-fold following administration of multiple thiotepa doses of 7 mg/kg administered every 2 days with cyclophosphamide in two adult patients who had liver metastases with moderate hepatic impairment compared to the exposure observed in one patient with normal hepatic function. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on thiotepa exposure is unknown. Renal Impairment The exposure (as measured by AUC) of thiotepa increased by 1.4-fold and TEPA increased by 2.6-fold following administration of multiple doses of 120 mg/m 2 /day in one patient with moderate renal impairment (CLcr = 38 mL/min) administered cyclophosphamide plus thiotepa plus carboplatin, compared to exposure of thiotepa in patients with normal renal function. The effects of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease on thiotepa exposure are unknown. Drug Interactions The clinical relevance of in vitro inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzymes described below is unknown, but it cannot be excluded that the systemic exposure of thiotepa or medicinal products that are substrates for these enzymes may be affected with concomitant administration with thiotepa. Effect of Cytochrome P450 Modulators on Thiotepa In vitro data demonstrates that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inhibitors decrease the metabolism of thiotepa [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Effect of Thiotepa on Cytochrome P450 2B6 In vitro data demonstrates that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6. Effect of Thiotepa on Cyclophosphamide The administration of thiotepa 1.5 hours prior to intravenous cyclophosphamide in patients administered cyclophosphamide plus thiotepa plus carboplatin decreased the AUC of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide by 26% and maximal concentrations of 4\u00ad-hydroxycyclophosphamide by 62%, compared to administration of cyclophosphamide prior to thiotepa.

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Thiotepa is a cytotoxic agent of the polyfunctional type, related chemically and pharmacologically to the nitrogen mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethyleneimine radicals which, like irradiation, disrupt the bonds of DNA. One of the principle bond disruptions is initiated by alkylation of guanine at the N-7 position, which severs the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberates alkylated guanines."

In other studies in mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (4 or 8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 20 week observation period or 1.8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 35 week observation period) resulted in an increased incidence of lung tumors. In rats, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (0.7 or 1.4 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 34 weeks, respectively) produced significant increases in the incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin or ear canal, combined hematopoietic neoplasms, and uterine adenocarcinomas. Thiotepa given intravenously (IV) to rats (1 mg/kg once per week for 52 weeks) produced an increased incidence of malignant tumors (abdominal cavity sarcoma, lymphosarcoma myelosis, seminoma, fibrosarcoma, salivary gland hemangioendothelioma, mammary sarcoma, pheochromocytoma) and benign tumors. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in mice (1.15 mg/kg, 3.68 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in rats (0.7 mg/kg, 4.9 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 6-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was mutagenic in in vitro assays in Salmonella typhimurium, E coli , Chinese hamster lung and human lymphocytes. Chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges were observed in vitro with thiotepa in bean root tips, human lymphocytes, Chinese hamster lung, and monkey lymphocytes. Mutations were observed with oral thiotepa in mouse at doses > 2.5 mg/kg (8 mg/m 2 ). The mouse micronucleus test was positive with intraperitoneal administration of > 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ). Other positive in vivo chromosomal aberration or mutation assays included Drosophila melanogaster , Chinese hamster marrow, murine marrow, monkey lymphocyte, and murine germ cell. Thiotepa impaired fertility in male mice at oral or intraperitoneal doses \u2265 0.7 mg/kg (2.24 mg/m 2 ), approximately 12-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa (0.5 mg) inhibited implantation in female rats when instilled into the uterine cavity. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in mice at IP doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg (1.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 17-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in hamsters at an IP dose of 1 mg/kg (4.1 mg/m 2 ), approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area."

Infuse thiotepa for injection via a central venous catheter over 3 hours using an infusion set equipped with a 0.2 micron in-line filter. Prior to and following each infusion, flush the catheter with approximately 5 mL sodium chloride 0.9% solution for injection. Thiotepa for injection is excreted through the skin of patients receiving high-dose therapy. Take precautions to prevent skin toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Adenocarcinoma of the Breast or Ovary The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast or ovary is 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg intravenously. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly. Malignant Effusions The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of malignant effusions is 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg intracavitary. Administration is usually effected through the same tubing which is used to remove the fluid from the cavity involved. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly. Superficial Papillary Carcinoma of the Urinary Bladder The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder is 60 mg in 30 to 60 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection into the bladder by catheter. The solution should be retained for 2 hours. If the patient finds it impossible to retain 60 mL for 2 hours, the dose may be given in a volume of 30 mL. The patient may be repositioned every 15 minutes for maximum area contact. The usual course of treatment is once a week for 4 weeks. The course may be repeated if necessary, but second and third courses must be given with caution since bone-marrow depression may be increased. 2.2 Preparation Instructions Thiotepa for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures 1 . Reconstitution Reconstitute thiotepa for injection 15 mg with 1.5 mL of sterile water for injection. Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 1.5 mL of sterile water for injection. Inject the content of the syringe into the vial through the rubber stopper. Remove the syringe and needle, and mix manually by repeated inversions. Reconstitute thiotepa for injection 100 mg with 10 mL of sterile water for injection. Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 10 mL of sterile water for injection. Inject the content of the syringe into the vial through the rubber stopper. Remove the syringe and needle, and mix manually by repeated inversions. The reconstituted solution is hypotonic and must be diluted in saline prior to administration. Reconstituted solutions, free of visible particulate matter, may occasionally show opalescence; such solutions can still be used for further dilution. If not used immediately after reconstitution, the product is stable for 8 hours when stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). Dilution in the infusion bag Prior to administration, dilute the reconstituted solution further with an appropriate volume of sodium chloride 0.9% solution for injection to obtain a final thiotepa for injection concentration between 0.5 and 1 mg/mL. Dilute thiotepa for injection as recommended in Table 2. Table 2: Dilution of Thiotepa for Injection in the infusion bag Calculated Thiotepa for Injection Dose Dilution Volume (Sodium Chloride 0.9% solution for injection) Less than 250 mg Appropriate volume to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL 250 mg to 500 mg 500 mL or appropriate volume to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL Greater than 500 mg 1000 mL or appropriate volume to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL After dilution the product is stable for 24 hours when stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) and for 4 hours when stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. Inspect the diluted solution visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Use thiotepa for injection diluted solutions only if free of visible particulate matter. Filter using a 0.2 micron filter prior to administration. Filtering does not alter solution potency"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Cutaneous toxicity: Cleanse skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after the last dose of thiotepa. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression The consequence of treatment with high doses of thiotepa together with other chemotherapy at the recommended dose and schedule in the preparative regimen for class 3 beta-thalassemia is profound myelosuppression occurring in all patients. Do not begin the preparative regimen if a stem cell donor is not available. Monitor complete blood counts, and provide supportive care for infections, anemia and thrombocytopenia until there is adequate hematopoietic recovery. For patients receiving thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder, if the bone marrow has been compromised by prior irradiation or chemotherapy, or is recovering from chemotherapy, the risk of severe myelosuppression with thiotepa may be increased. Perform periodic complete blood counts during the course of treatment with thiotepa. Provide supportive care for infections, bleeding, and symptomatic anemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.2 Hypersensitivity Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred following administration of thiotepa. If anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, discontinue treatment with thiotepa, initiate appropriate therapy, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.3 Cutaneous Toxicity Thiotepa and/or its active metabolites may be excreted in part via skin patients receiving high-dose therapy. Treatment with thiotepa may cause skin discoloration, pruritus, blistering, desquamation, and peeling that may be more severe in the groin, axillae, skin folds, in the neck area, and under dressings. Instruct patients to shower or bathe with water at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of thiotepa. Change occlusive dressing and clean the covered skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of thiotepa. Change bed sheets daily during treatment. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may also occur. Wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water in case thiotepa solution contacts the skin. Flush mucous membranes in case of thiotepa contact with mucous membranes. 5.4 Concomitant Use of Live and Attenuated Vaccines Do not administer live or attenuated viral or bacterial vaccines to a patient treated with thiotepa until the immunosuppressive effects have resolved. 5.5 Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease Hepatic veno-occlusive disease may occur in patients who have received high-dose thiotepa in conjunction with busulfan and cyclophosphamide [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Monitor by physical examination, serum transaminases and bilirubin daily through BMT Day +28, and provide supportive care to patients who develop hepatic veno-occlusive disease. 5.6 Central Nervous System Toxicity Fatal encephalopathy has occurred in patients treated with high doses of thiotepa. Other central nervous system toxicities, such as headache, apathy, psychomotor retardation, disorientation, confusion, amnesia, hallucinations, drowsiness, somnolence, seizures, coma, inappropriate behaviour and forgetfulness have been reported to occur in a dose-dependent manner during or shortly after administration of high-dose thiotepa. In pediatric patients treated with thiotepa at the recommended dose in combination with busulfan and cyclophosphamide, 8% developed central nervous system toxicity (seizures and intracranial hemorrhage). Do not exceed the recommended dose of thiotepa. If severe or life-threatening central nervous system toxicity occurs, discontinue administration of thiotepa and provide supportive care. 5.7 Carcinogenicity Like many alkylating agents, thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals [see Nonclinical Toxicity (13.1) ] . Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice, but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man. There is an increased risk of a secondary malignancy with use of thiotepa. 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of thiotepa in pregnant women. Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal (IP) route was teratogenic in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (0.8 mg/kg, 27 mg/m 2 ), based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during and after treatment with thiotepa for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with thiotepa for at least 1 year after therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3 )]."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gland Pharma Limited at 866-770-7144 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions With the Preparative Regimen for Class 3 Beta-Thalassemia The safety of thiotepa was evaluated by retrospective analysis of 76 pediatric patients with class 3 beta-thalassemia who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation (HSCT) using busulfan and cyclophosphamide with thiotepa (n=25) or without thiotepa (n=51) [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Adverse reactions were abstracted retrospectively from the medical records. Serious adverse events that occurred in the thiotepa-treated and control cohort were, respectively: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (4% vs 2%), pneumonia (4% vs 0), seizure (4% vs 2%), subarachnoid hemorrhage (4% vs 0) and venoocclusive disease (4% vs 2%). By 90 days after HSCT, grades 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease was observed in 7 (28%) patients in the thiotepa cohort and in 13 (26%) patients in the control cohort. By 1-year after transplantation, chronic graft-versus-host disease was observed in 8 (35%) of 23 evaluable patients in the thiotepa cohort, and 7 (14%) of 49 evaluable patients in the control cohort. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with thiotepa from start of the preparative regimen through 30 days after transplantation are shown in Table 3. Table 3: Common Adverse Reactions (>5%) Occurring Through 30 Days After Transplantation In Patients With Class 3 Beta-Thalassemia Using Busulfan And Cyclophosphamide With Or Without Thiotepa in the Preparative Regimen Preparative Regimen of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide With Thiotepa N=25 patients (%) Without Thiotepa N=51 patients (%) Adverse Reaction Any Grade Grade 3-5 1 Any Grade Grade 3-5 1 Mucositis 2 16 (64%) 4 (16%) 22 (43%) 1 (2%) Cytomegalovirus Infection 12 (48%) 0 15 (29%) 0 Hemorrhage 3 7 (28%) 2 (8%) 12 (24%) 3 (6%) Diarrhea 6 (24%) 0 7 (14%) 2 (4%) Hematuria 4 5 (20%) 0 10 (20%) 3 (6%) Rash 5 3 (12%) 0 11 (22%) 0 Intracranial Hemorrhage 6 2 (8%) 1 (4%) 0 0 Pseudomonas Infection 2 (8%) 0 0 0 1 Severe, life-threatening or fatal 2 Mucositis includes mouth hemorrhage, mucosal inflammation and stomatitis 3 Hemorrhage includes all hemorrhage terms 4 Hematuria includes cystitis hemorrhagic and hematuria 5 Rash includes dermatitis exfoliative, palmar erythema, rash, rash maculo-papular, rash pruritic and skin toxicity 6 Hemorrhage Intracranial includes hemorrhage intracranial and subarachnoid hemorrhage All patients in the Thiotepa-treated and control cohorts developed profound cytopenias, including neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia. Table 4 shows the selected chemistry abnormalities that occurred from start of the preparative regimen through 30 days after transplantation.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effect of Cytochrome CYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers In vitro studies suggest that thiotepa is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 to its active metabolite TEPA. Avoid coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir) and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin) with thiotepa due to the potential effects on efficacy and toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider alternative medications with no or minimal potential to inhibit or induce CYP3A4. If concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 modulators cannot be avoided, closely monitor for adverse drug reactions. 7.2 Effect of Thiotepa on Cytochrome CYP2B6 Substrates In vitro studies suggest that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6. Thiotepa may increase the exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP2B6 in patients; however, the clinical relevance of this in vitro interaction is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . The administration of thiotepa with cyclophosphamide in patients reduces the conversion of cyclophosphamide to the active metabolite, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide; the effect appears sequence dependent with a greater reduction in the conversion to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide when thiotepa is administered 1.5 hours prior to the intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide compared to administration of thiotepa after intravenous cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . The reduction in 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide levels may potentially reduce efficacy of cyclophosphamide treatment."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended. ( 8.2 ) \u2022 Moderate or severe renal impairment: Monitor patients more frequently for toxicity. ( 8.6 , 12.2 ) \u2022 Moderate or severe hepatic impairment: Monitor patients more frequently for toxicity. ( 8.7 , 12.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on findings from animals and the drug\u2019s mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Limited available data with thiotepa use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, administration of thiotepa to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis produced teratogenic effects (neural tube defects and malformations of the skeletal system of the fetus) at doses approximately 0.125 and 1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area [see Data]. Consider the benefits and risks of thiotepa for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing thiotepa to a pregnant woman. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Thiotepa given by the IP route in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area, and in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area, resulted in various malformations including neural tube defects, omphalocele, renal agenesis, atresia ani, limb and digit defects, cleft palate, micrognathia, other skeletal anomalies in the skull, vertebrae and ribs, and reduced skeletal ossification. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of thiotepa in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including the potential for tumorigenicity shown for thiotepa in animal studies, advise patients not to breastfeed during thiotepa treatment. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy testing Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating thiotepa therapy. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during thiotepa treatment and for at least 6 months after the final dose of thiotepa. Advise females to immediately report pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Males Thiotepa may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue, resulting in possible genetic abnormalities. Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during thiotepa treatment and for at least 1 year after the final dose of thiotepa [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Infertility Based on nonclinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with thiotepa. Inform male patients about the possibility of sperm conservation before the start of therapy [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of thiotepa for prevention of graft rejection in pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT for class 3 beta-thalassemia was established in one prospective study and one retrospective study [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] that included 1 infant (1 month to 1 year), 23 children (2 to 11 years) and 13 adolescents (12 to 16 years) who received thiotepa as part of their preparative regimen. Safety and effectiveness of thiotepa in neonates have not been established. Safety and effectiveness of thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The safety and effectiveness of thiotepa as a preparative regimen prior to allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation (HSCT) for patients with class 3 beta-thalassemia have not been established in geriatric patients. Clinical studies of thiotepa for this indication did not include subjects aged 65 and over. Clinical studies of thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreasing hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with moderate (creatinine clearance (CLcr) of 30 mL/min to 59 mL/min) renal impairment, decreased renal excretion may result in increased plasma levels of thiotepa and TEPA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . This may result in increased toxicity. Monitor patients with moderate to severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment for signs and symptoms of toxicity following treatment with thiotepa for an extended period of time. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Thiotepa is extensively metabolized in the liver. Patients with moderate (bilirubin levels greater than 1.5 times to 3 times the upper limit of normal and any AST) hepatic impairment may have increased plasma levels of thiotepa [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. This may result in toxicity. Monitor patients with moderate to severe (bilirubin levels greater than 3 times upper limit of normal and any AST) hepatic impairment for signs and symptoms of toxicity following treatment with thiotepa for an extended period of time."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thiotepa is a cytotoxic agent of the polyfunctional type, related chemically and pharmacologically to the nitrogen mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethyleneimine radicals which, like irradiation, disrupt the bonds of DNA. One of the principle bond disruptions is initiated by alkylation of guanine at the N-7 position, which severs the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberates alkylated guanines. 12.2 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Thiotepa reached maximal concentrations close to the end infusion following an intravenous infusion. Distribution The binding of thiotepa to plasma proteins is approximately 10% to 20%. The mean volume of distribution (% coefficient of variation) of thiotepa was 30 L/m 2 (44%) or 1.2 L/kg (47%) following a single intravenous infusion of thiotepa at a dose of 5 mg/kg over 3 hours in pediatric population. In adults administered intravenous thiotepa between 20 mg to 250 mg/m 2 as an intravenous bolus or infusion up to 4 hours, the mean volume of distribution of thiotepa ranged from 1.0 L/kg (30%) to 1.9 L/kg (17%). Elimination Following a single intravenous infusion over 3 hours of thiotepa at a dose of 5 mg/kg in pediatric population, the estimated mean (% coefficient of variation) clearance of thiotepa was 0.58 L/hr/kg (60%) or 13.8 L/hr/m2 (52%). The mean terminal elimination half-life was 1.7 hours (64%) for thiotepa and 4 hours (29%) for its major active metabolite, N,N',N''-triethylenephosphoramide (TEPA) in pediatric population. In adults administered intravenous thiotepa between 20 mg to 250 mg/m 2 as an intravenous bolus or infusion up to 4 hours, the mean thiotepa clearance ranged from 14.6 L/hr/m 2 (23%) to 27.9 L/hr/m 2 (69%). In adult population, the mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 1.4 hours (7%) to 3.7 hours (14%) for thiotepa and from 4.9 hours to 17.6 hours (20%) for TEPA. Metabolism Thiotepa undergoes hepatic metabolism. In vitro data suggests that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 may be responsible for the metabolism of thiotepa to TEPA, a major active metabolite. Excretion In adult and pediatric patients, urinary excretion of thiotepa accounted for less than 2% of the dose and TEPA accounted for 11% or less of the dose. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment The clearance of thiotepa following a single thiotepa dose of 5 mg/kg in pediatric population with mild hepatic impairment was similar to the clearance observed in patients with normal liver function administered thiotepa. The exposure (as measured by area under the curve (AUC)) of thiotepa increased by 1.6-fold and 1.8-fold following administration of multiple thiotepa doses of 7 mg/kg administered every 2 days with cyclophosphamide in two adult patients who had liver metastases with moderate hepatic impairment compared to the exposure observed in one patient with normal hepatic function . The effect of severe hepatic impairment on thiotepa exposure is unknown. Renal Impairment The exposure (as measured by AUC) of thiotepa increased by 1.4-fold and TEPA increased by 2.6-fold following administration of multiple doses of 120 mg/m 2 /day in one patient with moderate renal impairment (CLcr = 38 mL/min) administered cyclophosphamide plus thiotepa plus carboplatin, compared to exposure of thiotepa in patients with normal renal function. The effects of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease on thiotepa exposure are unknown. Drug Interactions The clinical relevance of in vitro inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzymes described below is unknown, but it cannot be excluded that the systemic exposure of thiotepa or medicinal products that are substrates for these enzymes may be affected with concomitant administration with thiotepa. Effect of Cytochrome P450 Modulators on Thiotepa In vitro data demonstrates that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inhibitors decrease the metabolism of thiotepa [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Effect of Thiotepa on Cytochrome P450 2B6 In vitro data demonstrates that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6. Effect of Thiotepa on Cyclophosphamide The administration of thiotepa 1.5 hours prior to intravenous cyclophosphamide in patients administered cyclophosphamide plus thiotepa plus carboplatin decreased the AUC of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide by 26% and maximal concentrations of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide by 62%, compared to administration of cyclophosphamide prior to thiotepa."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In mice, repeated intraperitoneal (IP) administration of thiotepa (1.15 or 2.3 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 43 weeks, respectively) produced a significant increase in the combined incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin, preputial gland, and ear canal, and combined incidence of lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia. In other studies in mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (4 or 8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 20 week observation period or 1.8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 35 week observation period) resulted in an increased incidence of lung tumors. In rats, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (0.7 or 1.4 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 34 weeks, respectively) produced significant increases in the incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin or ear canal, combined hematopoietic neoplasms, and uterine adenocarcinomas. Thiotepa given intravenously (IV) to rats (1 mg/kg once per week for 52 weeks) produced an increased incidence of malignant tumors (abdominal cavity sarcoma, lymphosarcoma myelosis, seminoma, fibrosarcoma, salivary gland hemangioendothelioma, mammary sarcoma, pheochromocytoma) and benign tumors. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in mice (1.15 mg/kg, 3.68 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in rats (0.7 mg/kg, 4.9 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 6-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was mutagenic in in vitro assays in Salmonella typhimurium, E coli , Chinese hamster lung and human lymphocytes. Chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges were observed in vitro with thiotepa in bean root tips, human lymphocytes, Chinese hamster lung, and monkey lymphocytes. Mutations were observed with oral thiotepa in mouse at doses > 2.5 mg/kg (8 mg/m 2 ). The mouse micronucleus test was positive with intraperitoneal administration of > 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ). Other positive in vivo chromosomal aberration or mutation assays included Drosophila melanogaster , Chinese hamster marrow, murine marrow, monkey lymphocyte, and murine germ cell. Thiotepa impaired fertility in male mice at oral or intraperitoneal doses \u2265 0.7 mg/kg (2.24 mg/m 2 ), approximately 12-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa (0.5 mg) inhibited implantation in female rats when instilled into the uterine cavity. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in mice at IP doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg (1.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 17-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in hamsters at an IP dose of 1 mg/kg (4.1 mg/m 2 ), approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Thiotepa was evaluated in a retrospective study of pediatric patients with class 3 beta-thalassemia who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation (HSCT) from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor. Twenty-five patients (10 male and 15 female) of median age 10 years (range, 5-16 years) were treated with intravenous busulfan at weight-based dosing from Day -10 to Day -7 pretransplant [see Table 1]), intravenous thiotepa 5 mg/kg twice on Day -6, intravenous cyclophosphamide 40 mg/kg/day on Day -5 to Day -2, and marrow infusion on Day 0. All patients had also received precytoreduction with hydroxyurea, azathioprine and fludarabine prior to start of the preparative regimen. Efficacy was based on the incidence of graft rejection (primary or late rejection). The incidence of graft rejection in these 25 patients using thiotepa was 0% (95% CI: [0, 0.12]). Of the 51 patients who received the same preparative regimen, historically, without thiotepa, the incidence of graft rejection reported was 25.5% (95% CI: [0.13, 0.37])."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Thiotepa is a cytotoxic agent of the polyfunctional type, related chemically and pharmacologically to nitrogen mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethylenimine radicals which, like irradiation, disrupt the bonds of DNA. One of the principal bond disruptions is initiated by alkylation of guanine at the N-7 position, which severs the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberates alkylated guanines. The pharmacokinetics of thiotepa and TEPA in thirteen female patients (45 to 84 years) with advanced stage ovarian cancer receiving 60 mg and 80 mg thiotepa by intravenous infusion on subsequent courses given at 4-week intervals are presented in the following table: Mean \u00b1 SEM Pharmacokinetic Parameters Thiotepa TEPA (units) 60 mg 80 mg 60 mg 80 mg Peak Serum concentration (ng/mL) 1331 \u00b1 119 1828 \u00b1 135 273 \u00b1 46 353 \u00b1 46 Elimination half-life (h) 2.4 \u00b1 0.3 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 17.6 \u00b1 3.6 15.7 \u00b1 2.7 Area under the curve (ng/h/mL) 2832 \u00b1 412 4127 \u00b1 668 4789 \u00b1 1022 7452 \u00b1 1667 Total body clearance (mL/min) 446 \u00b1 63 419 \u00b1 56 TEPA, which possesses cytotoxic activity, appears to be the major metabolite of thiotepa found in human serum and urine. Urinary excretion of 14 C-labeled thiotepa and metabolites in a 34 year old patient with metastatic carcinoma of the cecum who received a dose of 0.3 mg/kg intravenously was 63%. Thiotepa and TEPA in urine each accounts for less than 2% of the administered dose. The pharmacokinetics of thiotepa in renal and hepatic dysfunction patients have not been evaluated. Possible pharmacokinetic interactions of thiotepa with any concomitantly administered medications have not been formally investigated."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Thiotepa is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to this preparation. Therapy is probably contraindicated in cases of existing hepatic, renal, or bone-marrow damage. However, if the need outweighs the risk in such patients, thiotepa may be used in low dosage, and accompanied by hepatic, renal and hemopoietic function tests."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Death has occurred after intravesical administration, caused by bone-marrow depression from systematically absorbed drug. Death from septicemia and hemorrhage has occurred as a direct result of hematopoietic depression by thiotepa. Thiotepa is highly toxic to the hematopoietic system. A rapidly falling white blood cell or platelet count indicates the necessity for discontinuing or reducing the dosage of thiotepa. Weekly blood and platelet counts are recommended during therapy and for at least 3 weeks after therapy has been discontinued. Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal (IP) route was teratogenic in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (0.8 mg/kg, 27 mg/m 2 ), based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Effective contraception should be used during thiotepa therapy if either the patient or partner is of childbearing potential. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If thiotepa is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs during thiotepa therapy, the patient and partner should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Thiotepa is a polyfunctional alkylating agent, capable of cross-linking the DNA within a cell and changing its nature. The replication of the cell is, therefore, altered, and thiotepa may be described as mutagenic. An in vitro study has shown that it causes chromosomal aberrations of the chromatid type and that the frequency of induced aberrations increases with the age of the subject. Like many alkylating agents, thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals. Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice, but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man. In patients treated with thiotepa, cases of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia have been reported."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The serious complication of excessive thiotepa therapy, or sensitivity to the effects of thiotepa, is bone-marrow depression. If proper precautions are not observed thiotepa may cause leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Information for Patients The patient should notify the physician in the case of any sign of bleeding (epistaxis, easy bruising, change in color of urine, black stool) or infection (fever, chills) or for possible pregnancy to patient or partner. Effective contraception should be used during thiotepa therapy if either the patient or the partner is of childbearing potential. Laboratory Tests The most reliable guide to thiotepa toxicity is the white blood cell count. If this falls to 3000 or less, the dose should be discontinued. Another good index of thiotepa toxicity is the platelet count; if this falls to 150,000, therapy should be discontinued. Red blood cell count is a less accurate indicator of thiotepa toxicity. If the drug is used in patients with hepatic or renal damage (see CONTRAINDICATIONS section), regular assessment of hepatic and renal function tests are indicated. Drug Interactions It is not advisable to combine, simultaneously or sequentially, cancer chemotherapeutic agents or a cancer chemotherapeutic agent and a therapeutic modality having the same mechanism of action. Therefore, thiotepa combined with other alkylating agents such as nitrogen mustard or cyclophosphamide or thiotepa combined with irradiation would serve to intensify toxicity rather than to enhance therapeutic response. If these agents must follow each other, it is important that recovery from the first agent, as indicated by white blood cell count, be complete before therapy with the second agent is instituted. Other drugs which are known to produce bone-marrow depression should be avoided. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Also see WARNINGS section. Carcinogenesis In mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (1.15 or 2.3 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 43 weeks, respectively) produced a significant increase in the combined incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin, preputial gland, and ear canal, and combined incidence of lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia. In other studies in mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (4 or 8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 20 week observation period or 1.8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 35 week observation period) resulted in an increased incidence of lung tumors. In rats, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (0.7 or 1.4 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 34 weeks, respectively) produced significant increases in the incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin or ear canal, combined hematopoietic neoplasms, and uterine adenocarcinomas. Thiotepa given intravenously (IV) to rats (1 mg/kg once per week for 52 weeks) produced an increased incidence of malignant tumors (abdominal cavity sarcoma, lymphosarcoma myelosis, seminoma, fibrosarcoma, salivary gland hemangioendothelioma, mammary sarcoma, pheochromocytoma) and benign tumors. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in mice (1.15 mg/kg, 3.68 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in rats (0.7 mg/kg, 4.9 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 6-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Mutagenesis Thiotepa was mutagenic in in vitro assays in Salmonella typhimurium, E coli , Chinese hamster lung and human lymphocytes. Chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges were observed in vitro with thiotepa in bean root tips, human lymphocytes, Chinese hamster lung, and monkey lymphocytes. Mutations were observed with oral thiotepa in mouse at doses > 2.5 mg/kg (8 mg/m 2 ). The mouse micronucleus test was positive with IP administration of > 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ). Other positive in vivo chromosomal aberration or mutation assays included Drosophila melanogaster , Chinese hamster marrow, murine marrow, monkey lymphocyte, and murine germ cell. Impairment of Fertility Thiotepa impaired fertility in male mice at PO or IP doses \u2265 0.7 mg/kg (2.24 mg/m 2 ), approximately 12-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa (0.5 mg) inhibited implantation in female rats when instilled into the uterine cavity. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in mice at IP doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg (1.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 17-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in hamsters at an IP dose of 1 mg/kg (4.1 mg/m 2 ), approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects- Category D See WARNINGS section. Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses \u22653 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Patients of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If thiotepa is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs during thiotepa therapy, the patient and partner should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether thiotepa is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for thiotepa in animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of thiotepa did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreasing hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General The serious complication of excessive thiotepa therapy, or sensitivity to the effects of thiotepa, is bone-marrow depression. If proper precautions are not observed thiotepa may cause leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia."
    ],
    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients The patient should notify the physician in the case of any sign of bleeding (epistaxis, easy bruising, change in color of urine, black stool) or infection (fever, chills) or for possible pregnancy to patient or partner. Effective contraception should be used during thiotepa therapy if either the patient or the partner is of childbearing potential."
    ],
    "laboratory_tests": [
      "Laboratory Tests The most reliable guide to thiotepa toxicity is the white blood cell count. If this falls to 3000 or less, the dose should be discontinued. Another good index of thiotepa toxicity is the platelet count; if this falls to 150,000, therapy should be discontinued. Red blood cell count is a less accurate indicator of thiotepa toxicity. If the drug is used in patients with hepatic or renal damage (see CONTRAINDICATIONS section), regular assessment of hepatic and renal function tests are indicated."
    ],
    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions It is not advisable to combine, simultaneously or sequentially, cancer chemotherapeutic agents or a cancer chemotherapeutic agent and a therapeutic modality having the same mechanism of action. Therefore, thiotepa combined with other alkylating agents such as nitrogen mustard or cyclophosphamide or thiotepa combined with irradiation would serve to intensify toxicity rather than to enhance therapeutic response. If these agents must follow each other, it is important that recovery from the first agent, as indicated by white blood cell count, be complete before therapy with the second agent is instituted. Other drugs which are known to produce bone-marrow depression should be avoided."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Also see WARNINGS section. Carcinogenesis In mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (1.15 or 2.3 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 43 weeks, respectively) produced a significant increase in the combined incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin, preputial gland, and ear canal, and combined incidence of lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia. In other studies in mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (4 or 8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 20 week observation period or 1.8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 35 week observation period) resulted in an increased incidence of lung tumors. In rats, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (0.7 or 1.4 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 34 weeks, respectively) produced significant increases in the incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin or ear canal, combined hematopoietic neoplasms, and uterine adenocarcinomas. Thiotepa given intravenously (IV) to rats (1 mg/kg once per week for 52 weeks) produced an increased incidence of malignant tumors (abdominal cavity sarcoma, lymphosarcoma myelosis, seminoma, fibrosarcoma, salivary gland hemangioendothelioma, mammary sarcoma, pheochromocytoma) and benign tumors. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in mice (1.15 mg/kg, 3.68 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in rats (0.7 mg/kg, 4.9 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 6-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Mutagenesis Thiotepa was mutagenic in in vitro assays in Salmonella typhimurium, E coli , Chinese hamster lung and human lymphocytes. Chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges were observed in vitro with thiotepa in bean root tips, human lymphocytes, Chinese hamster lung, and monkey lymphocytes. Mutations were observed with oral thiotepa in mouse at doses > 2.5 mg/kg (8 mg/m 2 ). The mouse micronucleus test was positive with IP administration of > 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ). Other positive in vivo chromosomal aberration or mutation assays included Drosophila melanogaster , Chinese hamster marrow, murine marrow, monkey lymphocyte, and murine germ cell. Impairment of Fertility Thiotepa impaired fertility in male mice at PO or IP doses \u2265 0.7 mg/kg (2.24 mg/m 2 ), approximately 12-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa (0.5 mg) inhibited implantation in female rats when instilled into the uterine cavity. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in mice at IP doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg (1.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 17-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in hamsters at an IP dose of 1 mg/kg (4.1 mg/m 2 ), approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area."

Hypersensitivity Reactions Allergic reactions - rash, urticaria, laryngeal edema, asthma, anaphylactic shock, wheezing. Local Reactions Contact dermatitis, pain at the injection site. Gastrointestinal Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia. Renal Dysuria, urinary retention. There have been rare reports of chemical cystitis or hemorrhagic cystitis following intravesical, but not parenteral administration of thiotepa. Respiratory Prolonged apnea has been reported when succinylcholine was administered prior to surgery, following combined use of thiotepa and other anticancer agents. It was theorized that this was caused by decrease of pseudocholinesterase activity caused by the anticancer drugs. Neurologic Dizziness, headache, blurred vision. Skin Dermatitis, alopecia. Skin depigmentation has been reported following topical use. Special Senses Conjunctivitis. Reproductive Amenorrhea, interference with spermatogenesis."

      "OVERDOSAGE Hematopoietic toxicity can occur following overdose, manifested by a decrease in the white cell count and/or platelets. Red blood cell count is a less accurate indicator of thiotepa toxicity. Bleeding manifestations may develop. The patient may become more vulnerable to infection, and less able to combat such infection. Dosages within and minimally above the recommended therapeutic doses have been associated with potentially life-threatening hematopoietic toxicity. Thiotepa has a toxic effect on the hematopoietic system that is dose related. Thiotepa is dialyzable. There is no known antidote for overdosage with thiotepa. Transfusions of whole blood or platelets have proven beneficial to the patient in combating hematopoietic toxicity."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Since absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is variable, thiotepa should not be administered orally. Dosage must be carefully individualized. A slow response to thiotepa does not necessarily indicate a lack of effect. Therefore, increasing the frequency of dosing may only increase toxicity. After maximum benefit is obtained by initial therapy, it is necessary to continue the patient on maintenance therapy (1 to 4 week intervals). In order to continue optimal effect, maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly in order to preserve correlation between dose and blood counts. Preparation and Administration Precautions Thiotepa is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be exercised in handling and preparation of thiotepa. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may occur. The use of gloves is recommended. If thiotepa solution contacts the skin, immediately wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water. If thiotepa contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed thoroughly with water. Preparation of Solution Thiotepa for injection should be reconstituted with 1.5 mL of sterile water for injection resulting in a drug concentration of approximately 10 mg/mL . The actual withdrawable quantities and concentration achieved are illustrated in the following table: Label Claim (mg/vial) Actual Content (mg/vial) Amount of Diluent to be Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Amount (mg/vial) Approximate Reconstituted Concentration (mg/mL) 15 15.6 1.5 1.4 14.7 10.4 The reconstituted solution is hypotonic and should be further diluted with sodium chloride injection (0. 9% sodium chloride) before use. When reconstituted with sterile water for injection, solutions of thiotepa should be stored in a refrigerator and used within 8 hours. Reconstituted solutions further diluted with sodium chloride injection should be used immediately. In order to eliminate haze, filter solutions through a 0.22 micron filter* prior to administration. Filtering does not alter solution potency. Reconstituted solutions should be clear. Solutions that remain opaque or precipitate after filtration should not be used. *Polysulfone membrane (Gelman\u2019s Sterile Aerodisc \u00ae , Single Use) or triton-free mixed ester of cellulose/PVC (Millipore\u2019s MILLEX \u00ae -GS Filter Unit). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Initial and Maintenance Doses Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Intravenous Administration Thiotepa may be given by rapid intravenous administration in doses of 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Intracavitary Administration The dosage recommended is 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg. Administration is usually effected through the same tubing which is used to remove the fluid from the cavity involved. Intravesical Administration Patients with papillary carcinoma of the bladder are dehydrated for 8 to 12 hours prior to treatment. Then 60 mg of thiotepa in 30 to 60 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection is instilled into the bladder by catheter. For maximum effect, the solution should be retained for 2 hours. If the patient finds it impossible to retain 60 mL for 2 hours, the dose may be given in a volume of 30 mL. If desired, the patient may be positioned every 15 minutes for maximum area contact. The usual course of treatment is once a week for 4 weeks. The course may be repeated if necessary, but second and third courses must be given with caution since bone-marrow depression may be increased. Deaths have occurred after intravesical administration, caused by bone-marrow depression from systemically absorbed drug. Handling and Disposal Follow safe cytotoxic agent handling procedures. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. 1-7 There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate."

Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures 1 . Reconstitution Reconstitute thiotepa for injection 100 mg with 10 ml of sterile water for injection. Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 10 ml of sterile water for injection. Inject the content of the syringe into the vial through the rubber stopper. Remove the syringe and needle, and mix manually by repeated inversions. The reconstituted solution is hypotonic and must be diluted in saline prior to administration. Reconstituted solutions, free of visible particulate matter, may occasionally show opalescence; such solutions can still be used for further dilution. If not used immediately after reconstitution, the product is stable for 8 hours when stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). Discard unused portion.

      "2.1 Recommended Dosage Adenocarcinoma of the Breast or Ovary The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast or ovary is 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg intravenously. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly. Malignant Effusions The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of malignant effusions is 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg intracavitary. Administration is usually effected through the same tubing which is used to remove the fluid from the cavity involved. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly. Superficial Papillary Carcinoma of the Urinary Bladder The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder is 60 mg in 30 to 60 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection into the bladder by catheter. The solution should be retained for 2 hours. If the patient finds it impossible to retain 60 mL for 2 hours, the dose may be given in a volume of 30 mL. The patient may be repositioned every 15 minutes for maximum area contact. The usual course of treatment is once a week for 4 weeks. The course may be repeated if necessary, but second and third courses must be given with caution since bone-marrow depression may be increased.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cutaneous toxicity: Cleanse skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after the last dose of thiotepa for injection. ( 5.3) Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression The consequence of treatment with high doses of thiotepa for injection together with other chemotherapy is profound myelosuppression occurring in all patients. Monitor complete blood counts, and provide supportive care for infections, anemia and thrombocytopenia until there is adequate hematopoietic recovery. For patients receiving thiotepa for injection for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder, if the bone marrow has been compromised by prior irradiation or chemotherapy, or is recovering from chemotherapy, the risk of severe myelosuppression with thiotepa for injection may be increased. Perform periodic complete blood counts during the course of treatment with thiotepa for injection. Provide supportive care for infections, bleeding, and symptomatic anemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )] . Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA\u2019s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred following administration of thiotepa for injection. If anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, discontinue treatment with thiotepa for injection, initiate appropriate therapy, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4) , Adverse Reactions (6.1 )] . 5.3 Cutaneous Toxicity Thiotepa for injection and/or its active metabolites may be excreted in part via skin patients receiving high-dose therapy. Treatment with thiotepa for injection may cause skin discoloration, pruritus, blistering, desquamation, and peeling that may be more severe in the groin, axillae, skin folds, in the neck area, and under dressings. Instruct patients to shower or bathe with water at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of thiotepa for injection. Change occlusive dressing and clean the covered skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of thiotepa for injection. Change bed sheets daily during treatment. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa for injection may also occur. Wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water in case thiotepa solution contacts the skin. Flush mucous membranes in case of thiotepa for injection contact with mucous membranes. 5.4 Concomitant Use of Live and Attenuated Vaccines Do not administer live or attenuated viral or bacterial vaccines to a patient treated with thiotepa for injection until the immunosuppressive effects have resolved. 5.5 Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease Hepatic veno-occlusive disease may occur in patients who have received high-dose thiotepa for injection in conjunction with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Monitor by physical examination, serum transaminases and bilirubin, and provide supportive care to patients who develop hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA\u2019s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.6 Central Nervous System Toxicity Fatal encephalopathy has occurred in patients treated with high doses of thiotepa. Other central nervous system toxicities, such as headache, apathy, psychomotor retardation, disorientation, confusion, amnesia, hallucinations, drowsiness, somnolence, seizures, coma, inappropriate behavior and forgetfulness have been reported to occur in a dose-dependent manner during or shortly after administration of high-dose thiotepa. Do not exceed the recommended dose of thiotepa. If severe or life-threatening central nervous system toxicity occurs, discontinue administration of thiotepa for injection and provide supportive care. Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA\u2019s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.7 Carcinogenicity Like many alkylating agents, thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals [see Nonclinical Toxicity (13.1) ] . Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice, but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man. There is an increased risk of a secondary malignancy with use of thiotepa for injection. 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, thiotepa for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of thiotepa for injection in pregnant women. Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal (IP) route was teratogenic in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (0.8 mg/kg, 27 mg/m 2 ), based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during and after treatment with thiotepa for injection for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with thiotepa for injection for at least 1 year after therapy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) ].",

Avoid coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir) and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin) with thiotepa due to the potential effects on efficacy and toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider alternative medications with no or minimal potential to inhibit or induce CYP3A4. If concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 modulators cannot be avoided, closely monitor for adverse drug reactions. 7.2 Effect of Thiotepa for Injection on Cytochrome CYP2B6 Substrates In vitro studies suggest that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6. Thiotepa for injection may increase the exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP2B6 in patients; however, the clinical relevance of this in vitro interaction is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 )] . The administration of thiotepa with cyclophosphamide in patients reduces the conversion of cyclophosphamide to the active metabolite, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide; the effect appears sequence dependent with a greater reduction in the conversion to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide when thiotepa is administered 1.5 hours prior to the intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide compared to administration of thiotepa after intravenous cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 )] . The reduction in 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide levels may potentially reduce efficacy of cyclophosphamide treatment.",

However, due to Adienne SA\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Thiotepa for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on findings from animals and the drug\u2019s mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 ) ]. Limited available data with thiotepa for injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, administration of thiotepa to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis produced teratogenic effects (neural tube defects and malformations of the skeletal system of the fetus) at doses approximately 0.125 and 1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area [see Data]. Consider the benefits and risks of thiotepa for injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing thiotepa for injection to a pregnant woman. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Thiotepa given by the IP route in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area, and in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area, resulted in various malformations including neural tube defects, omphalocele, renal agenesis, atresia ani, limb and digit defects, cleft palate, micrognathia, other skeletal anomalies in the skull, vertebrae and ribs, and reduced skeletal ossification. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of thiotepa in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including the potential for tumorigenicity shown for thiotepa in animal studies, advise patients not to breastfeed during thiotepa for injection treatment. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy testing Thiotepa for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating thiotepa for injection therapy. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during thiotepa for injection treatment and for at least 6 months after the final dose of thiotepa for injection. Advise females to immediately report pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 )]. Males Thiotepa for injection may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue, resulting in possible genetic abnormalities. Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during thiotepa for injection treatment and for at least 1 year after the final dose of thiotepa for injection [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Infertility Based on nonclinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with thiotepa for injection. Inform male patients about the possibility of sperm conservation before the start of therapy [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of thiotepa for injection in neonates have not been established. Safety and effectiveness of thiotepa for injection for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA\u2019s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of thiotepa for injection for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreasing hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with moderate (creatinine clearance (CLcr) of 30 mL/min to 59 mL/min) renal impairment, decreased renal excretion may result in increased plasma levels of thiotepa and TEPA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . This may result in increased toxicity. Monitor patients with moderate to severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment for signs and symptoms of toxicity following treatment with thiotepa for injection for an extended period of time. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Thiotepa is extensively metabolized in the liver. Patients with moderate (bilirubin levels greater than 1.5 times to 3 times the upper limit of normal and any AST) hepatic impairment may have increased plasma levels of thiotepa [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 ) ] . This may result in toxicity. Monitor patients with moderate to severe (bilirubin levels greater than 3 times upper limit of normal and any AST) hepatic impairment for signs and symptoms of toxicity following treatment with thiotepa for injection for an extended period of time."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thiotepa is a cytotoxic agent of the polyfunctional type, related chemically and pharmacologically to the nitrogen mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethyleneimine radicals which, like irradiation, disrupt the bonds of DNA. One of the principle bond disruptions is initiated by alkylation of guanine at the N-7 position, which severs the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberates alkylated guanines. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Absorption Thiotepa reached maximal concentrations close to the end infusion following an intravenous infusion. Distribution The binding of thiotepa to plasma proteins is approximately 10% to 20%. In adults administered intravenous thiotepa between 20 mg to 250 mg/m 2 as an intravenous bolus or infusion up to 4 hours, the mean volume of distribution of thiotepa ranged from 1 L/kg (30%) to 1.9 L/kg (17%). Elimination In adults administered intravenous thiotepa between 20 mg to 250 mg/m 2 as an intravenous bolus or infusion up to 4 hours, the mean thiotepa clearance ranged from 14.6 L/hr/m 2 (23%) to 27.9 L/hr/m 2 (69%). In adult population, the mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 1.4 hours (7%) to 3.7 hours (14%) for thiotepa and from 4.9 hours to 17.6 hours (20%) for TEPA. Metabolism Thiotepa undergoes hepatic metabolism. In vitro data suggests that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 may be responsible for the metabolism of thiotepa to TEPA, a major active metabolite. Excretion In adult patients, urinary excretion of thiotepa accounted for less than 2% of the dose and TEPA accounted for 11% or less of the dose. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment The exposure (as measured by area under the curve (AUC)) of thiotepa increased by 1.6-fold and 1.8-fold following administration of multiple thiotepa doses of 7 mg/kg administered every 2 days with cyclophosphamide in two adult patients who had liver metastases with moderate hepatic impairment compared to the exposure observed in one patient with normal hepatic function . The effect of severe hepatic impairment on thiotepa exposure is unknown. Renal Impairment The exposure (as measured by AUC) of thiotepa increased by 1.4-fold and TEPA increased by 2.6-fold following administration of multiple doses of 120 mg/m 2 /day in one patient with moderate renal impairment (CLcr = 38 mL/min) administered cyclophosphamide plus thiotepa plus carboplatin, compared to exposure of thiotepa in patients with normal renal function. The effects of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease on thiotepa exposure are unknown. Drug Interactions The clinical relevance of in vitro inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzymes described below is unknown, but it cannot be excluded that the systemic exposure of thiotepa or medicinal products that are substrates for these enzymes may be affected with concomitant administration with thiotepa for injection. Effect of Cytochrome P450 Modulators on Thiotepa In vitro data demonstrates that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inhibitors decrease the metabolism of thiotepa [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Effect of Thiotepa on Cytochrome P450 2B6 In vitro data demonstrates that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6. Effect of Thiotepa on Cyclophosphamide The administration of thiotepa 1.5 hours prior to intravenous cyclophosphamide in patients administered cyclophosphamide plus thiotepa plus carboplatin decreased the AUC of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide by 26% and maximal concentrations of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide by 62%, compared to administration of cyclophosphamide prior to thiotepa.

In other studies in mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (4 or 8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 20 week observation period or 1.8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 35 week observation period) resulted in an increased incidence of lung tumors. In rats, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (0.7 or 1.4 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 34 weeks, respectively) produced significant increases in the incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin or ear canal, combined hematopoietic neoplasms, and uterine adenocarcinomas. Thiotepa given intravenously (IV) to rats (1 mg/kg once per week for 52 weeks) produced an increased incidence of malignant tumors (abdominal cavity sarcoma, lymphosarcoma myelosis, seminoma, fibrosarcoma, salivary gland hemangioendothelioma, mammary sarcoma, pheochromocytoma) and benign tumors. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in mice (1.15 mg/kg, 3.68 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in rats (0.7 mg/kg, 4.9 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 6-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was mutagenic in in vitro assays in Salmonella typhimurium, E coli , Chinese hamster lung and human lymphocytes. Chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges were observed in vitro with thiotepa in bean root tips, human lymphocytes, Chinese hamster lung, and monkey lymphocytes. Mutations were observed with oral thiotepa in mouse at doses > 2.5 mg/kg (8 mg/m 2 ). The mouse micronucleus test was positive with intraperitoneal administration of > 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ). Other positive in vivo chromosomal aberration or mutation assays included Drosophila melanogaster , Chinese hamster marrow, murine marrow, monkey lymphocyte, and murine germ cell. Thiotepa impaired fertility in male mice at oral or intraperitoneal doses \u2265 0.7 mg/kg (2.24 mg/m 2 ), approximately 12-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa (0.5 mg) inhibited implantation in female rats when instilled into the uterine cavity. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in mice at IP doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg (1.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 17-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast or ovary is 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg intravenously. (2.1) The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of malignant effusions is 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg intracavitary. (2.1) The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder is 60 mg in 30 to 60 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection into the bladder by catheter. (2.1) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Adenocarcinoma of the Breast or Ovary The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast or ovary is 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg intravenously. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly. Malignant Effusions The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of malignant effusions is 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg intracavitary. Administration is usually effected through the same tubing which is used to remove the fluid from the cavity involved. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly. Superficial Papillary Carcinoma of the Urinary Bladder The recommended dose of thiotepa for injection for treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder is 60 mg in 30 to 60 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection into the bladder by catheter. The solution should be retained for 2 hours. If the patient finds it impossible to retain 60 mL for 2 hours, the dose may be given in a volume of 30 mL. The patient may be repositioned every 15 minutes for maximum area contact. The usual course of treatment is once a week for 4 weeks. The course may be repeated if necessary, but second and third courses must be given with caution since bone-marrow depression may be increased. Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA\u2019s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.2 Preparation Instructions Thiotepa for injection is a cytotoxic drug.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cutaneous toxicity: Cleanse skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after the last dose of thiotepa. (5.3) Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy. (5.8) 5.1 Myelosuppression The consequence of treatment with high doses of thiotepa together with other chemotherapy is profound myelosuppression occurring in all patients. Monitor complete blood counts, and provide supportive care for infections, anemia and thrombocytopenia until there is adequate hematopoietic recovery. For patients receiving thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder, if the bone marrow has been compromised by prior irradiation or chemotherapy, or is recovering from chemotherapy, the risk of severe myelosuppression with thiotepa may be increased. Perform periodic complete blood counts during the course of treatment with thiotepa. Provide supportive care for infections, bleeding, and symptomatic anemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA\u2019s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred following administration of thiotepa. If anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, discontinue treatment with thiotepa, initiate appropriate therapy, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4) , Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.3 Cutaneous Toxicity Thiotepa and/or its active metabolites may be excreted in part via skin patients receiving high-dose therapy. Treatment with thiotepa may cause skin discoloration, pruritus, blistering, desquamation, and peeling that may be more severe in the groin, axillae, skin folds, in the neck area, and under dressings. Instruct patients to shower or bathe with water at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of thiotepa. Change occlusive dressing and clean the covered skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of thiotepa. Change bed sheets daily during treatment. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may also occur. Wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water in case thiotepa solution contacts the skin. Flush mucous membranes in case of thiotepa contact with mucous membranes. 5.4 Concomitant Use of Live and Attenuated Vaccines Do not administer live or attenuated viral or bacterial vaccines to a patient treated with thiotepa until the immunosuppressive effects have resolved. 5.5 Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease Hepatic veno-occlusive disease may occur in patients who have received high-dose thiotepa in conjunction with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Monitor by physical examination, serum transaminases and bilirubin and provide supportive care to patients who develop hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA\u2019s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.6 Central Nervous System Toxicity Fatal encephalopathy has occurred in patients treated with high doses of thiotepa. Other central nervous system toxicities, such as headache, apathy, psychomotor retardation, disorientation, confusion, amnesia, hallucinations, drowsiness, somnolence, seizures, coma, inappropriate behaviour and forgetfulness have been reported to occur in a dose-dependent manner during or shortly after administration of high-dose thiotepa. Do not exceed the recommended dose of thiotepa. If severe or life-threatening central nervous system toxicity occurs, discontinue administration of thiotepa and provide supportive care. Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA\u2019s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.7 Carcinogenicity Like many alkylating agents, thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals [see Nonclinical Toxicity (13.1) ] . Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice, but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man. There is an increased risk of a secondary malignancy with use of thiotepa. 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of thiotepa in pregnant women. Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal (IP) route was teratogenic in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (0.8 mg/kg, 27 mg/m 2 ), based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3)] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during and after treatment with thiotepa for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with thiotepa for at least 1 year after therapy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3)] .",

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gland Pharma at 609-250-7990 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions with treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia. General: Fatigue, weakness. Febrile reaction and discharge from a subcutaneous lesion may occur as the result of breakdown of tumor tissue. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Allergic reactions - rash, urticaria, laryngeal edema, asthma, anaphylactic shock, wheezing. Local Reactions: Contact dermatitis, pain at the injection site. Neurologic: Dizziness, headache, blurred vision. Renal: Dysuria, urinary retention, chemical cystitis or hemorrhagic cystitis. Reproductive: Amenorrhea, interference with spermatogenesis.

Avoid coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir) and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin) with thiotepa due to the potential effects on efficacy and toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider alternative medications with no or minimal potential to inhibit or induce CYP3A4. If concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 modulators cannot be avoided, closely monitor for adverse drug reactions. 7.2 Effect of Thiotepa on Cytochrome CYP2B6 Substrates In vitro studies suggest that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6. Thiotepa may increase the exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP2B6 in patients; however, the clinical relevance of this in vitro interaction is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . The administration of thiotepa with cyclophosphamide in patients reduces the conversion of cyclophosphamide to the active metabolite, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide; the effect appears sequence dependent with a greater reduction in the conversion to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide when thiotepa is administered 1.5 hours prior to the intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide compared to administration of thiotepa after intravenous cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .

(8.6 , 12.2 ) Moderate or severe hepatic impairment: Monitor patients more frequently for toxicity. ( 8.7 , 12.2 ) Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA' s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA's marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on findings from animals and the drug\u2019s mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 )] . Limited available data with thiotepa use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, administration of thiotepa to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis produced teratogenic effects (neural tube defects and malformations of the skeletal system of the fetus) at doses approximately 0.125 and 1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area [see Data] . Consider the benefits and risks of thiotepa for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing thiotepa to a pregnant woman. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Thiotepa given by the IP route in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area, and in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area, resulted in various malformations including neural tube defects, omphalocele, renal agenesis, atresia ani, limb and digit defects, cleft palate, micrognathia, other skeletal anomalies in the skull, vertebrae and ribs, and reduced skeletal ossification. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body- surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of thiotepa in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including the potential for tumorigenicity shown for thiotepa in animal studies, advise patients not to breastfeed during thiotepa treatment. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy testing Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating thiotepa therapy. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during thiotepa treatment and for at least 6 months after the final dose of thiotepa. Advise females to immediately report pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Males Thiotepa may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue, resulting in possible genetic abnormalities. Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during thiotepa treatment and for at least 1 year after the final dose of thiotepa [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Infertility Based on nonclinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with thiotepa. Inform male patients about the possibility of sperm conservation before the start of therapy [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of thiotepa in neonates have not been established. Safety and effectiveness of thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA\u2019s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreasing hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with moderate (creatinine clearance (CLcr) of 30 mL/min to 59 mL/min) renal impairment, decreased renal excretion may result in increased plasma levels of thiotepa and TEPA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . This may result in increased toxicity. Monitor patients with moderate to severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment for signs and symptoms of toxicity following treatment with thiotepa for an extended period of time. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Thiotepa is extensively metabolized in the liver. Patients with moderate (bilirubin levels greater than 1.5 times to 3 times the upper limit of normal and any AST) hepatic impairment may have increased plasma levels of thiotepa [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thiotepa is a cytotoxic agent of the polyfunctional type, related chemically and pharmacologically to the nitrogen mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethyleneimine radicals which, like irradiation, disrupt the bonds of DNA. One of the principle bond disruptions is initiated by alkylation of guanine at the N-7 position,which severs the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberates alkylated guanines. 12.2 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Thiotepa reached maximal concentrations close to the end infusion following an intravenous infusion. Distribution The binding of thiotepa to plasma proteins is approximately 10% to 20%. In adults administered intravenous thiotepa between 20 mg to 250 mg/m 2 as an intravenous bolus or infusion up to 4 hours, the mean volume of distribution of thiotepa ranged from 1.0 L/kg (30%) to 1.9 L/kg (17%). Elimination In adults administered intravenous thiotepa between 20 mg to 250 mg/m 2 as an intravenous bolus or infusion up to 4 hours, the mean thiotepa clearance ranged from 14.6 L/hr/m 2 (23%) to 27.9 L/hr/m 2 (69%). In adult population, the mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 1.4 hours (7%) to 3.7 hours (14%) for thiotepa and from 4.9 hours to 17.6 hours (20%) for TEPA. Metabolism Thiotepa undergoes hepatic metabolism. In vitro data suggests that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 may be responsible for the metabolism of thiotepa to TEPA, a major active metabolite. Excretion In adult patients, urinary excretion of thiotepa accounted for less than 2% of the dose and TEPA accounted for 11% or less of the dose. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment The exposure (as measured by area under the curve (AUC)) of thiotepa increased by 1.6-fold and 1.8-fold following administration of multiple thiotepa doses of 7 mg/kg administered every 2 days with cyclophosphamide in two adult patients who had liver metastases with moderate hepatic impairment compared to the exposure observed in one patient with normal hepatic function. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on thiotepa exposure is unknown. Renal Impairment The exposure (as measured by AUC) of thiotepa increased by 1.4-fold and TEPA increased by 2.6-fold following administration of multiple doses of 120 mg/m 2 /day in one patient with moderate renal impairment (CLcr = 38 mL/min) administered cyclophosphamide plus thiotepa plus carboplatin, compared to exposure of thiotepa in patients with normal renal function. The effects of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease on thiotepa exposure are unknown. Drug Interactions The clinical relevance of in vitro inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzymes described below is unknown, but it cannot be excluded that the systemic exposure of thiotepa or medicinal products that are substrates for these enzymes may be affected with concomitant administration with thiotepa. Effect of Cytochrome P450 Modulators on Thiotepa In vitro data demonstrates that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inhibitors decrease the metabolism of thiotepa [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Effect of Thiotepa on Cytochrome P450 2B6 In vitro data demonstrates that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6. Effect of Thiotepa on Cyclophosphamide The administration of thiotepa 1.5 hours prior to intravenous cyclophosphamide in patients administered cyclophosphamide plus thiotepa plus carboplatin decreased the AUC of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide by 26% and maximal concentrations of 4hydroxycyclophosphamide by 62%, compared to administration of cyclophosphamide prior to thiotepa.

In other studies in mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (4 or 8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 20 week observation period or 1.8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 35 week observation period) resulted in an increased incidence of lung tumors. In rats, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (0.7 or 1.4 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 34 weeks, respectively) produced significant increases in the incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin or ear canal, combined hematopoietic neoplasms, and uterine adenocarcinomas. Thiotepa given intravenously (IV) to rats (1 mg/kg once per week for 52 weeks) produced an increased incidence of malignant tumors (abdominal cavity sarcoma, lymphosarcoma myelosis, seminoma, fibrosarcoma, salivary gland hemangioendothelioma, mammary sarcoma, pheochromocytoma) and benign tumors.The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in mice (1.15 mg/kg, 3.68 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in rats (0.7 mg/kg, 4.9 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 6-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was mutagenic in in vitro assays in Salmonella typhimurium , E coli, Chinese hamster lung and human lymphocytes. Chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges were observed in vitro with thiotepa in bean root tips, human lymphocytes, Chinese hamster lung, and monkey lymphocytes. Mutations were observed with oral thiotepa in mouse at doses > 2.5 mg/kg (8 mg/m 2 ). The mouse micronucleus test was positive with intraperitoneal administration of > 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ). Other positive in vivo chromosomal aberration or mutation assays included Drosophila melanogaster , Chinese hamster marrow, murine marrow, monkey lymphocyte, and murine germ cell. Thiotepa impaired fertility in male mice at oral or intraperitoneal doses \u2265 0.7 mg/kg (2.24 mg/m 2 ), approximately 12-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa (0.5 mg) inhibited implantation in female rats when instilled into the uterine cavity. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in mice at IP doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg (1.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 17-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in hamsters at an IP dose of 1 mg/kg (4.1 mg/m 2 ), approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Thiotepa is a cytotoxic agent of the polyfunctional type, related chemically and pharmacologically to nitrogen mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethylenimine radicals which, like irradiation, disrupt the bonds of DNA. One of the principal bond disruptions is initiated by alkylation of guanine at the N-7 position, which severs the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberates alkylated guanines. The pharmacokinetics of thiotepa and TEPA in thirteen female patients (45 to 84 years) with advanced stage ovarian cancer receiving 60 mg and 80 mg thiotepa by intravenous infusion on subsequent courses given at 4-week intervals are presented in the following table: Mean \u00b1 SEM Pharmacokinetic Parameters Thiotepa TEPA (units) 60 mg 80 mg 60 mg 80 mg Peak Serum concentration (ng/mL) 1331 \u00b1 119 1828 \u00b1 135 273 \u00b1 46 353 \u00b1 46 Elimination half-life (h) 2.4 \u00b1 0.3 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 17.6 \u00b1 3.6 15.7 \u00b1 2.7 Area under the curve (ng/h/mL) 2832 \u00b1 412 4127 \u00b1 668 4789 \u00b1 1022 7452 \u00b1 1667 Total body clearance (mL/min) 446 \u00b1 63 419 \u00b1 56 TEPA, which possesses cytotoxic activity, appears to be the major metabolite of thiotepa found in human serum and urine. Urinary excretion of 14 C-labeled thiotepa and metabolites in a 34 year old patient with metastatic carcinoma of the cecum who received a dose of 0.3 mg/kg intravenously was 63%. Thiotepa and TEPA in urine each accounts for less than 2% of the administered dose. The pharmacokinetics of thiotepa in renal and hepatic dysfunction patients have not been evaluated. Possible pharmacokinetic interactions of thiotepa with any concomitantly administered medications have not been formally investigated."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Thiotepa is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to this preparation. Therapy is probably contraindicated in cases of existing hepatic, renal, or bone-marrow damage. However, if the need outweighs the risk in such patients, thiotepa may be used in low dosage, and accompanied by hepatic, renal and hemopoietic function tests."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Death has occurred after intravesical administration, caused by bone-marrow depression from systematically absorbed drug. Death from septicemia and hemorrhage has occurred as a direct result of hematopoietic depression by thiotepa. Thiotepa is highly toxic to the hematopoietic system. A rapidly falling white blood cell or platelet count indicates the necessity for discontinuing or reducing the dosage of thiotepa. Weekly blood and platelet counts are recommended during therapy and for at least 3 weeks after therapy has been discontinued. Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal (IP) route was teratogenic in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (0.8 mg/kg, 27 mg/m 2 ), based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Effective contraception should be used during thiotepa therapy if either the patient or partner is of childbearing potential. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If thiotepa is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs during thiotepa therapy, the patient and partner should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Thiotepa is a polyfunctional alkylating agent, capable of cross-linking the DNA within a cell and changing its nature. The replication of the cell is, therefore, altered, and thiotepa may be described as mutagenic. An in vitro study has shown that it causes chromosomal aberrations of the chromatid type and that the frequency of induced aberrations increases with the age of the subject. Like many alkylating agents, thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals. Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice, but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man. In patients treated with thiotepa, cases of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia have been reported."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The serious complication of excessive thiotepa therapy, or sensitivity to the effects of thiotepa, is bone-marrow depression. If proper precautions are not observed thiotepa may cause leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Information for Patients The patient should notify the physician in the case of any sign of bleeding (epistaxis, easy bruising, change in color of urine, black stool) or infection (fever, chills) or for possible pregnancy to patient or partner. Effective contraception should be used during thiotepa therapy if either the patient or the partner is of childbearing potential. Laboratory Tests The most reliable guide to thiotepa toxicity is the white blood cell count. If this falls to 3000 or less, the dose should be discontinued. Another good index of thiotepa toxicity is the platelet count; if this falls to 150,000, therapy should be discontinued. Red blood cell count is a less accurate indicator of thiotepa toxicity. If the drug is used in patients with hepatic or renal damage (see CONTRAINDICATIONS section), regular assessment of hepatic and renal function tests are indicated. Drug Interactions It is not advisable to combine, simultaneously or sequentially, cancer chemotherapeutic agents or a cancer chemotherapeutic agent and a therapeutic modality having the same mechanism of action. Therefore, thiotepa combined with other alkylating agents such as nitrogen mustard or cyclophosphamide or thiotepa combined with irradiation would serve to intensify toxicity rather than to enhance therapeutic response. If these agents must follow each other, it is important that recovery from the first agent, as indicated by white blood cell count, be complete before therapy with the second agent is instituted. Other drugs which are known to produce bone-marrow depression should be avoided. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Also see WARNINGS section. Carcinogenesis In mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (1.15 or 2.3 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 43 weeks, respectively) produced a significant increase in the combined incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin, preputial gland, and ear canal, and combined incidence of lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia. In other studies in mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (4 or 8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 20 week observation period or 1.8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 35 week observation period) resulted in an increased incidence of lung tumors. In rats, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (0.7 or 1.4 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 34 weeks, respectively) produced significant increases in the incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin or ear canal, combined hematopoietic neoplasms, and uterine adenocarcinomas. Thiotepa given intravenously (IV) to rats (1 mg/kg once per week for 52 weeks) produced an increased incidence of malignant tumors (abdominal cavity sarcoma, lymphosarcoma myelosis, seminoma, fibrosarcoma, salivary gland hemangioendothelioma, mammary sarcoma, pheochromocytoma) and benign tumors. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in mice (1.15 mg/kg, 3.68 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in rats (0.7 mg/kg, 4.9 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 6-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Mutagenesis Thiotepa was mutagenic in in vitro assays in Salmonella typhimurium, E coli , Chinese hamster lung and human lymphocytes. Chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges were observed in vitro with thiotepa in bean root tips, human lymphocytes, Chinese hamster lung, and monkey lymphocytes. Mutations were observed with oral thiotepa in mouse at doses > 2.5 mg/kg (8 mg/m 2 ). The mouse micronucleus test was positive with IP administration of > 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ). Other positive in vivo chromosomal aberration or mutation assays included Drosophila melanogaster , Chinese hamster marrow, murine marrow, monkey lymphocyte, and murine germ cell. Impairment of Fertility Thiotepa impaired fertility in male mice at PO or IP doses \u2265 0.7 mg/kg (2.24 mg/m 2 ), approximately 12-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa (0.5 mg) inhibited implantation in female rats when instilled into the uterine cavity. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in mice at IP doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg (1.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 17-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in hamsters at an IP dose of 1 mg/kg (4.1 mg/m 2 ), approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects- Category D See WARNINGS section. Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses \u22653 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Patients of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If thiotepa is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs during thiotepa therapy, the patient and partner should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether thiotepa is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for thiotepa in animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of thiotepa did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreasing hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

If these agents must follow each other, it is important that recovery from the first agent, as indicated by white blood cell count, be complete before therapy with the second agent is instituted. Other drugs which are known to produce bone-marrow depression should be avoided."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Also see WARNINGS section. Carcinogenesis In mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (1.15 or 2.3 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 43 weeks, respectively) produced a significant increase in the combined incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin, preputial gland, and ear canal, and combined incidence of lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia. In other studies in mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (4 or 8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 20 week observation period or 1.8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 35 week observation period) resulted in an increased incidence of lung tumors. In rats, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (0.7 or 1.4 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 34 weeks, respectively) produced significant increases in the incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin or ear canal, combined hematopoietic neoplasms, and uterine adenocarcinomas. Thiotepa given intravenously (IV) to rats (1 mg/kg once per week for 52 weeks) produced an increased incidence of malignant tumors (abdominal cavity sarcoma, lymphosarcoma myelosis, seminoma, fibrosarcoma, salivary gland hemangioendothelioma, mammary sarcoma, pheochromocytoma) and benign tumors. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in mice (1.15 mg/kg, 3.68 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in rats (0.7 mg/kg, 4.9 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 6-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Mutagenesis Thiotepa was mutagenic in in vitro assays in Salmonella typhimurium, E coli , Chinese hamster lung and human lymphocytes. Chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges were observed in vitro with thiotepa in bean root tips, human lymphocytes, Chinese hamster lung, and monkey lymphocytes. Mutations were observed with oral thiotepa in mouse at doses > 2.5 mg/kg (8 mg/m 2 ). The mouse micronucleus test was positive with IP administration of > 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ). Other positive in vivo chromosomal aberration or mutation assays included Drosophila melanogaster , Chinese hamster marrow, murine marrow, monkey lymphocyte, and murine germ cell. Impairment of Fertility Thiotepa impaired fertility in male mice at PO or IP doses \u2265 0.7 mg/kg (2.24 mg/m 2 ), approximately 12-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa (0.5 mg) inhibited implantation in female rats when instilled into the uterine cavity. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in mice at IP doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg (1.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 17-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in hamsters at an IP dose of 1 mg/kg (4.1 mg/m 2 ), approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area."

Hypersensitivity Reactions Allergic reactions - rash, urticaria, laryngeal edema, asthma, anaphylactic shock, wheezing. Local Reactions Contact dermatitis, pain at the injection site. Gastrointestinal Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia. Renal Dysuria, urinary retention. There have been rare reports of chemical cystitis or hemorrhagic cystitis following intravesical, but not parenteral administration of thiotepa. Respiratory Prolonged apnea has been reported when succinylcholine was administered prior to surgery, following combined use of thiotepa and other anticancer agents. It was theorized that this was caused by decrease of pseudocholinesterase activity caused by the anticancer drugs. Neurologic Dizziness, headache, blurred vision. Skin Dermatitis, alopecia. Skin depigmentation has been reported following topical use. Special Senses Conjunctivitis. Reproductive Amenorrhea, interference with spermatogenesis."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Hematopoietic toxicity can occur following overdose, manifested by a decrease in the white cell count and/or platelets. Red blood cell count is a less accurate indicator of thiotepa toxicity. Bleeding manifestations may develop. The patient may become more vulnerable to infection, and less able to combat such infection. Dosages within and minimally above the recommended therapeutic doses have been associated with potentially life-threatening hematopoietic toxicity. Thiotepa has a toxic effect on the hematopoietic system that is dose related. Thiotepa is dialyzable. There is no known antidote for overdosage with thiotepa. Transfusions of whole blood or platelets have proven beneficial to the patient in combating hematopoietic toxicity."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Since absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is variable, thiotepa should not be administered orally. Dosage must be carefully individualized. A slow response to thiotepa does not necessarily indicate a lack of effect. Therefore, increasing the frequency of dosing may only increase toxicity. After maximum benefit is obtained by initial therapy, it is necessary to continue the patient on maintenance therapy (1 to 4 week intervals). In order to continue optimal effect, maintenance doses should not be administered more frequently than weekly in order to preserve correlation between dose and blood counts. Preparation and Administration Precautions Thiotepa is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be exercised in handling and preparation of thiotepa. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may occur. The use of gloves is recommended. If thiotepa solution contacts the skin, immediately wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water. If thiotepa contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed thoroughly with water. Preparation of Solution Thiotepa for injection should be reconstituted with 1.5 mL of sterile water for injection resulting in a drug concentration of approximately 10 mg/mL . The actual withdrawable quantities and concentration achieved are illustrated in the following table: Label Claim (mg/vial) Actual Content (mg/vial) Amount of Diluent to be Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Amount (mg/vial) Approximate Reconstituted Concentration (mg/mL) 15 15.6 1.5 1.4 14.7 10.4 The reconstituted solution is hypotonic and should be further diluted with sodium chloride injection (0. 9% sodium chloride) before use. When reconstituted with sterile water for injection, solutions of thiotepa should be stored in a refrigerator and used within 8 hours. Reconstituted solutions further diluted with sodium chloride injection should be used immediately. In order to eliminate haze, filter solutions through a 0.22 micron filter* prior to administration. Filtering does not alter solution potency. Reconstituted solutions should be clear. Solutions that remain opaque or precipitate after filtration should not be used. *Polysulfone membrane (Gelman\u2019s Sterile Aerodisc \u00ae , Single Use) or triton-free mixed ester of cellulose/PVC (Millipore\u2019s MILLEX \u00ae -GS Filter Unit). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Initial and Maintenance Doses Initially the higher dose in the given range is commonly administered. The maintenance dose should be adjusted weekly on the basis of pretreatment control blood counts and subsequent blood counts. Intravenous Administration Thiotepa may be given by rapid intravenous administration in doses of 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg. Doses should be given at 1 to 4 week intervals. Intracavitary Administration The dosage recommended is 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg. Administration is usually effected through the same tubing which is used to remove the fluid from the cavity involved. Intravesical Administration Patients with papillary carcinoma of the bladder are dehydrated for 8 to 12 hours prior to treatment. Then 60 mg of thiotepa in 30 to 60 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection is instilled into the bladder by catheter. For maximum effect, the solution should be retained for 2 hours. If the patient finds it impossible to retain 60 mL for 2 hours, the dose may be given in a volume of 30 mL. If desired, the patient may be positioned every 15 minutes for maximum area contact. The usual course of treatment is once a week for 4 weeks. The course may be repeated if necessary, but second and third courses must be given with caution since bone-marrow depression may be increased. Deaths have occurred after intravesical administration, caused by bone-marrow depression from systemically absorbed drug. Handling and Disposal Follow safe cytotoxic agent handling procedures. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. 1-7 There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate."

Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures 1 . Reconstitution Reconstitute thiotepa for injection 15 mg with 1.5 ml of sterile water for injection. Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 1.5 ml of sterile water for injection. Inject the content of the syringe into the vial through the rubber stopper. Remove the syringe and needle, and mix manually by repeated inversions. Reconstitute thiotepa for injection 100 mg with 10 ml of sterile water for injection. Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 10 ml of sterile water for injection. Inject the content of the syringe into the vial through the rubber stopper. Remove the syringe and needle, and mix manually by repeated inversions. The reconstituted solution is hypotonic and must be diluted in saline prior to administration. Reconstituted solutions, free of visible particulate matter, may occasionally show opalescence; such solutions can still be used for further dilution. If not used immediately after reconstitution, the product is stable for 8 hours when stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). Dilution in the infusion bag Prior to administration, dilute the reconstituted solution further with an appropriate volume of sodium chloride 0.9% solution for injection to obtain a final thiotepa for injection concentration between 0.5 and 1 mg/mL. Dilute thiotepa for injection as recommended in Table 2. Table 2: Dilution of Thiotepa for Injection in the infusion bag Calculated Thiotepa for Injection Dose Dilution Volume (Sodium Chloride 0.9% solution for injection) Less than 250 mg Appropriate volume to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL 250 mg to 500 mg 500 mL or appropriate volume to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL Greater than 500 mg 1000 mL or appropriate volume to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL After dilution the product is stable for 24 hours when stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) and for 4 hours when stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. Inspect the diluted solution visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Use thiotepa for injection diluted solutions only if free of visible particulate matter. Filter using a 0.2 micron filter prior to administration. Filtering does not alter solution potency"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cutaneous toxicity: Cleanse skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after the last dose of thiotepa for injection. ( 5.3 ) Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression The consequence of treatment with high doses of thiotepa together with other chemotherapy at the recommended dose and schedule in the preparative regimen for class 3 beta- thalassemia is profound myelosuppression occurring in all patients. Do not begin the preparative regimen if a stem cell donor is not available. Monitor complete blood counts, and provide supportive care for infections, anemia and thrombocytopenia until there is adequate hematopoietic recovery. For patients receiving thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder, if the bone marrow has been compromised by prior irradiation or chemotherapy, or is recovering from chemotherapy, the risk of severe myelosuppression with thiotepa may be increased. Perform periodic complete blood counts during the course of treatment with thiotepa. Provide supportive care for infections, bleeding, and symptomatic anemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . 5.2 Hypersensitivity Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred following administration of thiotepa. If anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, discontinue treatment with thiotepa, initiate appropriate therapy, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4) , Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . 5.3 Cutaneous Toxicity Thiotepa and/or its active metabolites may be excreted in part via skin patients receiving high-dose therapy. Treatment with thiotepa may cause skin discoloration, pruritus, blistering, desquamation, and peeling that may be more severe in the groin, axillae, skin folds, in the neck area, and under dressings. Instruct patients to shower or bathe with water at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of thiotepa. Change occlusive dressing and clean the covered skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of thiotepa. Change bed sheets daily during treatment. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may also occur. Wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water in case thiotepa solution contacts the skin. Flush mucous membranes in case of thiotepa contact with mucous membranes. 5.4 Concomitant Use of Live and Attenuated Vaccines Do not administer live or attenuated viral or bacterial vaccines to a patient treated with thiotepa until the immunosuppressive effects have resolved. 5.5 Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease Hepatic veno-occlusive disease may occur in patients who have received high-dose thiotepa in conjunction with busulfan and cyclophosphamid e [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )] . Monitor by physical examination, serum transaminases and bilirubin daily through BMT Day +28, and provide supportive care to patients who develop hepatic veno-occlusive disease. 5.6 Central Nervous System Toxicity Fatal encephalopathy has occurred in patients treated with high doses of thiotepa. Other central nervous system toxicities, such as headache, apathy, psychomotor retardation, disorientation, confusion, amnesia, hallucinations, drowsiness, somnolence, seizures, coma, inappropriate behaviour and forgetfulness have been reported to occur in a dose-dependent manner during or shortly after administration of high-dose thiotepa. In pediatric patients treated with thiotepa at the recommended dose in combination with busulfan and cyclophosphamide, 8% developed central nervous system toxicity (seizures and intracranial hemorrhage). Do not exceed the recommended dose of thiotepa. If severe or life-threatening central nervous system toxicity occurs, discontinue administration of thiotepa and provide supportive care. 5.7 Carcinogenicity Like many alkylating agents, thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals [see Nonclinical Toxicity (13.1) ] . Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice, but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man. There is an increased risk of a secondary malignancy with use of thiotepa. 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of thiotepa in pregnant women. Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal (IP) route was teratogenic in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (0.8 mg/kg, 27 mg/m 2 ), based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during and after treatment with thiotepa for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with thiotepa for at least 1 year after therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Cutaneous Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Central Nervous System Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Carcinogenicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 )] The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated alanine aminotransferase, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, elevated bilirubin, mucositis, cytomegalovirus infection, hemorrhage, diarrhea, hematuria and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novadoz Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-855-668-2369 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions With the Preparative Regimen for Class 3 Beta-Thalassemia The safety of thiotepa was evaluated by retrospective analysis of 76 pediatric patients with class 3 beta-thalassemia who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation (HSCT) using busulfan and cyclophosphamide with thiotepa (n=25) or without thiotepa (n=51) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Adverse reactions were abstracted retrospectively from the medical records. Serious adverse events that occurred in the thiotepa-treated and control cohort were, respectively: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (4% vs 2%), pneumonia (4% vs 0), seizure (4% vs 2%), subarachnoid hemorrhage (4% vs 0) and veno\u00adocclusive disease (4% vs 2%). By 90 days after HSCT, grades 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease was observed in 7 (28%) patients in the thiotepa cohort and in 13 (26%) patients in the control cohort. By 1-year after transplantation, chronic graft-versus-host disease was observed in 8 (35%) of 23 evaluable patients in the thiotepa cohort, and 7 (14%) of 49 evaluable patients in the control cohort. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with thiotepa from start of the preparative regimen through 30 days after transplantation are shown in Table 3. Table 3: Common Adverse Reactions (>5%) Occurring Through 30 Days After Transplantation In Patients With Class 3 Beta-Thalassemia Using Busulfan And Cyclophosphamide With Or Without Thiotepa in the Preparative Regimen Preparative Regimen of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide Adverse Reaction With Thiotepa Without Thiotepa N=25 patients (%) N=51 patients (%) Any Grade Grade 3-5 1 Any Grade Grade 3-5 1 Mucositis 2 16 (64%) 4 (16%) 22 (43%) 1 (2%) Cytomegalovirus Infection 12 (48%) 0 15 (29%) 0 Hemorrhage 3 7 (28%) 2 (8%) 12 (24%) 3 (6%) Diarrhea 6 (24%) 0 7 (14%) 2 (4%) Hematuria 4 5 (20%) 0 10 (20%) 3 (6%) Rash 5 3 (12%) 0 11 (22%) 0 Intracranial Hemorrhage 6 2 (8%) 1 (4%) 0 0 Pseudomonas Infection 2 (8%) 0 0 0 1 Severe, life-threatening or fatal 2 Mucositis includes mouth hemorrhage, mucosal inflammation and stomatitis 3 Hemorrhage includes all hemorrhage terms 4 Hematuria includes cystitis hemorrhagic and hematuria 5Rash includes dermatitis exfoliative, palmar erythema, rash, rash maculo-papular, rash pruritic and skin toxicity 6 Hemorrhage Intracranial includes hemorrhage intracranial and subarachnoid hemorrhage All patients in the thiotepa-treated and control cohorts developed profound cytopenias, including neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia. Table 4 shows the selected chemistry abnormalities that occurred from start of the preparative regimen through 30 days after transplantation.

General : Fatigue, weakness. Febrile reaction and discharge from a subcutaneous lesion may occur as the result of breakdown of tumor tissue. Hypersensitivity Reactions : Allergic reactions - rash, urticaria, laryngeal edema, asthma, anaphylactic shock, wheezing. Local Reactions : Contact dermatitis, pain at the injection site. Neurologic : Dizziness, headache, blurred vision. Renal : Dysuria, urinary retention, chemical cystitis or hemorrhagic cystitis. Reproductive : Amenorrhea, interference with spermatogenesis. Respiratory : Prolonged apnea has been reported when succinylcholine was administered prior to surgery, following combined use of thiotepa and other anticancer agents. It was theorized that this was caused by decrease of pseudocholinesterase activity caused by the anticancer drugs. Skin : Dermatitis, alopecia. Skin depigmentation has been reported following topical use. Special Senses : Conjunctivitis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Avoid coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir) and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin) with thiotepa due to the potential effects on efficacy and toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 )] . Consider alternative medications with no or minimal potential to inhibit or induce CYP3A4. If concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 modulators cannot be avoided, closely monitor for adverse drug reactions. 7.2 Effect of Thiotepa on Cytochrome CYP2B6 Substrates In vitro studies suggest that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6. Thiotepa may increase the exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP2B6 in patients; however, the clinical relevance of this in vitro interaction is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . The administration of thiotepa with cyclophosphamide in patients reduces the conversion of cyclophosphamide to the active metabolite, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide; the effect appears sequence dependent with a greater reduction in the conversion to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide when thiotepa is administered 1.5 hours prior to the intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide compared to administration of thiotepa after intravenous cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . The reduction in 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide levels may potentially reduce efficacy of cyclophosphamide treatment."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended. ( 8.2 ) Moderate or severe renal impairment: Monitor patients more frequently for toxicity. ( 8.6 , 12.2 ) Moderate or severe hepatic impairment: Monitor patients more frequently for toxicity. ( 8.7 , 12.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on findings from animals and the drug\u2019s mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Limited available data with thiotepa use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, administration of thiotepa to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis produced teratogenic effects (neural tube defects and malformations of the skeletal system of the fetus) at doses approximately 0.125 and 1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area [see Data] . Consider the benefits and risks of thiotepa for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing thiotepa to a pregnant woman. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Thiotepa given by the IP route in mice at doses \u2265 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area, and in rats at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area, resulted in various malformations including neural tube defects, omphalocele, renal agenesis, atresia ani, limb and digit defects, cleft palate, micrognathia, other skeletal anomalies in the skull, vertebrae and ribs, and reduced skeletal ossification. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of thiotepa in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including the potential for tumorigenicity shown for thiotepa in animal studies, advise patients not to breastfeed during thiotepa treatment. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy testing Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating thiotepa therapy. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during thiotepa treatment and for at least 6 months after the final dose of thiotepa. Advise females to immediately report pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Males Thiotepa may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue, resulting in possible genetic abnormalities. Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during thiotepa treatment and for at least 1 year after the final dose of thiotepa [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Based on nonclinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with thiotepa. Inform male patients about the possibility of sperm conservation before the start of therapy [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of thiotepa for prevention of graft rejection in pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT for class 3 beta-thalassemia was established in one prospective study and one retrospective study [see Clinical Studies (14)] that included 1 infant (1 month to 1 year), 23 children (2 to 11 years) and 13 adolescents (12 to 16 years) who received thiotepa as part of their preparative regimen. Safety and effectiveness of thiotepa in neonates have not been established. Safety and effectiveness of thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use The safety and effectiveness of thiotepa as a preparative regimen prior to allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation (HSCT) for patients with class 3 beta-thalassemia have not been established in geriatric patients. Clinical studies of thiotepa for this indication did not include subjects aged 65 and over. Clinical studies of thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreasing hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with moderate (creatinine clearance (CLcr) of 30 mL/min to 59 mL/min) renal impairment, decreased renal excretion may result in increased plasma levels of thiotepa and TEPA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . This may result in increased toxicity. Monitor patients with moderate to severe (CLcr <30 mL/min) renal impairment for signs and symptoms of toxicity following treatment with thiotepa for an extended period of time. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Thiotepa is extensively metabolized in the liver. Patients with moderate (bilirubin levels greater than 1.5 times to 3 times the upper limit of normal and any AST) hepatic impairment may have increased plasma levels of thiotepa [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . This may result in toxicity. Monitor patients with moderate to severe (bilirubin levels greater than 3 times upper limit of normal and any AST) hepatic impairment for signs and symptoms of toxicity following treatment with thiotepa for an extended period of time."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thiotepa is a cytotoxic agent of the polyfunctional type, related chemically and pharmacologically to the nitrogen mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethyleneimine radicals which, like irradiation, disrupt the bonds of DNA. One of the principle bond disruptions is initiated by alkylation of guanine at the N-7 position, which severs the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberates alkylated guanines. 12.2 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Thiotepa reached maximal concentrations close to the end infusion following an intravenous infusion. Distribution The binding of thiotepa to plasma proteins is approximately 10% to 20%. The mean volume of distribution (% coefficient of variation) of thiotepa was 30 L/m2 (44%) or 1.2 L/kg (47%) following a single intravenous infusion of thiotepa at a dose of 5 mg/kg over 3 hours in pediatric population. In adults administered intravenous thiotepa between 20 mg to 250 mg/m2 as an intravenous bolus or infusion up to 4 hours, the mean volume of distribution of thiotepa ranged from 1.0 L/kg (30%) to 1.9 L/kg (17%). Elimination Following a single intravenous infusion over 3 hours of thiotepa at a dose of 5 mg/kg in pediatric population, the estimated mean (% coefficient of variation) clearance of thiotepa was 0.58 L/hr/kg (60%) or 13.8 L/hr/m2 (52%). The mean terminal elimination half-life was 1.7 hours (64%) for thiotepa and 4 hours (29%) for its major active metabolite, N,N',N''-triethylenephosphoramide (TEPA) in pediatric population. In adults administered intravenous thiotepa between 20 mg to 250 mg/m2 as an intravenous bolus or infusion up to 4 hours, the mean thiotepa clearance ranged from 14.6 L/hr/m2 (23%) to 27.9 L/hr/m2 (69%). In adult population, the mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 1.4 hours (7%) to 3.7 hours (14%) for thiotepa and from 4.9 hours to 17.6 hours (20%) for TEPA. Metabolism Thiotepa undergoes hepatic metabolism. In vitro data suggests that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 may be responsible for the metabolism of thiotepa to TEPA, a major active metabolite. Ex cretion In adult and pediatric patients, urinary excretion of thiotepa accounted for less than 2% of the dose and TEPA accounted for 11% or less of the dose. Spec i fic Populations Hepatic Impairment The clearance of thiotepa following a single thiotepa dose of 5 mg/kg in pediatric population with mild hepatic impairment was similar to the clearance observed in patients with normal liver function administered thiotepa. The exposure (as measured by area under the curve (AUC)) of thiotepa increased by 1.6-fold and 1.8-fold following administration of multiple thiotepa doses of 7 mg/kg administered every 2 days with cyclophosphamide in two adult patients who had liver metastases with moderate hepatic impairment compared to the exposure observed in one patient with normal hepatic function. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on thiotepa exposure is unknown. Renal Impairment The exposure (as measured by AUC) of thiotepa increased by 1.4-fold and TEPA increased by 2.6-fold following administration of multiple doses of 120 mg/m2/day in one patient with moderate renal impairment (CLcr = 38 mL/min) administered cyclophosphamide plus thiotepa plus carboplatin, compared to exposure of thiotepa in patients with normal renal function. The effects of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease on thiotepa exposure are unknown. Drug Interactions The clinical relevance of in vitro inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzymes described below is unknown, but it cannot be excluded that the systemic exposure of thiotepa or medicinal products that are substrates for these enzymes may be affected with concomitant administration with thiotepa. Effect of Cytochrome P450 Modulators on Thiotepa In vitro data demonstrates that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inhibitors decrease the metabolism of thiotepa [see Drug Interactions (7.1 )]. Effect of Thiotepa on Cytochrome P450 2B6 In vitro data demonstrates that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6.

In other studies in mice, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (4 or 8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 20 week observation period or 1.8 mg/kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 35 week observation period) resulted in an increased incidence of lung tumors. In rats, repeated IP administration of thiotepa (0.7 or 1.4 mg/kg three times per week for 52 or 34 weeks, respectively) produced significant increases in the incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin or ear canal, combined hematopoietic neoplasms, and uterine adenocarcinomas. Thiotepa given intravenously (IV) to rats (1 mg/kg once per week for 52 weeks) produced an increased incidence of malignant tumors (abdominal cavity sarcoma, lymphosarcoma myelosis, seminoma, fibrosarcoma, salivary gland hemangioendothelioma, mammary sarcoma, pheochromocytoma) and benign tumors. The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in mice (1.15 mg/kg, 3.68 mg/m 2 ) is approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area.

Twenty-five patients (10 male and 15 female) of median age 10 years (range, 5-16 years) were treated with intravenous busulfan at weight-based dosing from Day -10 to Day -7 pretransplant [see Table 1] ), intravenous thiotepa 5 mg/kg twice on Day -6, intravenous cyclophosphamide 40 mg/kg/day on Day -5 to Day -2, and marrow infusion on Day 0. All patients had also received precytoreduction with hydroxyurea, azathioprine and fludarabine prior to start of the preparative regimen. Efficacy was based on the incidence of graft rejection (primary or late rejection). The incidence of graft rejection in these 25 patients using thiotepa was 0% (95% CI: [0, 0.12]). Of the 51 patients who received the same preparative regimen, historically, without thiotepa, the incidence of graft rejection reported was 25.5% (95% CI: [0.13, 0.37])."
