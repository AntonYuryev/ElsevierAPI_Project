Do not give the entire contents of the vial to a single patient. \u2022 Do not administer ascorbic acid injection as an undiluted intravenous injection. \u2022 Minimize exposure to light because ascorbic acid injection is light sensitive. \u2022 Ascorbic acid injection is supplied as a Pharmacy Bulk Package (PBP) which is intended for dispensing of single doses to multiple patients in a pharmacy admixture program and is restricted to the preparation of admixtures for infusion: a. Use only in a suitable ISO Class 5 work area such as a laminar flow hood (or an equivalent clean air compounding area). b. Penetrate each PBP vial closure only one time with a suitable sterile transfer device or dispensing set that allows measured dispensing of the contents. Given that pressure may develop within the vial during storage, exercise caution when withdrawing contents from the vial. c. Once the closure system has been penetrated, complete all dispensing from the PBP vial within 4 hours . Each dose must be used immediately . Discard unused portion. d. Prior to administration , ascorbic acid injection must be diluted in a suitable infusion solution and the final solution for infusion must be isotonic (undiluted the osmolarity of ascorbic acid injection is approximately 5,900 mOsmol/L). Prior to preparing the admixture for infusion, calculate the osmolarity of the intended admixture for infusion. Add one daily dose of ascorbic acid injection directly to an appropriate volume of a suitable infusion solution (e.g., 5% Dextrose Injection, Sterile Water for Injection) and add appropriate solutes, as necessary, to make the final solution isotonic. Sterile Water for Injection is highly hypotonic; adjust solute content, as necessary, to make the final infusion solution isotonic prior to injection. Do not mix ascorbic acid injection with solutions containing elemental compounds that can be reduced (e.g., copper). The concentration of ascorbic acid in the final, admixture solution for infusion is to be in the range of 1 to 25 mg of ascorbic acid per mL. For example, for the largest recommended dose: Add 200 mg of ascorbic acid (equivalent to 0.4 mL of ascorbic acid injection) to 7.5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection to produce an infusion solution having an approximate osmolarity of 290 mOsmol/L. In this specific example, addition of solute is NOT necessary because the solution is isotonic. e. Prepare the recommended dose based on the patient population [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), (2.3) ]. f. Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the diluted ascorbic acid injection solution should appear colorless to pale yellow). g.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Oxalate nephropathy and Nephrolithiasis : Ascorbic acid has been associated with development of acute or chronic oxalate nephropathy following prolonged use of high doses of ascorbic acid infusion. Patients with renal disease including renal impairment, history of oxalate kidney stones, geriatric patients, and pediatric patients less than 2 years old may be at increased risk ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Hemolysis : Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are at risk of severe hemolysis; a reduced dose is recommended ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Laboratory Test Interference: Ascorbic acid may interfere with laboratory tests based on oxidation-reduction reactions, including blood and urine glucose testing ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Oxalate Nephropathy and Nephrolithiasis Acute and chronic oxalate nephropathy have been reported with prolonged administration of high doses of ascorbic acid. Acidification of the urine by ascorbic acid may cause precipitation of cysteine, urate or oxalate stones. Patients with renal disease including renal impairment, history of oxalate kidney stones, and geriatric patients may be at increased risk for oxalate nephropathy while receiving treatment with ascorbic acid. Pediatric patients less than 2 years of age may be at increased risk for oxalate nephropathy during treatment with ascorbic acid because their kidneys are immature [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5, 8.6) ] . Monitor renal function in patients at increased risk receiving ascorbic Acid Injection. Discontinue ascorbic acid injection in patients who develop oxalate nephropathy and treat any suspected oxalate nephropathy. Ascorbic acid injection is not indicated for prolonged administration (the maximum recommended duration is one week) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.2 Hemolysis in Patients with Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency Hemolysis has been reported with administration of ascorbic acid in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may be at increased risk for severe hemolysis during treatment with ascorbic acid. Monitor hemoglobin and blood count and use a reduced dose of Ascorbic acid injection in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Discontinue treatment with ascorbic acid injection if hemolysis is suspected and treat as needed. 5.3 Laboratory Test Interference Ascorbic acid may interfere with laboratory tests based on oxidation-reduction reactions, including blood and urine glucose testing, nitrite and bilirubin levels, and leucocyte count testing. If possible, laboratory tests based on oxidation-reduction reactions should be delayed until 24 hours after infusion of ascorbic acid injection [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ].",

The following adverse reactions associated with the use of ascorbic acid were identified in the literature. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Administration site reactions: pain and swelling. Ascorbic acid injection should not be rapidly administered. Rapid intravenous administration (>250 mg/minute) of ascorbic acid injection may cause temporary faintness or nausea, lethargy, flushing, dizziness, and headache (the recommended infusion rates of diluted ascorbic acid injection solution are 1.3 mg/minute (Pediatric Patients age 5 months to less than 12 months), 3.3 mg/minute (Pediatric Patients age 1 year to less than 11 years) and 33 mg/minute (Adults and Pediatric Patients 11 years and older) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]). Acute and chronic oxalate nephropathy have occurred with prolonged administration of high doses of ascorbic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. In patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, severe hemolysis has occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Most common adverse reactions are pain and swelling at the site of infusion ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact [Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176] or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Antibiotics: Ascorbic acid may decrease the activities of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin. Bleomycin is inactivated in vitro by ascorbic acid ( 7.1 ). \u2022 Amphetamine and Other Drugs Affected by Urine Acidification: Ascorbic acid may cause acidification of the urine and result in decreased amphetamine serum levels and affect excretion and plasma concentrations of other drugs sensitive to urine pH ( 7.2 ). \u2022 Warfarin: Continue standard monitoring ( 7.3 ). 7.1 Antibiotics Ascorbic acid may decrease activities of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin. Bleomycin is inactivated in vitro by ascorbic acid. If the antibiotic efficacy is suspected to be decreased by concomitant administration of ascorbic acid injection, discontinue ascorbic acid injection administration. 7.2 Amphetamines & Other Drugs Affected by Urine Acidification Ascorbic acid may acidify the urine and lower serum concentrations of amphetamine by increasing renal excretion (as reflected by changes in amphetamine urine recovery rates). In case of decreased amphetamine efficacy, discontinue ascorbic acid injection administration. Standard monitoring of therapy is warranted. In addition, acidification of urine by ascorbic acid will alter the excretion of certain drugs affected by the pH of the urine (e.g., fluphenazine) when administered concurrently. It has been reported that concurrent administration of ascorbic acid and fluphenazine has resulted in decreased fluphenazine plasma concentrations. Standard monitoring of therapy is warranted. 7.3 Warfarin Limited case reports have suggested interference of ascorbic acid with the anticoagulation effects of warfarin; however, for patients on warfarin therapy treated with ascorbic acid doses up to 1000 mg/day (5 times the largest recommended single dose) for 2 weeks (twice the maximum recommended duration), no effect was observed. Standard monitoring for anti-coagulation therapy should continue during ascorbic acid treatment, as per standard of care. 7.4 Laboratory Test Interference Because ascorbic acid is a strong reducing agent, it can interfere with numerous laboratory tests based on oxidation-reduction reactions (e.g., glucose, nitrite and bilirubin levels, leukocyte count, etc.). Chemical detecting methods based on colorimetric reactions are generally those tests affected. Ascorbic acid may lead to inaccurate results (false negatives) obtained for checking blood or urinary glucose levels, nitrite, bilirubin, and leukocytes if tested during or within 24 hours after infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ].",

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on use of ascorbic acid injection in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes; however, use of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been used during pregnancy for several decades and no adverse developmental outcomes are reported in the published literature [see Data]. There are dose adjustments for ascorbic acid (vitamin C) use during pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with ascorbic acid injection. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Dose Adjustments During Pregnancy and Post-Partum Period Follow the U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for pregnant women when considering use of Ascorbic acid injection for treatment of scurvy [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Data Human Data There are no available data on use of ascorbic acid injection or another ascorbic acid injection in pregnant women. However, a published meta\u2013analysis of randomized studies evaluating a large number of pregnant women who took oral ascorbic acid (vitamin C) (through diet and supplementation) at doses ranging from 500 to 1000 mg/day (2.5 to 5 times the recommended daily intravenous dose, respectively) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] between the 9th and 16th weeks of pregnancy showed no increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage, preterm premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery or pregnancy induced hypertension when compared to placebo. These data cannot definitively establish or exclude the absence of a risk with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in human milk following intravenous dosing in lactating women. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is present in human milk after maternal oral intake. Maternal oral intake of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) exceeding the U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for lactation does not influence the ascorbic acid (vitamin C) content in breast milk or the estimated daily amount received by breastfed infants. There are no data on the effect of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) on milk production or the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ascorbic acid injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ascorbic acid injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Follow the U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for lactating women when considering use of ascorbic acid injection for treatment of scurvy [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Ascorbic acid injection is indicated for the short term (up to 1 week) treatment of scurvy in pediatric patients age 5 months and older for whom oral administration is not possible, insufficient or contraindicated. The safety profile of ascorbic acid in pediatric patients is similar to adults; however, pediatric patients less than 2 years of age may be at higher risk of oxalate nephropathy following ascorbic acid administration due to age-related decreased glomerular filtration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Ascorbic acid injection is not indicated for use in pediatric patients less than 5 months of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Glomerular filtration rate is known to decrease with age and as such may increase risk for oxalate nephropathy following ascorbic acid administration in elderly population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Ascorbic acid injection should be used with caution in scorbutic patients with a history of or risk of developing renal oxalate stones or evidence of renal impairment or other issues (e.g., patients on dialysis, patients with diabetic nephropathy, and renal transplant recipients). These patients may be at increased risk of developing acute or chronic oxalate nephropathy following high dose ascorbic acid administration [see Warning and Precautions (5.1) ].",

However, a published meta\u2013analysis of randomized studies evaluating a large number of pregnant women who took oral ascorbic acid (vitamin C) (through diet and supplementation) at doses ranging from 500 to 1000 mg/day (2.5 to 5 times the recommended daily intravenous dose, respectively) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] between the 9th and 16th weeks of pregnancy showed no increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage, preterm premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery or pregnancy induced hypertension when compared to placebo. These data cannot definitively establish or exclude the absence of a risk with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) during pregnancy."

The safety profile of ascorbic acid in pediatric patients is similar to adults; however, pediatric patients less than 2 years of age may be at higher risk of oxalate nephropathy following ascorbic acid administration due to age-related decreased glomerular filtration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Ascorbic acid injection is not indicated for use in pediatric patients less than 5 months of age."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The exact mechanism of action of ascorbic acid for the treatment of symptoms and signs of scurvy (a disorder caused by severe deficiency in vitamin C) is unknown; however, administration of ascorbic acid in patients with scurvy is thought to restore the body pool of ascorbic acid. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a single pharmacokinetic study, healthy male and female adults (n=8) were given a single intravenous dose of 1000 mg ascorbic acid (5 times the largest recommended single dose) infused over a 30 minute period. The mean peak exposure to ascorbic acid was 436.2 \u03bcM and occurred at the end of the 30 minute infusion. Distribution Ascorbic acid is distributed widely in the body, with large concentrations found in the liver, leukocytes, platelets, glandular tissues, and lens of the eye. Based on data from oral exposure, ascorbic acid is known to be distributed into breast milk and crosses the placental barrier. Elimination When the body is saturated with ascorbic acid, the plasma concentration will be about the same as that of the renal threshold; if further amounts are then administered, most of it is excreted in the urine. When body tissues are not saturated and plasma concentration is low, administration of ascorbic acid results in little or no renal excretion. The mean\u00b1SD (N=3) half-life observed in the single dose PK study, as described above, was 7.4\u00b11.4 h. Metabolism A major route of metabolism of ascorbic acid involves its conversion to urinary oxalate, presumably through intermediate formation of its oxidized product, dehydroascorbic acid. Excretion There is a renal threshold for ascorbic acid (vitamin C); the vitamin is excreted by the kidney in large amounts only when the plasma concentration exceeds this threshold, which is approximately 1.4 mg/100 mL."

( 2.1 , 5.5 ) Do not take oral medications within 1 hour of starting each dose. ( 2.1 ) Dosing Regimen: Two-Day (Split-Dose) (Preferred Method) : Dose 1 the evening before the colonoscopy, and Dose 2 the morning of the colonoscopy (approximately 12 hours after the start of Dose 1, and at least 3 \u00bd hours prior to the colonoscopy). ( 2.2 ) One-Day (Evening Only) (Alternative Method) : Dose 1 at least 3 \u00bd hours prior to bedtime the evening before the colonoscopy and Dose 2 approximately 1 \u00bd hours after starting Dose 1 the evening before the colonoscopy. ( 2.3 ) For complete information on dosing, preparation and administration see full prescribing information ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Preparation and Administration Instructions Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Two doses of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution are required for a complete preparation for colonoscopy. The time interval between the two doses depends on the regimen prescribed and the planned timing of the colonoscopy procedure. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) ] . The \"Split-Dose\" is the preferred method and consists of two separate doses: the first dose is taken the evening before the colonoscopy, and the second dose is taken the next day, the morning of the day of the colonoscopy [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. The \"Evening Only\" is the alternative method and consists of two separate doses: both doses are taken in the evening before the day of the colonoscopy, with a minimum of 1.5 hours between the start of the first dose and the start of the second dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Both PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution dosing regimens require administration of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution using the mixing container provided to reconstitute the contents of Pouch A, Pouch B and Lemon flavor pack with water to the Fill Line. Do not reconstitute with other liquids and/or add starch-based thickeners to the mixing container [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Additional clear liquids (including water) must be consumed in both dosing regimens [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Consume only clear liquids (no solid food) from the start of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution treatment until after the colonoscopy. Do not eat or drink alcohol, milk, anything colored red or purple or any other foods containing pulp material. Do not take other laxatives while taking PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution [ see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Do not take oral medications within 1 hour before or after starting each dose of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Ensure completion of Dose 2, including all additional liquids, at least 2 hours before the colonoscopy. Storage : After reconstitution, store PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution- solution in an upright position and keep refrigerated. Use within 24 hours after it is mixed in water. 2.2 Two-Day Split-Dosing Regimen (Preferred Method) The Two-Day Split-Dosing regimen is the preferred dosing method. Instruct adult patients that on the day before the clinical procedure, they can consume breakfast, followed by a light lunch (no solid foods), and clear soup and/or plain yogurt for dinner, which must be completed at least 1 hour prior to the start of the first PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution dose. Instruct adult patients to take two separate doses in conjunction with fluids as follows: Dose 1 \u2013 In the evening before the colonoscopy, approximately 10 to 12 hours before Dose 2: Empty the contents of 1 Pouch A, 1 Pouch B and 1 Lemon Flavor pack into the mixing container that comes with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Add lukewarm water to the Fill Line on the mixing container (32 fluid ounces). Do not add other ingredients to the PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution- solution. Thoroughly mix with a spoon or shake with lid on securely until the contents of Pouch A, Pouch B and Lemon flavor pack are completely dissolved. Drink 8 ounces of the solution every 15 minutes. This should take about 1 hour. Be sure to drink all the solution. Refill the mixing container halfway to the Fill Line (at least 16 ounces) with a clear liquid and drink all this liquid before going to bed. Dose 2 \u2013 Take next morning, on the day of the colonoscopy, approximately 12 hours after the start of Dose 1 and at least 3 \u00bd hours prior to colonoscopy: Empty the contents of 1 Pouch A, 1 Pouch B and 1 Lemon flavor pack into the mixing container that comes with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Add lukewarm water to the Fill Line on the mixing container (32 fluid ounces).

( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Cardiac arrhythmias : Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk. (5.2) Seizures: Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizure, including medications that lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function : Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider laboratory testing. ( 5.4 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Colonic mucosal ulcerations : Consider potential for ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. ( 5.5 ) Suspected GI obstruction or perforation : Rule out the diagnosis before administration. ( 5.6 ) Patients at risk for aspiration : Observe during administration. ( 5.7 ) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G-6-PD) : Use with caution. ( 5.8 ) Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis : Inform patients to seek immediate medical care if symptoms occur. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Bowel preparations can cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances, which can lead to serious adverse reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and renal impairment [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients using concomitant medications that increase the risk of electrolyte abnormalities [such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] or in patients with known or suspected hyponatremia. Consider performing pre-dose and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (sodium, potassium, calcium, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation) associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. These occur predominantly in patients with underlying cardiac risk factors and electrolyte disturbances. Use caution when prescribing PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or electrolyte imbalance). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been rare reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.4 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment Use PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that affect renal function (such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during, and after use of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, and consider performing pre-dose and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulceration, Ischemic Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis Osmotic laxatives may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis and is not recommended. Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution [ see Contraindications (4) ] . Use with caution in patients with severe ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Observe these patients during the administration of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Use with caution in these patients. Do not combine PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution with starch-based thickeners [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, when mixed with starch-thickened liquids reduces the viscosity of the starch-thickened liquid. When a PEG-based product used for another indication was mixed in starch-based pre-thickened liquids used in patients with dysphagia, thinning of the liquid occurred and cases of choking and potential aspiration were reported. 5.8 Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Since PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution contains sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid, PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, especially G6PD deficiency patients with an active infection, with a history of hemolysis, or taking concomitant medications known to precipitate hemolytic reactions. 5.10 Hypersensitivity Reactions PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and lemon flavoring (containing Natural Lemon Flavor, Maltodextrin and Saccharin Sodium) and may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and pruritus [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) and Description ( 11 )] . Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur."

The safety of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution as a Two-Day Split-Dosing and One-Day Evening Only Dosing Regimen was evaluated in two randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, investigator-blinded clinical trials in adult patients scheduled to have an elective colonoscopy [see Clinical Studies (14)] . The safety analysis for Study 1 included 359 adult patients ranging in age from 18 to 88 years (mean age 59), with 52% female and 48% male patients. The safety analysis for Study 2 included 340 adult patients ranging in age from 21 to 76 years (mean age 53), with 53% male and 47% female patients. Tables 1 and 2 display adverse reactions reported in at least 2% and 5% of patients in either treatment group in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively. Since diarrhea was considered as a part of the efficacy assessment, it was not defined as an adverse reaction in these trials.

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available on the presence of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed child, or the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution to a child during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 413 patients in clinical trials receiving PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, 91 (22%) patients were aged 65 or older, while 25 (6%) patients were over 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric patients and younger patients. However, elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and may be more susceptible to adverse reactions resulting from fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Use PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after the use of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The colon cleansing efficacy and safety of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution was evaluated in two randomized, actively-controlled, multi-center, investigator-blinded trials in adult patients scheduled to have an elective colonoscopy. In Study 1, patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation treatments: 1) 2 liters of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution with 1 additional liter of clear liquid split into two doses (during the evening before and the morning of the colonoscopy) and 2) 4 liters of polyethylene glycol plus electrolytes solution (4L PEG + E) split into two doses (during the evening before and the morning of the colonoscopy). Patients were allowed to have a morning breakfast, a light lunch, clear soup and/or plain yogurt for dinner. Dinner had to be completed at least one hour prior to initiation of the colon preparation administration. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with effective colon cleansing as judged by blinded gastroenterologists on the basis of videotapes recorded during the colonoscopy. The blinded gastroenterologists graded the colon cleansing twice (during introduction and withdrawal of the colonoscope) and the poorer of the two assessments was used in the primary efficacy analysis. The efficacy analysis included 308 adult patients who had an elective colonoscopy. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 88 years old (mean age about 59 years old) with 52% female and 48% male patients. Table 3 displays the results.

In Study 2, patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation treatments: 1) 2 liters of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution with 1 additional liter of clear liquid in the evening prior to the colonoscopy and 2) 90 mL of oral sodium phosphate solution (90 mL OSPS) with at least 2 liters of additional clear liquid during the day and evening prior to the colonoscopy. Patients randomized to PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution therapy were allowed to have a morning breakfast; a light lunch; and clear soup and/or plain yogurt for dinner. Dinner had to be completed at least one hour prior to initiation of the colon preparation administration. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with effective colon cleansing as judged by the colonoscopist and one blinded gastroenterologist (on the basis of videotapes recorded during the colonoscopy). In case of a discrepancy between the colonoscopist and the blinded gastroenterologist, a second blinded gastroenterologist made the final efficacy determination. The efficacy analysis included 280 adult patients who had an elective colonoscopy. Patients ranged in age from 21 to 76 years old (mean age about 53 years old) with 47% female and 53% male patients.
