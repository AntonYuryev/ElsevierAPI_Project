    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following oral administration. As a consequence of non-linear pharmacokinetics, itraconazole accumulates in plasma during multiple dosing. Steady-state concentrations are generally reached within about 15 days, with C max values of 0.5 \u03bcg/mL, 1.1 \u03bcg/mL and 2 \u03bcg/mL after oral administration of 100 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily and 200 mg b.i.d., respectively. The terminal half-life of itraconazole generally ranges from 16 to 28 hours after single dose and increases to 34 to 42 hours with repeated dosing. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. Itraconazole mean total plasma clearance following intravenous administration is 278 mL/min. Itraconazole clearance decreases at higher doses due to saturable hepatic metabolism. Absorption Itraconazole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following an oral capsule dose. The observed absolute oral bioavailability of itraconazole is about 55%. The oral bioavailability of itraconazole is maximal when itraconazole capsules are taken immediately after a full meal. Absorption of itraconazole capsules is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g., H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) Absorption of itraconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when itraconazole capsules are administered with an acidic beverage (such as a non-diet cola). When itraconazole capsules were administered as a single 200-mg dose under fasted conditions with non-diet cola after ranitidine pretreatment, a H 2 -receptor antagonist, itraconazole absorption was comparable to that observed when itraconazole capsules were administered alone. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) Itraconazole exposure is lower with the Capsule formulation than with the Oral Solution when the same dose of drug is given. (See WARNINGS.) Distribution Most of the itraconazole in plasma is bound to protein (99.8%), with albumin being the main binding component (99.6% for the hydroxy-metabolite). It has also a marked affinity for lipids. Only 0.2% of the itraconazole in plasma is present as free drug. Itraconazole is distributed in a large apparent volume in the body (>700 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Concentrations in lung, kidney, liver, bone, stomach, spleen and muscle were found to be two to three times higher than corresponding concentrations in plasma, and the uptake into keratinous tissues, skin in particular, up to four times higher. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are much lower than in plasma. Metabolism Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into a large number of metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of itraconazole. The main metabolite is hydroxy-itraconazole, which has in vitro antifungal activity comparable to itraconazole; trough plasma concentrations of this metabolite are about twice those of itraconazole. Excretion Itraconazole is excreted mainly as inactive metabolites in urine (35%) and in feces (54%) within one week of an oral solution dose. Renal excretion of itraconazole and the active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole account for less than 1% of an intravenous dose. Based on an oral radiolabeled dose, fecal excretion of unchanged drug ranges from 3% to 18% of the dose. As re-distribution of itraconazole from keratinous tissues appears to be negligible, elimination of itraconazole from these tissues is related to epidermal regeneration. Contrary to plasma, the concentration in skin persists for 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of a 4-week treatment and in nail keratin \u2013 where itraconazole can be detected as early as 1 week after start of treatment \u2013 for at least six months after the end of a 3-month treatment period. Special Populations: Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. A pharmacokinetic study using a single 200 mg oral dose of itraconazole was conducted in three groups of patients with renal impairment (uremia: n=7; hemodialysis: n=7; and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: n=5). In uremic subjects with a mean creatinine clearance of 13 mL/min. \u00d7 1.73 m 2 , the exposure, based on AUC, was slightly reduced compared with normal population parameters. This study did not demonstrate any significant effect of hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole (T max , C max , and AUC 0-8h ). Plasma concentration-versus-time profiles showed wide intersubject variation in all three groups. After a single intravenous dose, the mean terminal half-lives of itraconazole in patients with mild (defined in this study as CrCl 50 to 79 mL/min), moderate (defined in this study as CrCl 20 to 49 mL/min), and severe renal impairment (defined in this study as CrCl <20 mL/min) were similar to that in healthy subjects (range of means 42 to 49 hours vs 48 hours in renally impaired patients and healthy subjects, respectively). Overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was decreased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, as compared with subjects with normal renal function. Data are not available in renally impaired patients during long-term use of itraconazole. Dialysis has no effect on the half-life or clearance of itraconazole or hydroxy-itraconazole. (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Hepatic Impairment: Itraconazole is predominantly metabolized in the liver. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 6 healthy and 12 cirrhotic subjects who were administered a single 100 mg dose of itraconazole as capsule. A statistically significant reduction in mean C max (47%) and a twofold increase in the elimination half-life (37\u00b117 hours vs. 16\u00b15 hours) of itraconazole were noted in cirrhotic subjects compared with healthy subjects. However, overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Data are not available in cirrhotic patients during long-term use of itraconazole. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Decreased Cardiac Contractility: When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, itraconazole should be discontinued. (See BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information.) MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action: In vitro studies have demonstrated that itraconazole inhibits the cytochrome P450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. Antimicrobial Activity: Itraconazole exhibits in vitro activity against Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Histoplasma duboisii, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Trichophyton species (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Description of Clinical Studies). Susceptibility Testing Methods: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC. Resistance: Isolates from several fungal species with decreased susceptibility to itraconazole have been isolated in vitro and from patients receiving prolonged therapy. Itraconazole is not active against Zygomycetes (e.g., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Mucor spp. and Absidia spp.), Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp. Cross-Resistance: Several in vitro studies have reported that some fungal clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility to one azole antifungal agent may also be less susceptible to other azole derivatives. The finding of cross-resistance is dependent on a number of factors, including the species evaluated, its clinical history, the particular azole compounds compared, and the type of susceptibility test that is performed. Studies (both in vitro and in vivo ) suggest that the activity of amphotericin B may be suppressed by prior azole antifungal therapy. As with other azoles, itraconazole inhibits the 14 C-demethylation step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a cell wall component of fungi. Ergosterol is the active site for amphotericin B. In one study the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatus infections in mice was inhibited by ketoconazole therapy. The clinical significance of test results obtained in this study is unknown."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Itraconazole capsules are indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients: 1. Blastomycosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary 2. Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non- meningeal histoplasmosis, and 3. Aspergillosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, in patients who are intolerant of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy. Specimens for fungal cultures and other relevant laboratory studies (wet mount, histopathology, serology) should be obtained before therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, antiinfective therapy should be adjusted accordingly. Itraconazole capsules are also indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients: 1. Onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium), and 2. Onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium). Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing (KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information.) Description of Clinical Studies: Blastomycosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=73 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status. The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 6 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of blastomycosis compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=34 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status (not including HIV-infected patients). The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 12 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of histoplasmosis, compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients: Data from a small number of HIV-infected patients suggested that the response rate of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is similar to that of non-HIV-infected patients. The clinical course of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is more severe and usually requires maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Aspergillosis: Analyses were conducted on data from an open-label, \u201csingle-patient-use\u201d protocol designed to make itraconazole available in the U.S. for patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy (N=190). The findings were corroborated by two smaller open-label studies (N=31 combined) in the same patient population. Most adult patients were treated with a daily dose of 200 to 400 mg, with a median duration of 3 months. Results of these studies demonstrated substantial evidence of effectiveness of itraconazole as a second-line therapy for the treatment of aspergillosis compared with the natural history of the disease in patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy. Onychomycosis of the toenail: Analyses were conducted on data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (N=214 total; 110 given itraconazole capsules in which patients with onychomycosis of the toenails received 200 mg of itraconazole capsules once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Results of these studies demonstrated mycologic cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 54% of patients. Thirty-five percent (35%) of patients were considered an overall success (mycologic cure plus clear or minimal nail involvement with significantly decreased signs) and 14% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure (clearance of all signs, with or without residual nail deformity). The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months. Twenty-one percent (21%) of the overall success group had a relapse (worsening of the global score or conversion of KOH or culture from negative to positive). Onychomycosis of the fingernail: Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N=73 total; 37 given itraconazole capsules in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course (pulse) of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without itraconazole, which was followed by a second 1-week pulse of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent (56%) of patients were considered an overall success and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Congestive Heart Failure: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. (See BOXED WARNINGS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions-Calcium Channel Blockers, ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations.) Drug Interactions: Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole. Some examples of drugs for which plasma concentrations increase are: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride,naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor, finerenone, voclosporin. In addition, coadministration with colchicine, fesoterodine and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, and coadministration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples.) This increase in drug concentrations caused by coadministration with itraconazole may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes , a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Some specific examples are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. Coadministration with venetoclax is contraindicated in patients with CLL/SLL during the dose initiation and ramp-up phase of venetoclax due to the potential for an increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole are contraindicated for patients who have shown hypersensitivity to itraconazole. There is limited information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between itraconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing itraconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hepatic Effects: Itraconazole have been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Continued itraconazole use or reinstitution of treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS.) Cardiac Dysrhythmias: Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with itraconazole and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with itraconazole is contraindicated. (See BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) Cardiac Disease: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. Itraconazole capsules should not be used for other indications in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. For patients with risk factors for congestive heart failure, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of itraconazole therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Such patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF, should be treated with caution, and should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, discontinue administration. Itraconazole has been shown to have a negative inotropic effect. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. Itraconazole has been associated with reports of congestive heart failure. In postmarketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving a total daily dose of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses. Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of itraconazole and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated. Cases of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the postmarketing period among patients being treated for onychomycosis and/or systemic fungal infections. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information.) Pseudoaldosteronism: Pseudoaldosteronism, manifested by the onset of hypertension or worsening of hypertension, and abnormal laboratory findings (hypokalemia, low serum renin and aldosterone, and elevated 11deoxycortisol), has been reported with itraconazole use in the postmarketing setting. Monitor blood pressure and potassium levels and manage as necessary. Management of pseudoaldosteronism may include discontinuation of itraconazole, substitution with an appropriate antifungal drug that is not associated with pseudoaldosteronism, or use of aldosterone receptor antagonists. Interaction Potential: Itraconazole has a potential for clinically important drug interactions. Coadministration of specific drugs with itraconazole may result in changes in efficacy of itraconazole and/or the coadministered drug, life-threatening effects and/or sudden death. Drugs that are contraindicated, not recommended or recommended for use with caution in combination with itraconazole are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. Interchangeability: Itraconazole capsules and itraconazole Oral Solution should not be used interchangeably. This is because drug exposure is greater with the Oral Solution than with the capsules when the same dose of drug is given. In addition, the topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the two formulations. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Itraconazole capsules should be administered after a full meal. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). Hepatotoxicity: Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with itraconazole treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving itraconazole. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction. Neuropathy: If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to itraconazole capsules, the treatment should be discontinued. Immunocompromised Patients: In some immunocompromised patients (e.g., neutropenic, AIDS or organ transplant patients), the oral bioavailability of itraconazole capsules may be decreased. Therefore, the dose should be adjusted based on the clinical response in these patients. Cystic Fibrosis: If a cystic fibrosis patient does not respond to itraconazole capsules, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. For more information concerning the use of itraconazole in cystic fibrosis patients see the prescribing information for itraconazole Oral Solution. Hearing Loss: Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Information for Patients: \u2022 The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the itraconazole capsules and Oral Solution. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole Oral Solution. \u2022 Instruct patients to take itraconazole capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. \u2022 Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. \u2022 Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. \u2022 Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. \u2022 Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. \u2022 Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines. Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, torsade de pointes , respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. Table 1 lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but it is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential, and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole. Some concomitant drugs have the potential to interact with itraconazole resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of itraconazole. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with itraconazole. Decreased concentrations may reduce itraconazole efficacy. Table 2 lists examples of drugs that may affect itraconazole concentrations, but is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 2 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

Miscellaneous Drugs and Other Substances Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor Not recommended 2 weeks before, during, and 2 weeks after itraconazole treatment. a Based on clinical drug interaction information with itraconazole. Pediatric Population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 400 mg/day based on body surface area comparisons). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation ( Drosophila melanogaster ) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 to 160 mg/kg/day (1 to 4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During postmarketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience.) Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants. Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD of 400 mg based on body surface area comparisons). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). HIV-Infected Patients: Because hypochlorhydria has been reported in HIV-infected individuals, the absorption of itraconazole in these patients may be decreased. Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. The exposure of itraconazole may be lower in some patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when itraconazole is administered in this patient population and dose adjustment may be needed. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. It is recommended that patients with impaired hepatic function be carefully monitored when taking itraconazole. It is recommended that the prolonged elimination half-life of itraconazole observed in the single oral dose clinical trial with itraconazole capsules in cirrhotic patients be considered when deciding to initiate therapy with other medications metabolized by CYP3A4. In patients with elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be done in patients with pre-existing hepatic function abnormalities or those who have experienced liver toxicity with other medications. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)"

    "general_precautions": [
      "General: Itraconazole capsules should be administered after a full meal. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). Hepatotoxicity: Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with itraconazole treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving itraconazole. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction. Neuropathy: If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to itraconazole capsules, the treatment should be discontinued. Immunocompromised Patients: In some immunocompromised patients (e.g., neutropenic, AIDS or organ transplant patients), the oral bioavailability of itraconazole capsules may be decreased. Therefore, the dose should be adjusted based on the clinical response in these patients. Cystic Fibrosis: If a cystic fibrosis patient does not respond to itraconazole capsules, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. For more information concerning the use of itraconazole in cystic fibrosis patients see the prescribing information for itraconazole Oral Solution. Hearing Loss: Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients: \u2022 The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the itraconazole capsules and Oral Solution. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole Oral Solution. \u2022 Instruct patients to take itraconazole capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. \u2022 Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. \u2022 Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. \u2022 Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. \u2022 Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. \u2022 Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, torsade de pointes , respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. Table 1 lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but it is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential, and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole. Some concomitant drugs have the potential to interact with itraconazole resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of itraconazole. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with itraconazole. Decreased concentrations may reduce itraconazole efficacy. Table 2 lists examples of drugs that may affect itraconazole concentrations, but is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 2 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 400 mg/day based on body surface area comparisons). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation ( Drosophila melanogaster ) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons)."
    ],
    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 to 160 mg/kg/day (1 to 4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During postmarketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience.)"
    ],
    "nursing_mothers": [
      "Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants."

    "pediatric_use": [
      "Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD of 400 mg based on body surface area comparisons). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats."
    ],
    "geriatric_use": [
      "Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions)."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of itraconazole use should be reassessed. (See WARNINGS: Hepatic Effects and PRECAUTIONS: Hepatotoxicity and Information for Patients.) Adverse Events in the Treatment of Systemic Fungal Infections Adverse event data were derived from 602 patients treated for systemic fungal disease in U.S. clinical trials who were immunocompromised or receiving multiple concomitant medications. Treatment was discontinued in 10.5% of patients due to adverse events. The median duration before discontinuation of therapy was 81 days (range: 2 to 776 days). The table lists adverse events reported by at least 1% of patients.

If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure occur during administration of itraconazole capsules, discontinue administration. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to dogs and healthy human volunteers, negative inotropic effects were seen (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions, ADVERSE REACTIONS : Post-marketing Experience, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations for more information). Drug Interactions: Co-administration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole capsules. Some examples of drugs that are contraindicated for co-administration with itraconazole capsules are: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor, finerenone, voclosporin. Co-administration with colchicine, fesoterodine and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment. Co-administration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors. Co-administration with venetoclax is contraindicated in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) during the dose initiation and ramp-up phase of venetoclax (see PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions Section for specific examples). Co-administration with itraconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS Sections, and PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions Section for specific examples)."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following oral administration. As a consequence of non-linear pharmacokinetics, itraconazole accumulates in plasma during multiple dosing. Steady-state concentrations are generally reached within about 15 days, with C max values of 0.5 mcg/mL, 1.1 mcg/mL and 2 mcg/mL after oral administration of 100 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily and 200 mg b.i.d., respectively. The terminal half-life of itraconazole generally ranges from 16 to 28 hours after single dose and increases to 34 to 42 hours with repeated dosing. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. Itraconazole mean total plasma clearance following intravenous administration is 278 mL/min. Itraconazole clearance decreases at higher doses due to saturable hepatic metabolism. Absorption Itraconazole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following an oral capsule dose. The observed absolute oral bioavailability of itraconazole is about 55%. The oral bioavailability of itraconazole is maximal when itraconazole capsules are taken immediately after a full meal. Absorption of itraconazole capsules is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g., H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Absorption of itraconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when itraconazole capsules are administered with an acidic beverage (such as a non-diet cola). When itraconazole capsules were administered as a single 200-mg dose under fasted conditions with non-diet cola after ranitidine pretreatment, a H 2 -receptor antagonist, itraconazole absorption was comparable to that observed when itraconazole capsules were administered alone (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Itraconazole exposure is lower with the capsule formulation than with the oral solution when the same dose of drug is given (see WARNINGS ). Distribution Most of the itraconazole in plasma is bound to protein (99.8%), with albumin being the main binding component (99.6% for the hydroxy-metabolite). It has also a marked affinity for lipids. Only 0.2% of the itraconazole in plasma is present as free drug. Itraconazole is distributed in a large apparent volume in the body (> 700 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Concentrations in lung, kidney, liver, bone, stomach, spleen and muscle were found to be two to three times higher than corresponding concentrations in plasma, and the uptake into keratinous tissues, skin in particular, up to four times higher. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are much lower than in plasma. Metabolism Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into a large number of metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of itraconazole. The main metabolite is hydroxy-itraconazole, which has in vitro antifungal activity comparable to itraconazole; trough plasma concentrations of this metabolite are about twice those of itraconazole. Excretion Itraconazole is excreted mainly as inactive metabolites in urine (35%) and in feces (54%) within one week of an oral solution dose. Renal excretion of itraconazole and the active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole account for less than 1% of an intravenous dose. Based on an oral radiolabeled dose, fecal excretion of unchanged drug ranges from 3% to 18% of the dose. As re-distribution of itraconazole from keratinous tissues appears to be negligible, elimination of itraconazole from these tissues is related to epidermal regeneration. Contrary to plasma, the concentration in skin persists for 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of a 4-week treatment and in nail keratin \u2013 where itraconazole can be detected as early as 1 week after start of treatment \u2013 for at least six months after the end of a 3-month treatment period. Special Populations: Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. A pharmacokinetic study using a single 200 mg oral dose of itraconazole was conducted in three groups of patients with renal impairment (uremia: n=7; hemodialysis: n=7; and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: n=5). In uremic subjects with a mean creatinine clearance of 13 mL/min. \u00d7 1.73 m 2 , the exposure, based on AUC, was slightly reduced compared with normal population parameters. This study did not demonstrate any significant effect of hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole (T max , C max , and AUC 0 - 8h ). Plasma concentration-versus-time profiles showed wide intersubject variation in all three groups. After a single intravenous dose, the mean terminal half-lives of itraconazole in patients with mild (defined in this study as CrCl 50 mL/min to 79 mL/min), moderate (defined in this study as CrCl 20 mL/min to 49 mL/min), and severe renal impairment (defined in this study as CrCl < 20 mL/min) were similar to that in healthy subjects (range of means 42 to 49 hours vs 48 hours in renally impaired patients and healthy subjects, respectively). Overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was decreased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, as compared with subjects with normal renal function. Data are not available in renally impaired patients during long-term use of itraconazole. Dialysis has no effect on the half-life or clearance of itraconazole or hydroxy-itraconazole (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Impairment: Itraconazole is predominantly metabolized in the liver. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 6 healthy and 12 cirrhotic subjects who were administered a single 100 mg dose of itraconazole as capsule. A statistically significant reduction in mean C max (47%) and a twofold increase in the elimination half-life (37 \u00b1 17 hours vs. 16 \u00b1 5 hours) of itraconazole were noted in cirrhotic subjects compared with healthy subjects. However, overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Data are not available in cirrhotic patients during long-term use of itraconazole (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Decreased Cardiac Contractility: When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, itraconazole should be discontinued (see BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS : Post-marketing Experience for more information). MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action: In vitro studies have demonstrated that itraconazole inhibits the cytochrome P450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. Antimicrobial Activity: Itraconazole exhibits in vitro activity against Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Histoplasma duboisii, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Trichophyton species (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Description of Clinical Studies ). Susceptibility Testing Methods: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC . Resistance: Isolates from several fungal species with decreased susceptibility to itraconazole have been isolated in vitro and from patients receiving prolonged therapy. Itraconazole is not active against Zygomycetes (e.g., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Mucor spp. and Absidia spp.), Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp. Cross-resistance: Several in vitro studies have reported that some fungal clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility to one azole antifungal agent may also be less susceptible to other azole derivatives. The finding of cross-resistance is dependent on a number of factors, including the species evaluated, its clinical history, the particular azole compounds compared, and the type of susceptibility test that is performed. Studies (both in vitro and in vivo ) suggest that the activity of amphotericin B may be suppressed by prior azole antifungal therapy. As with other azoles, itraconazole inhibits the 14 C-demethylation step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a cell wall component of fungi. Ergosterol is the active site for amphotericin B. In one study the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatus infections in mice was inhibited by ketoconazole therapy. The clinical significance of test results obtained in this study is unknown."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Itraconazole capsules are indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients: Blastomycosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non-meningeal histoplasmosis, and Aspergillosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, in patients who are intolerant of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy. Specimens for fungal cultures and other relevant laboratory studies (wet mount, histopathology, serology) should be obtained before therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, antiinfective therapy should be adjusted accordingly. Itraconazole capsules are also indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients: Onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium), and Onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium). Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing (KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and ADVERSE REACTIONS : Post-marketing Experience for more information). Description of Clinical Studies: Blastomycosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=73 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status. The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 6 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of blastomycosis compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=34 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status (not including HIV-infected patients). The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 12 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of histoplasmosis, compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients: Data from a small number of HIV-infected patients suggested that the response rate of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is similar to that of non-HIV-infected patients. The clinical course of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is more severe and usually requires maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Aspergillosis: Analyses were conducted on data from an open-label, \u201csingle-patient-use\u201d protocol designed to make itraconazole available in the U.S. for patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy (N=190). The findings were corroborated by two smaller open-label studies (N=31 combined) in the same patient population. Most adult patients were treated with a daily dose of 200 mg to 400 mg, with a median duration of 3 months. Results of these studies demonstrated substantial evidence of effectiveness of itraconazole as a second-line therapy for the treatment of aspergillosis compared with the natural history of the disease in patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy. Onychomycosis of the toenail: Analyses were conducted on data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (N=214 total; 110 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the toenails received 200 mg of itraconazole capsules once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Results of these studies demonstrated mycologic cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 54% of patients. Thirty-five percent (35%) of patients were considered an overall success (mycologic cure plus clear or minimal nail involvement with significantly decreased signs) and 14% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure (clearance of all signs, with or without residual nail deformity). The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months. Twenty-one percent (21%) of the overall success group had a relapse (worsening of the global score or conversion of KOH or culture from negative to positive). Onychomycosis of the fingernail: Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N=73 total; 37 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course (pulse) of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without itraconazole capsules, which was followed by a second 1-week pulse of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent (56%) of patients were considered an overall success and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Congestive Heart Failure: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF (see BOXED WARNING , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions-Calcium Channel Blockers, ADVERSE REACTIONS : Post-marketing Experience, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations) . Drug Interactions: Co-administration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole. Some examples of drugs for which plasma concentrations increase are: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor, finerenone, voclosporin. In addition, co-administration with colchicine, fesoterodine and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, and co-administration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors (see PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions Section for specific examples). This increase in drug concentrations caused by co-administration with itraconazole may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Some specific examples are listed in PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions. Co-administration with venetoclax is contraindicated in patients with CLL/SLL during the dose initiation and ramp-up phase of venetoclax due to the potential for an increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole capsules are contraindicated for patients who have shown hypersensitivity to itraconazole. There is limited information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between itraconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing itraconazole capsules to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hepatic Effects: Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Continued itraconazole use or reinstitution of treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk (see PRECAUTIONS : Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Cardiac Dysrhythmias: Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with itraconazole and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with itraconazole is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions ). Cardiac Disease: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. Itraconazole capsules should not be used for other indications in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. For patients with risk factors for congestive heart failure, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of itraconazole therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Such patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF, should be treated with caution, and should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, discontinue administration. Itraconazole has been shown to have a negative inotropic effect. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. Itraconazole has been associated with reports of congestive heart failure. In post-marketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving a total daily dose of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses. Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of itraconazole and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated. Cases of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the post-marketing period among patients being treated for onychomycosis and/or systemic fungal infections (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions, and ADVERSE REACTIONS : Post-marketing Experience for more information). Pseudoaldosteronism: Pseudoaldosteronism, manifested by the onset of hypertension or worsening of hypertension, and abnormal laboratory findings (hypokalemia, low serum renin and aldosterone, and elevated 11-deoxycortisol), has been reported with itraconazole use in the post-marketing setting. Monitor blood pressure and potassium levels and manage as necessary. Management of pseudoaldosteronism may include discontinuation of itraconazole, substitution with an appropriate antifungal drug that is not associated with pseudoaldosteronism, or use of aldosterone receptor antagonists. Interaction potential: Itraconazole has a potential for clinically important drug interactions. Co-administration of specific drugs with itraconazole may result in changes in efficacy of itraconazole and/or the co-administered drug, life-threatening effects and/or sudden death. Drugs that are contraindicated, not recommended or recommended for use with caution in combination with itraconazole are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. Interchangeability: Itraconazole capsules and itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably. This is because drug exposure is greater with the oral solution than with the capsules when the same dose of drug is given. In addition, the topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the two formulations. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Itraconazole capsules should be administered after a full meal (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism) . Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism) . Hepatotoxicity: Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with itraconazole treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving itraconazole. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction. Neuropathy: If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to itraconazole capsules, the treatment should be discontinued. Immunocompromised Patients: In some immunocompromised patients (e.g., neutropenic, AIDS or organ transplant patients), the oral bioavailability of itraconazole capsules may be decreased. Therefore, the dose should be adjusted based on the clinical response in these patients. Cystic Fibrosis: If a cystic fibrosis patient does not respond to itraconazole capsules, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. For more information concerning the use of itraconazole in cystic fibrosis patients see the prescribing information for itraconazole oral solution. Hearing Loss: Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING : Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS : Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Information for Patients: The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the itraconazole capsules and oral solution. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole oral solution. Instruct patients to take itraconazole capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines. Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. Table 1 lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but it is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential, and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

Pediatric Population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 400 mg/day based on body surface area comparisons). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation ( Drosophila melanogaster ) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T&frac12; C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 mg/kg/day to 160 mg/kg/day (1 to 4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During post-marketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS : Post-marketing Experience) . Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants. Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD of 400 mg based on body surface area comparisons). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING : Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS : Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions). HIV-Infected Patients: Because hypochlorhydria has been reported in HIV-infected individuals, the absorption of itraconazole in these patients may be decreased. Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. The exposure of itraconazole may be lower in some patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when itraconazole is administered in this patient population and dose adjustment may be needed (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) . Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. It is recommended that patients with impaired hepatic function be carefully monitored when taking itraconazole. It is recommended that the prolonged elimination half-life of itraconazole observed in the single oral dose clinical trial with itraconazole capsules in cirrhotic patients be considered when deciding to initiate therapy with other medications metabolized by CYP3A4. In patients with elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be done in patients with pre-existing hepatic function abnormalities or those who have experienced liver toxicity with other medications (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) ."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of itraconazole use should be reassessed (see WARNINGS : Hepatic Effects and PRECAUTIONS: Hepatotoxicity and Information for Patients). Adverse Events in the Treatment of Systemic Fungal Infections Adverse event data were derived from 602 patients treated for systemic fungal disease in U.S. clinical trials who were immunocompromised or receiving multiple concomitant medications.

If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure occur during administration of itraconazole capsules, discontinue administration. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to dogs and healthy human volunteers, negative inotropic effects were seen. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations for more information.) Drug Interactions: Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole capsules. Some examples of drugs that are contraindicated for coadministration with itraconazole capsules are: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor, finerenone, voclosporin. Coadministration with colchicine, fesoterodine and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment. Coadministration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors. Coadministration with venetoclax is contraindicated in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) during the dose initiation and ramp-up phase of venetoclax. See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples. Coadministration with itraconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia.

      "DESCRIPTION Itraconazole, an azole antifungal agent. Itraconazole is a 1:1:1:1 racemic mixture of four diastereomers (two enantiomeric pairs), each possessing three chiral centers. It may be represented by the following structural formula and nomenclature: (\u00b1)-1-[(R*)-sec-butyl]-4-[p-[4-[p-[[(2R*,4S*)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenyl]-\u0394 2 -1,2,4-triazolin-5-one mixture with (\u00b1)-1-[(R*)-sec-butyl]-4-[p-[4-[p-[[(2S*,4R*)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenyl]-\u0394 2 -1,2,4-triazolin-5-one or (\u00b1)-1-[(RS)-sec-butyl]-4-[p-[4-[p-[[(2R,4S)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenyl]- \u0394 2 -1,2,4-triazolin-5-one Itraconazole has a molecular formula of C 35 H 38 Cl 2 N 8 O 4 and a molecular weight of 705.64. It is a white or almost white powder. Freely soluble in methylene chloride, sparingly soluble in tetrahydrofuran, very slightly soluble in alcohol and practically insoluble in water. It has a pKa of 3.70 (based on extrapolation of values obtained from methanolic solutions) and a log (n-octanol/water) partition coefficient of 5.66 at pH 8.1. Itraconazole capsules contain 100 mg of itraconazole coated on sugar spheres (composed of sucrose, maize starch and purified water). Inactive ingredients are hard gelatin capsule, hypromellose, poloxamer 188, ethanol absolute, methylene chloride, polyethylene glycol 20000, talc, colloidal silicon dioxide, SLS, titanium dioxide, FD&C blue 1, FD&C red 40, FD&C red 3 and white ink (containing: shellac, dehydrated alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, propylene glycol, strong ammonia solution, titanium dioxide and potassium hydroxide).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following oral administration. As a consequence of non-linear pharmacokinetics, itraconazole accumulates in plasma during multiple dosing. Steady-state concentrations are generally reached within about 15 days, with C max values of 0.5 mcg /mL, 1.1 mcg /mL and 2.0 mcg/mL after oral administration of 100 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily and 200 mg b.i.d., respectively. The terminal half-life of itraconazole generally ranges from 16 to 28 hours after single dose and increases to 34 to 42 hours with repeated dosing. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. Itraconazole mean total plasma clearance following intravenous administration is 278 mL/min. Itraconazole clearance decreases at higher doses due to saturable hepatic metabolism. Absorption Itraconazole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following an oral capsule dose. The observed absolute oral bioavailability of itraconazole is about 55%. The oral bioavailability of itraconazole is maximal when itraconazole capsules are taken immediately after a full meal. Absorption of itraconazole capsules is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g., H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) Absorption of itraconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when itraconazole capsules are administered with an acidic beverage (such as a non-diet cola). When itraconazole capsules were administered as a single 200-mg dose under fasted conditions with non-diet cola after ranitidine pretreatment, a H 2 -receptor antagonist, itraconazole absorption was comparable to that observed when itraconazole capsules were administered alone. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) Itraconazole exposure is lower with the Capsule formulation than with the Oral Solution when the same dose of drug is given. (See WARNINGS.) Distribution Most of the itraconazole in plasma is bound to protein (99.8%), with albumin being the main binding component (99.6% for the hydroxy-metabolite). It has also a marked affinity for lipids. Only 0.2% of the itraconazole in plasma is present as free drug. Itraconazole is distributed in a large apparent volume in the body (>700 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Concentrations in lung, kidney, liver, bone, stomach, spleen and muscle were found to be two to three times higher than corresponding concentrations in plasma, and the uptake into keratinous tissues, skin in particular, up to four times higher. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are much lower than in plasma. Metabolism Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into a large number of metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of itraconazole. The main metabolite is hydroxy-itraconazole, which has in vitro antifungal activity comparable to itraconazole; trough plasma concentrations of this metabolite are about twice those of itraconazole. Excretion Itraconazole is excreted mainly as inactive metabolites in urine (35%) and in feces (54%) within one week of an oral solution dose. Renal excretion of itraconazole and the active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole account for less than 1% of an intravenous dose. Based on an oral radiolabeled dose, fecal excretion of unchanged drug ranges from 3% to 18% of the dose. As re-distribution of itraconazole from keratinous tissues appears to be negligible, elimination of itraconazole from these tissues is related to epidermal regeneration. Contrary to plasma, the concentration in skin persists for 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of a 4-week treatment and in nail keratin \u2013 where itraconazole can be detected as early as 1 week after start of treatment \u2013 for at least six months after the end of a 3-month treatment period. Special Populations: Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. A pharmacokinetic study using a single 200 mg oral dose of itraconazole was conducted in three groups of patients with renal impairment (uremia: n=7; hemodialysis: n=7; and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: n=5). In uremic subjects with a mean creatinine clearance of 13mL/min. \u00d7 1.73m 2 , the exposure, based on AUC, was slightly reduced compared with normal population parameters. This study did not demonstrate any significant effect of hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole (T max , C max , and AUC 0-8h ). Plasma concentration-versus- time profiles showed wide intersubject variation in all three groups. After a single intravenous dose, the mean terminal half-lives of itraconazole in patients with mild (defined in this study as CrCl 50 to 79 mL/min), moderate (defined in this study as CrCl 20 to 49 mL/min), and severe renal impairment (defined in this study as CrCl <20 mL/min) were similar to that in healthy subjects (range of means 42 to 49 hours vs 48 hours in renally impaired patients and healthy subjects, respectively). Overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was decreased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, as compared with subjects with normal renal function. Data are not available in renally impaired patients during long-term use of itraconazole. Dialysis has no effect on the half-life or clearance of itraconazole or hydroxy-itraconazole. (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Hepatic Impairment: Itraconazole is predominantly metabolized in the liver. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 6 healthy and 12 cirrhotic subjects who were administered a single 100 mg dose of itraconazole as capsule. A statistically significant reduction in mean C max (47%) and a twofold increase in the elimination half-life (37 \u00b1 17 hours vs. 16 \u00b1 5 hours) of itraconazole were noted in cirrhotic subjects compared with healthy subjects. However, overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Data are not available in cirrhotic patients during long-term use of itraconazole. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Decreased Cardiac Contractility: When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, itraconazole capsules should be discontinued. (See BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS : Postmarketing Experience for more information.) MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action: In vitro studies have demonstrated that itraconazole inhibits the cytochrome P450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. Antimicrobial Activity: Itraconazole exhibits in vitro activity against Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Histoplasma duboisii, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Trichophyton species (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE : Description of Clinical Studies ). Susceptibility Testing Methods: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC. Resistance: Isolates from several fungal species with decreased susceptibility to itraconazole have been isolated in vitro and from patients receiving prolonged therapy. Itraconazole is not active against Zygomycetes (e.g., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Mucor spp. and Absidia spp.), Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp. Cross-Resistance: Several in vitro studies have reported that some fungal clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility to one azole antifungal agent may also be less susceptible to other azole derivatives. The finding of cross-resistance is dependent on a number of factors, including the species evaluated, its clinical history, the particular azole compounds compared, and the type of susceptibility test that is performed. Studies (both in vitro and in vivo) suggest that the activity of amphotericin B may be suppressed by prior azole antifungal therapy. As with other azoles, itraconazole inhibits the 14 C-demethylation step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a cell wall component of fungi. Ergosterol is the active site for amphotericin B. In one study the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatus infections in mice was inhibited by ketoconazole therapy. The clinical significance of test results obtained in this study is unknown."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Itraconazole capsules are indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients: 1. Blastomycosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary 2. Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non-meningeal histoplasmosis, and 3. Aspergillosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, in patients who are intolerant of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy. Specimens for fungal cultures and other relevant laboratory studies (wet mount, histopathology, serology) should be obtained before therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, antiinfective therapy should be adjusted accordingly. Itraconazole capsules are also indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients: 1. Onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium), and 2. Onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium). Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing (KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations , CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information.) Description of Clinical Studies: Blastomycosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=73 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status. The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 6 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of blastomycosis compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=34 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status (not including HIV-infected patients). The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 12 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of histoplasmosis, compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients: Data from a small number of HIV-infected patients suggested that the response rate of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is similar to that of non-HIV-infected patients. The clinical course of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is more severe and usually requires maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Aspergillosis: Analyses were conducted on data from an open-label, \"single-patient-use\" protocol designed to make itraconazole available in the U.S. for patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy (N=190). The findings were corroborated by two smaller open-label studies (N=31 combined) in the same patient population. Most adult patients were treated with a daily dose of 200 to 400 mg, with a median duration of 3 months. Results of these studies demonstrated substantial evidence of effectiveness of itraconazole as a second-line therapy for the treatment of aspergillosis compared with the natural history of the disease in patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy. Onychomycosis of the toenail: Analyses were conducted on data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (N=214 total; 110 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the toenails received 200 mg of itraconazole capsules once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Results of these studies demonstrated mycologic cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 54% of patients. Thirty-five percent (35%) of patients were considered an overall success (mycologic cure plus clear or minimal nail involvement with significantly decreased signs) and 14% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure (clearance of all signs, with or without residual nail deformity). The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months. Twenty-one percent (21%) of the overall success group had a relapse (worsening of the global score or conversion of KOH or culture from negative to positive). Onychomycosis of the fingernail: Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N=73 total; 37 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without itraconazole, which was followed by a second 1-week course of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent (56%) of patients were considered an overall success and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Congestive Heart Failure: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. (See BOXED WARNING , WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions-Calcium Channel Blockers , ADVERSE REACTIONS : Postmarketing Experience , and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations .) Drug Interactions: Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole capsules. Some examples of drugs for which plasma concentrations increase are: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor, finerenone, voclosporin. In addition, coadministration with colchicine, fesoterodine and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, and coadministration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples.) This increase in drug concentrations caused by coadministration with itraconazole may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Some specific examples are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. Coadministration with venetoclax is contraindicated in patients with CLL/SLL during the dose initiation and ramp-up phase of venetoclax due to the potential for an increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole capsules are contraindicated for patients who have shown hypersensitivity to itraconazole. There is limited information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between itraconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing itraconazole capsules to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hepatic Effects: Itraconazole capsules has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Continued itraconazole capsules use or reinstitution of treatment with itraconazole capsules are strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. (See PRECAUTIONS : Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Cardiac Dysrhythmias: Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with itraconazole capsules and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with itraconazole capsules are contraindicated. (See BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions .) Cardiac Disease: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. Itraconazole capsules should not be used for other indications in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. For patients with risk factors for congestive heart failure, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of itraconazole capsules therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Such patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF, should be treated with caution, and should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, discontinue administration. Itraconazole has been shown to have a negative inotropic effect. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. Itraconazole capsules has been associated with reports of congestive heart failure. In postmarketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving a total daily dose of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses. Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of itraconazole capsules and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated. Cases of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the postmarketing period among patients being treated for onychomycosis and/or systemic fungal infections. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations , CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions , and ADVERSE REACTIONS : Postmarketing Experience for more information.) Pseudoaldosteronism: Pseudoaldosteronism, manifested by the onset of hypertension or worsening of hypertension, and abnormal laboratory findings (hypokalemia, low serum renin and aldosterone, and elevated 11 deoxycortisol), has been reported with itraconazole use in the postmarketing setting. Monitor blood pressure and potassium levels and manage as necessary. Management of pseudoaldosteronism may include discontinuation of itraconazole capsules, substitution with an appropriate antifungal drug that is not associated with pseudoaldosteronism, or use of aldosterone receptor antagonists. Interaction Potential: Itraconazole capsules has a potential for clinically important drug interactions. Coadministration of specific drugs with itraconazole may result in changes in efficacy of itraconazole and/or the coadministered drug, life-threatening effects and/or sudden death. Drugs that are contraindicated, not recommended or recommended for use with caution in combination with itraconazole are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. Interchangeability: Itraconazole capsules and itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably. This is because drug exposure is greater with the Oral Solution than with the Capsules when the same dose of drug is given. In addition, the topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the two formulations. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Itraconazole capsules should be administered after a full meal. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Hepatotoxicity: Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with itraconazole capsules treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving itraconazole capsules. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction. Neuropathy: If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to itraconazole capsules, the treatment should be discontinued. Immunocompromised Patients: In some immunocompromised patients (e.g., neutropenic, AIDS or organ transplant patients), the oral bioavailability of itraconazole capsules may be decreased. Therefore, the dose should be adjusted based on the clinical response in these patients. Cystic Fibrosis: If a cystic fibrosis patient does not respond to itraconazole capsules, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. For more information concerning the use of itraconazole in cystic fibrosis patients see the prescribing information for itraconazole oral solution. Hearing Loss: Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING : Drug Interactions , CONTRAINDICATIONS : Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions ). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Information for Patients: \u00b7 The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the itraconazole capsules and oral solution. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole oral solution. \u00b7 Instruct patients to take itraconazole capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. \u00b7 Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole capsules administration, they should discontinue itraconazole capsules and contact their healthcare provider immediately. \u00b7 Instruct patients to stop itraconazole capsules treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. \u00b7 Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. \u00b7 Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. \u00b7 Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines. Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. Table 1 lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but it is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential, and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

Miscellaneous Drugs and Other Substances Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor Not recommended 2 weeks before, during, and 2 weeks after itraconazole treatment. a Based on clinical drug interaction information with itraconazole. Pediatric Population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 400 mg/day based on body surface area comparisons). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli, in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation (Drosophila melanogaster) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 to 160 mg/kg/day (1 to 4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole capsules should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole capsules should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole capsules therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During postmarketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience .) Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole capsules therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants. Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole capsules have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD of 400 mg based on body surface area comparisons). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING : Drug Interactions , CONTRAINDICATIONS : Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions ). HIV-Infected Patients: Because hypochlorhydria has been reported in HIV-infected individuals, the absorption of itraconazole in these patients may be decreased. Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. The exposure of itraconazole may be lower in some patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when itraconazole is administered in this patient population and dose adjustment may be needed. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. It is recommended that patients with impaired hepatic function be carefully monitored when taking itraconazole capsules. It is recommended that the prolonged elimination half-life of itraconazole observed in the single oral dose clinical trial with itraconazole capsules in cirrhotic patients be considered when deciding to initiate therapy with other medications metabolized by CYP3A4. In patients with elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment with itraconazole capsules is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be done in patients with pre-existing hepatic function abnormalities or those who have experienced liver toxicity with other medications.

      "General: Itraconazole capsules should be administered after a full meal. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism )."

      "Information for Patients: \u00b7 The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the itraconazole capsules and oral solution. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole oral solution. \u00b7 Instruct patients to take itraconazole capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. \u00b7 Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole capsules administration, they should discontinue itraconazole capsules and contact their healthcare provider immediately. \u00b7 Instruct patients to stop itraconazole capsules treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. \u00b7 Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. \u00b7 Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. \u00b7 Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. Table 1 lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but it is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential, and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

      "Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 400 mg/day based on body surface area comparisons). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli, in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation (Drosophila melanogaster) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons)."
    ],
    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 to 160 mg/kg/day (1 to 4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole capsules should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole capsules should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole capsules therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During postmarketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience .)"

    "nursing_mothers": [
      "Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole capsules therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants."

      "Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole capsules have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD of 400 mg based on body surface area comparisons). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING : Drug Interactions , CONTRAINDICATIONS : Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions )."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Itraconazole capsules has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of itraconazole capsules use should be reassessed. (See WARNINGS: Hepatic Effects and PRECAUTIONS : Hepatotoxicity and Information for Patients .) Adverse Events in the Treatment of Systemic Fungal Infections Adverse event data were derived from 602 patients treated for systemic fungal disease in U.S. clinical trials who were immunocompromised or receiving multiple concomitant medications. Treatment was discontinued in 10.5% of patients due to adverse events. The median duration before discontinuation of therapy was 81 days (range: 2 to 776 days). The table lists adverse events reported by at least 1% of patients.

      "BOXED WARNING Congestive Heart Failure, Cardiac Effects and Drug Interactions Congestive Heart Failure and Cardiac Effects: If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure occur during administration of itraconazole oral solution, continued itraconazole use should be reassessed . When itraconazole was administered intravenously to dogs and healthy human volunteers, negative inotropic effects were seen (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience , and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations for more information). Drug Interactions: Co-administration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole oral solution. Some examples of drugs that are contraindicated for co-administration with itraconazole oral solution are: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor, finerenone, voclosporin. Co-administration with colchicine, fesoterodine and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment. Co-administration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors. Co-administration with venetoclax is contraindicated in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) during the dose initiation and ramp-up phase of venetoclax (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples). Co-administration with itraconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS Sections, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples)."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Itraconazole General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 2.5 hours following administration of the oral solution. As a consequence of non-linear pharmacokinetics, itraconazole accumulates in plasma during multiple dosing. Steady-state concentrations are generally reached within about 15 days, with C max and AUC values 4 to 7-fold higher than those seen after a single dose. Steady-state C max values of about 2 mcg/mL are reached after oral administration of 200 mg once daily. The terminal half-life of itraconazole generally ranges from 16 to 28 hours after single dose and increases to 34 to 42 hours with repeated dosing. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. Itraconazole mean total plasma clearance following intravenous administration is 278 mL/min. Itraconazole clearance decreases at higher doses due to saturable hepatic metabolism. Absorption Itraconazole is rapidly absorbed after administration of the oral solution. Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2.5 hours following administration of the oral solution under fasting conditions. The observed absolute bioavailability of itraconazole under fed conditions is about 55% and increases by 30% when the oral solution is taken in fasting conditions. Itraconazole exposure is greater with the oral solution than with the capsule formulation when the same dose of drug is given (see WARNINGS ). Distribution Most of the itraconazole in plasma is bound to protein (99.8%), with albumin being the main binding component (99.6% for the hydroxy-metabolite). It has also a marked affinity for lipids. Only 0.2% of the itraconazole in plasma is present as free drug. Itraconazole is distributed in a large apparent volume in the body (> 700 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Concentrations in lung, kidney, liver, bone, stomach, spleen and muscle were found to be two to three times higher than corresponding concentrations in plasma, and the uptake into keratinous tissues, skin in particular, up to four times higher. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are much lower than in plasma. Metabolism Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into a large number of metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of itraconazole. The main metabolite is hydroxy-itraconazole, which has in vitro antifungal activity comparable to itraconazole; trough plasma concentrations of this metabolite are about twice those of itraconazole. Excretion Itraconazole is excreted mainly as inactive metabolites in urine (35%) and in feces (54%) within one week of an oral solution dose. Renal excretion of itraconazole and the active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole account for less than 1% of an intravenous dose. Based on an oral radiolabeled dose, fecal excretion of unchanged drug ranges from 3% to 18% of the dose. Special Populations: Renal Impairment : Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. A pharmacokinetic study using a single 200 mg oral dose of itraconazole was conducted in three groups of patients with renal impairment (uremia: n=7; hemodialysis: n=7; and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: n=5). In uremic subjects with a mean creatinine clearance of 13 mL/min. \u00d7 1.73 m 2 , the exposure, based on AUC, was slightly reduced compared with normal population parameters. This study did not demonstrate any significant effect of hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole (T max , C max , and AUC 0-8h ). Plasma concentration-versus-time profiles showed wide intersubject variation in all three groups. After a single intravenous dose, the mean terminal half-lives of itraconazole in patients with mild (defined in this study as CrCl 50 to 79 mL/min), moderate (defined in this study as CrCl 20 to 49 mL/min), and severe renal impairment (defined in this study as CrCl < 20 mL/min) were similar to that in healthy subjects (range of means 42 to 49 hours vs 48 hours in renally impaired patients and healthy subjects, respectively). Overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was decreased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, as compared with subjects with normal renal function. Data are not available in renally impaired patients during long-term use of itraconazole. Dialysis has no effect on the half-life or clearance of itraconazole or hydroxy-itraconazole (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Impairment : Itraconazole is predominantly metabolized in the liver. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 6 healthy and 12 cirrhotic subjects who were administered a single 100 mg dose of itraconazole as capsule. A statistically significant reduction in mean C max (47%) and a twofold increase in the elimination half-life (37 \u00b1 17 hours vs. 16 \u00b1 5 hours) of itraconazole were noted in cirrhotic subjects compared with healthy subjects. However, overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Data are not available in cirrhotic patients during long-term use of itraconazole (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Decreased Cardiac Contractility : When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure appear during administration of itraconazole oral solution, monitor carefully and consider other treatment alternatives which may include discontinuation of itraconazole oral solution administration (see BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information). Cystic Fibrosis : Seventeen cystic fibrosis patients, ages 7 to 28 years old, were administered itraconazole oral solution 2.5 mg/kg b.i.d. for 14 days in a pharmacokinetic study. Sixteen patients completed the study. Steady-state trough concentrations > 250 ng/mL were achieved in 6 out of 11 patients \u2265 16 years of age but in none of the 5 patients < 16 years of age. Large variability was observed in the pharmacokinetic data (%CV for trough concentrations = 98% and 70% for \u2265 16 and < 16 years, respectively; %CV for AUC = 75% and 58% for \u2265 16 and < 16 years, respectively). If a patient with cystic fibrosis does not respond to itraconazole oral solution, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-Cyclodextrin: The oral bioavailability of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin given as a solubilizer of itraconazole in oral solution is on average lower than 0.5% and is similar to that of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin alone. This low oral bioavailability of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin is not modified by the presence of food and is similar after single and repeated administrations."

    "microbiology": [
      "MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action: In vitro studies have demonstrated that itraconazole inhibits the cytochrome P450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. Antimicrobial Activity: Itraconazole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganism, both in vitro and in clinical infections. Candida albicans Susceptibility Testing Methods: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC . Drug Resistance: Isolates from several fungal species with decreased susceptibility to itraconazole have been isolated in vitro and from patients receiving prolonged therapy. Candida krusei, Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis are generally the least susceptible Candida species, with some isolates showing unequivocal resistance to itraconazole in vitro . Itraconazole is not active against Zygomycetes (e.g., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Mucor spp. and Absidia spp.), Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp. Cross-Resistance: In systemic candidosis, if fluconazole-resistant strains of Candida species are suspected, it cannot be assumed that these are sensitive to itraconazole, hence their sensitivity should be tested before the start of itraconazole therapy. Several in vitro studies have reported that some fungal clinical isolates, including Candida species, with reduced susceptibility to one azole antifungal agent may also be less susceptible to other azole derivatives. The finding of cross-resistance is dependent on a number of factors, including the species evaluated, its clinical history, the particular azole compounds compared, and the type of susceptibility test that is performed. Studies (both in vitro and in vivo ) suggest that the activity of amphotericin B may be suppressed by prior azole antifungal therapy. As with other azoles, itraconazole inhibits the 14 C-demethylation step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a cell wall component of fungi. Ergosterol is the active site for amphotericin B. In one study the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatus infections in mice was inhibited by ketoconazole therapy. The clinical significance of test results obtained in this study is unknown."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Oropharyngeal Candidiasis: Two randomized, controlled studies for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis have been conducted (total n=344). In one trial, clinical response to either 7 or 14 days of itraconazole oral solution, 200 mg/day, was similar to fluconazole tablets and averaged 84% across all arms. Clinical response in this study was defined as cured or improved (only minimal signs and symptoms with no visible lesions). Approximately 5% of subjects were lost to follow-up before any evaluations could be performed. Response to 14 days therapy of itraconazole oral solution was associated with a lower relapse rate than 7 days of itraconazole therapy. In another trial, the clinical response rate (defined as cured or improved) for itraconazole oral solution was similar to clotrimazole troches and averaged approximately 71% across both arms, with approximately 3% of subjects lost to follow-up before any evaluations could be performed. Ninety-two percent of the patients in these studies were HIV seropositive. In an uncontrolled, open-label study of selected patients clinically unresponsive to fluconazole tablets (n=74, all patients HIV seropositive), patients were treated with itraconazole oral solution 100 mg b.i.d. (Clinically unresponsive to fluconazole in this study was defined as having received a dose of fluconazole tablets at least 200 mg/day for a minimum of 14 days.) Treatment duration was 14 to 28 days based on response. Approximately 55% of patients had complete resolution of oral lesions. Of patients who responded and then entered a follow-up phase (n=22), all relapsed within 1 month (median 14 days) when treatment was discontinued. Although baseline endoscopies had not been performed, several patients in this study developed symptoms of esophageal candidiasis while receiving therapy with itraconazole oral solution. Itraconazole oral solution has not been directly compared to other agents in a controlled trial of similar patients. Esophageal Candidiasis: A double-blind randomized study (n=119, 111 of whom were HIV seropositive) compared itraconazole oral solution (100 mg/day) to fluconazole tablets (100 mg/day). The dose of each was increased to 200 mg/day for patients not responding initially. Treatment continued for 2 weeks following resolution of symptoms, for a total duration of treatment of 3 to 8 weeks. Clinical response (a global assessment of cured or improved) was not significantly different between the two study arms, and averaged approximately 86% with 8% lost to follow-up. Six of 53 (11%) itraconazole-treated patients and 12/57 (21%) fluconazole-treated patients were escalated to the 200 mg dose in this trial. Of the subgroup of patients who responded and entered a follow-up phase (n=88), approximately 23% relapsed across both arms within 4 weeks."

Drug Interactions: Co-administration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole. Some examples of drugs for which plasma concentrations increase are: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor, finerenone, voclosporin. In addition, co-administration with colchicine, fesoterodine, and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, and co-administration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples). This increase in drug concentrations caused by co-administration with itraconazole may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Some specific examples are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions . Co-administration with venetoclax is contraindicated in patients with CLL/SLL during the dose initiation and ramp-up phase of venetoclax due to the potential for an increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome.

      "Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. The table below lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but it is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole.

      "WARNINGS Hepatic Effects: Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Continued itraconazole use or reinstitution of treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk (see PRECAUTIONS : Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Cardiac Dysrhythmias: Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with itraconazole and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with itraconazole is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Cardiac Disease: Itraconazole oral solution should not be used in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. For patients with risk factors for congestive heart failure, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of itraconazole therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Such patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF, should be treated with caution, and should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear during administration of itraconazole oral solution, monitor carefully and consider other treatment alternatives which may include discontinuation of itraconazole oral solution administration. Itraconazole has been shown to have a negative inotropic effect. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. Itraconazole has been associated with reports of congestive heart failure. In postmarketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving a total daily dose of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses. Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of itraconazole and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated. Cases of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the postmarketing period among patients being treated for onychomycosis and/or systemic fungal infections (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information). Pseudoaldosteronism: Pseudoaldosteronism, manifested by the onset of hypertension or worsening of hypertension, and abnormal laboratory findings (hypokalemia, low serum renin and aldosterone, and elevated 11-\u00addeoxycortisol), has been reported with itraconazole use in the postmarketing setting. Monitor blood pressure and potassium levels and manage as necessary. Management of pseudoaldosteronism may include discontinuation of itraconazole, substitution with an appropriate antifungal drug that is not associated with pseudoaldosteronism, or use of aldosterone receptor antagonists. Interaction Potential: Itraconazole has a potential for clinically important drug interactions. Co-administration of specific drugs with itraconazole may result in changes in efficacy of itraconazole and/or the co-administered drug, life-threatening effects and/or sudden death. Drugs that are contraindicated, not recommended or recommended for use with caution in combination with itraconazole are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions . Interchangeability: Itraconazole oral solution and itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably. This is because drug exposure is greater with the Oral Solution than with the Capsules when the same dose of drug is given. Only itraconazole oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin: Itraconazole oral solution contains the excipient hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin which produced adenocarcinomas in the large intestine and exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas in a rat carcinogenicity study. These findings were not observed in a similar mouse carcinogenicity study. The clinical relevance of these adenocarcinomas is unknown (see PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility ). Treatment of Severely Neutropenic Patients: Itraconazole oral solution as treatment for oropharyngeal and/or esophageal candidiasis was not investigated in severely neutropenic patients. Due to its pharmacokinetic properties, itraconazole oral solution is not recommended for initiation of treatment in patients at immediate risk of systemic candidiasis."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity: Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with itraconazole treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving itraconazole. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction. Neuropathy: If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to itraconazole oral solution, the treatment should be discontinued. Cystic Fibrosis: If a patient with cystic fibrosis does not respond to itraconazole oral solution, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations ). Hearing Loss: Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Information for Patients: Only itraconazole oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole oral solution contains the excipient hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin which produced adenocarcinomas in the large intestine and exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas in a rat carcinogenicity study. These findings were not observed in a similar mouse carcinogenicity study. The clinical relevance of these adenocarcinomas is unknown (see PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility ). Taking itraconazole oral solution under fasted conditions improves the systemic availability of itraconazole. Instruct patients to take itraconazole oral solution without food, if possible. Itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole capsules. Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines. Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. The table below lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but it is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole.

Pediatric Population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 400 mg/day based on body surface area comparisons). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation ( Drosophila melanogaster ) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T1/2; C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) is the solubilizing excipient used in itraconazole oral solution. Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) was found to produce neoplasms in the large intestine at 5,000 mg/kg/day in rat carcinogenicity study. This dose was about 3 times amount contained in the recommended clinical dose of itraconazole oral solution (16 g) based on body surface area comparisons. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. The slightly higher incidence of adenocarcinomas in the large intestines was linked to the hypertrophic/hyperplastic and inflammatory changes in the colonic mucosa brought about by HP-\u03b2-CD-induced increased osmotic forces. In addition, HP-\u03b2-CD was found to produce pancreatic exocrine hyperplasia and neoplasia when administered orally to rats at doses of 500, 2,000 or 5,000 mg/kg/day for 25 months. Adenocarcinomas of the exocrine pancreas produced in the treated animals were not seen in the untreated group and are not reported in the historical controls. The maximum recommended clinical dose of itraconazole oral solution contains approximately 3.3 times the amount of HP-\u03b2-CD as was in the 500 mg/kg/day dose, based on body surface area comparisons. This finding was not observed in the mouse carcinogenicity study at doses of 500, 2,000 or 5,000 mg/kg/day for 22 to 23 months. This finding was also not observed in a 12-month toxicity study in dogs or in a 2-year toxicity study in female cynomolgus monkeys. Since the development of the pancreatic tumors may be related to a mitogenic action of cholecystokinin and since there is no evidence that cholecystokinin has a mitogenic action in man, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. HP-\u03b2-CD has no antifertile effect, and is not mutagenic. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 to 160 mg/kg/day (1 to 4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. Itraconazole oral solution contains the excipient hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD). HP-\u03b2-CD has no direct embryotoxic and no teratogenic effect. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout Itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During postmarketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience ). Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants. Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD of 400 mg based on body surface area comparisons). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole oral solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole oral solution in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. The exposure of itraconazole may be lower in some patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when itraconazole is administered in this patient population and dose adjustment may be needed (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. It is recommended that patients with impaired hepatic function be carefully monitored when taking itraconazole. It is recommended that the prolonged elimination half-life of itraconazole observed in the single oral dose clinical trial with itraconazole capsules in cirrhotic patients be considered when deciding to initiate therapy with other medications metabolized by CYP3A4. In patients with elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be done in patients with pre-existing hepatic function abnormalities or those who have experienced liver toxicity with other medications (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "Information for Patients: Only itraconazole oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole oral solution contains the excipient hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin which produced adenocarcinomas in the large intestine and exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas in a rat carcinogenicity study. These findings were not observed in a similar mouse carcinogenicity study. The clinical relevance of these adenocarcinomas is unknown (see PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility ). Taking itraconazole oral solution under fasted conditions improves the systemic availability of itraconazole. Instruct patients to take itraconazole oral solution without food, if possible. Itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole capsules. Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 400 mg/day based on body surface area comparisons). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation ( Drosophila melanogaster ) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T1/2; C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons)."

      "Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) is the solubilizing excipient used in itraconazole oral solution. Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) was found to produce neoplasms in the large intestine at 5,000 mg/kg/day in rat carcinogenicity study. This dose was about 3 times amount contained in the recommended clinical dose of itraconazole oral solution (16 g) based on body surface area comparisons. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. The slightly higher incidence of adenocarcinomas in the large intestines was linked to the hypertrophic/hyperplastic and inflammatory changes in the colonic mucosa brought about by HP-\u03b2-CD-induced increased osmotic forces. In addition, HP-\u03b2-CD was found to produce pancreatic exocrine hyperplasia and neoplasia when administered orally to rats at doses of 500, 2,000 or 5,000 mg/kg/day for 25 months. Adenocarcinomas of the exocrine pancreas produced in the treated animals were not seen in the untreated group and are not reported in the historical controls. The maximum recommended clinical dose of itraconazole oral solution contains approximately 3.3 times the amount of HP-\u03b2-CD as was in the 500 mg/kg/day dose, based on body surface area comparisons. This finding was not observed in the mouse carcinogenicity study at doses of 500, 2,000 or 5,000 mg/kg/day for 22 to 23 months. This finding was also not observed in a 12-month toxicity study in dogs or in a 2-year toxicity study in female cynomolgus monkeys. Since the development of the pancreatic tumors may be related to a mitogenic action of cholecystokinin and since there is no evidence that cholecystokinin has a mitogenic action in man, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. HP-\u03b2-CD has no antifertile effect, and is not mutagenic."

      "Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 to 160 mg/kg/day (1 to 4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. Itraconazole oral solution contains the excipient hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD). HP-\u03b2-CD has no direct embryotoxic and no teratogenic effect. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout Itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During postmarketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience )."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of itraconazole use should be reassessed (see WARNINGS: Hepatic Effects and PRECAUTIONS: Hepatotoxicity and Information for Patients ). Adverse Events Reported in Oropharyngeal or Esophageal Candidiasis Trials U.S. adverse experience data are derived from 350 immunocompromised patients (332 HIV seropositive/AIDS) treated for oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis. Table 3 below lists adverse events reported by at least 2% of patients treated with itraconazole oral solution in U.S. clinical trials.

Postmarketing Experience Adverse drug reactions that have been first identified during postmarketing experience with itraconazole (all formulations) are listed in Table 4 below. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, reliably estimating their frequency or establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is not always possible.

      "DESCRIPTION Itraconazole, an azole antifungal agent. Itraconazole is a 1:1:1:1 racemic mixture of four diastereomers (two enantiomeric pairs), each possessing three chiral centers. It may be represented by the following structural formula and nomenclature: (\u00b1)-1-[(R*)-sec-butyl]-4-[p-[4-[p-[[(2R*,4S*)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenyl]-\u0394 2 -1,2,4-triazolin-5-one mixture with (\u00b1)-1-[(R*)-sec-butyl]-4-[p-[4-[p-[[(2S*,4R*)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenyl]-\u0394 2 -1,2,4-triazolin-5-one or (\u00b1)-1-[(RS)-sec-butyl]-4-[p-[4-[p-[[(2R,4S)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenyl]- \u0394 2 -1,2,4-triazolin-5-one Itraconazole has a molecular formula of C 35 H 38 Cl 2 N 8 O 4 and a molecular weight of 705.64. It is a white or almost white powder. Freely soluble in methylene chloride,sparingly soluble in tetrahydrofuran, very slightly soluble in alcohol and practically insoluble in water. It has a pKa of 3.70 (based on extrapolation of values obtained from methanolic solutions) and a log (n-octanol/water) partition coefficient of 5.66 at pH 8.1. Itraconazole capsules contain 100 mg of itraconazole coated on sugar spheres (composed of sucrose, maize starch and purified water). Inactive ingredients are hard gelatin capsule, hypromellose, poloxamer 188, ethanol absolute, methylene chloride, polyethylene glycol 20000, talc, colloidal silicon dioxide, SLS, titanium dioxide, FD&C blue 1, FD&C red 40, FD&C red 3 and white ink (containing: shellac, dehydrated alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, propylene glycol, strong ammonia solution, titanium dioxide and potassium hydroxide).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following oral administration. As a consequence of non-linear pharmacokinetics, itraconazole accumulates in plasma during multiple dosing. Steady-state concentrations are generally reached within about 15 days, with C max values of 0.5 mcg/mL, 1.1 mcg/mL and 2.0 mcg/mL after oral administration of 100 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily and 200 mg b.i.d., respectively. The terminal half-life of itraconazole generally ranges from 16 to 28 hours after single dose and increases to 34 to 42 hours with repeated dosing. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. Itraconazole mean total plasma clearance following intravenous administration is 278 mL/min. Itraconazole clearance decreases at higher doses due to saturable hepatic metabolism. Absorption Itraconazole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following an oral capsule dose. The observed absolute oral bioavailability of itraconazole is about 55%. The oral bioavailability of itraconazole is maximal when itraconazole capsules are taken immediately after a full meal. Absorption of itraconazole capsules is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g., H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions .) Absorption of itraconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when itraconazole capsules are administered with an acidic beverage (such as a non-diet cola). When itraconazole capsules were administered as a single 200-mg dose under fasted conditions with non-diet cola after ranitidine pretreatment, a H 2 -receptor antagonist, itraconazole absorption was comparable to that observed when itraconazole capsules were administered alone. (See PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions .) Itraconazole exposure is lower with the Capsule formulation than with the Oral Solution when the same dose of drug is given. (See WARNINGS ) Distribution Most of the itraconazole in plasma is bound to protein (99.8%), with albumin being the main binding component (99.6% for the hydroxy-metabolite). It has also a marked affinity for lipids. Only 0.2% of the itraconazole in plasma is present as free drug. Itraconazole is distributed in a large apparent volume in the body (>700 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Concentrations in lung, kidney, liver, bone, stomach, spleen and muscle were found to be two to three times higher than corresponding concentrations in plasma, and the uptake into keratinous tissues, skin in particular, up to four times higher. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are much lower than in plasma. Metabolism Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into a large number of metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of itraconazole. The main metabolite is hydroxy-itraconazole, which has in vitro antifungal activity comparable to itraconazole; trough plasma concentrations of this metabolite are about twice those of itraconazole. Excretion Itraconazole is excreted mainly as inactive metabolites in urine (35%) and in feces (54%) within one week of an oral solution dose. Renal excretion of itraconazole and the active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole account for less than 1% of an intravenous dose. Based on an oral radiolabeled dose, fecal excretion of unchanged drug ranges from 3% to 18% of the dose. As re-distribution of itraconazole from keratinous tissues appears to be negligible, elimination of itraconazole from these tissues is related to epidermal regeneration. Contrary to plasma, the concentration in skin persists for 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of a 4-week treatment and in nail keratin \u2013 where itraconazole can be detected as early as 1 week after start of treatment- for at least six months after the end of a 3-month treatment period. Special Populations Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. A pharmacokinetic study using a single 200-mg oral dose of itraconazole was conducted in three groups of patients with renal impairment (uremia: n=7; hemodialysis: n=7; and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: n=5). In uremic subjects with a mean creatinine clearance of 13 mL/min. \u00d7 1.73 m 2 , the exposure, based on AUC, was slightly reduced compared with normal population parameters. This study did not demonstrate any significant effect of hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole (T max , C max , and AUC 0-8 h). Plasma concentration-versus-time profiles showed wide intersubject variation in all three groups. After a single intravenous dose, the mean terminal half-lives of itraconazole in patients with mild (defined in this study as CrCl 50 to 79 mL/min), moderate (defined in this study as CrCl 20 to 49 mL/min), and severe renal impairment (defined in this study as CrCl <20 mL/min) were similar to that in healthy subjects (range of means 42 to 49 hours vs 48 hours in renally impaired patients and healthy subjects, respectively). Overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was decreased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, as compared with subjects with normal renal function. Data are not available in renally impaired patients during long-term use of itraconazole. Dialysis has no effect on the half-life or clearance of itraconazole or hydroxy-itraconazole. (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Hepatic Impairment: Itraconazole is predominantly metabolized in the liver. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 6 healthy and 12 cirrhotic subjects who were administered a single 100-mg dose of itraconazole as capsule. A statistically significant reduction in mean C max (47%) and a twofold increase in the elimination half-life (37 \u00b1 17 hours vs. 16 \u00b1 5 hours) of itraconazole were noted in cirrhotic subjects compared with healthy subjects. However, overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Data are not available in cirrhotic patients during long-term use of itraconazole. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Decreased Cardiac Contractility: When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion,transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, itraconazole capsules should be discontinued. (See BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience for more information.) MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action: In vitro studies have demonstrated that itraconazole inhibits the cytochrome P450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. Antimicrobial Activity : Itraconazole exhibits in vitro activity against Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Histoplasma duboisii, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Trichophyton species (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE : Description of Clinical Studies). Susceptibility Testing Methods: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC. Resistance: Isolates from several fungal species with decreased susceptibility to itraconazole have been isolated in vitro and from patients receiving prolonged therapy. Itraconazole is not active against Zygomycetes (e.g., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Mucor spp. and Absidia spp.), Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp. Cross-resistance: Several in vitro studies have reported that some fungal clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility to one azole antifungal agent may also be less susceptible to other azole derivatives. The finding of cross-resistance is dependent on a number of factors, including the species evaluated, its clinical history, the particular azole compounds compared, and the type of susceptibility test that is performed. Studies (both in vitro and in vivo) suggest that the activity of amphotericin B may be suppressed by prior azole antifungal therapy. As with other azoles, itraconazole inhibits the 14 C-demethylation step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a cell wall component of fungi. Ergosterol is the active site for amphotericin B. In one study the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatus infections in mice was inhibited by ketoconazole therapy. The clinical significance of test results obtained in this study is unknown."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Itraconazole capsules are indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients: 1. Blastomycosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary 2. Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non-meningeal histoplasmosis, and 3. Aspergillosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, in patients who are intolerant of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy. Specimens for fungal cultures and other relevant laboratory studies (wet mount, histopathology, serology) should be obtained before therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, antiinfective therapy should be adjusted accordingly. Itraconazole capsules are also indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients: 1. Onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium), and 2. Onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium). Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing (KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations , CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience for more information.) Description of Clinical Studies: Blastomycosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=73 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status. The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 6 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of blastomycosis compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=34 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status (not including HIV-infected patients). The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 12 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of histoplasmosis, compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients: Data from a small number of HIV-infected patients suggested that the response rate of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is similar to that of non-HIV-infected patients. The clinical course of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is more severe and usually requires maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Aspergillosis: Analyses were conducted on data from an open-label, \"single-patient-use\" protocol designed to make itraconazole available in the U.S. for patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy (N=190). The findings were corroborated by two smaller open-label studies (N=31 combined) in the same patient population. Most adult patients were treated with a daily dose of 200 to 400 mg, with a median duration of 3 months. Results of these studies demonstrated substantial evidence of effectiveness of itraconazole as a second-line therapy for the treatment of aspergillosis compared with the natural history of the disease in patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy. Onychomycosis of the toenail: Analyses were conducted on data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (N=214 total;110 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the toenails received 200 mg of itraconazole capsules once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Results of these studies demonstrated mycologic cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 54% of patients. Thirty-five percent (35%) of patients were considered an overall success (mycologic cure plus clear or minimal nail involvement with significantly decreased signs) and 14% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure (clearance of all signs, with or without residual nail deformity). The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months. Twenty-one percent (21%) of the overall success group had a relapse (worsening of the global score or conversion of KOH or culture from negative to positive). Onychomycosis of the fingernail: Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N=73 total; 37 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without itraconazole, which was followed by a second 1-week course of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent (56%) of patients were considered an overall success and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Congestive Heart Failure Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. (See BOXED WARNING , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions -Calcium Channel Blockers, ADVERSE REACTIONS : Post-marketing Experience, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations.) Drug Interactions Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole capsules. Plasma concentrations increase for the following drugs: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor. In addition, coadministration with colchicine, fesoterodine and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, and coadministration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors. (See PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions Section for specific examples.) This increase in drug concentrations caused by coadministration with itraconazole may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Specific examples are listed in PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions. Coadministration with venetoclax is contraindicated in patients with CLL/SLL during the dose initiation and ramp-up phase of venetoclax due to the potential for an increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole capsules are contraindicated for patients who have shown hypersensitivity to itraconazole. There is limited information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between itraconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing itraconazole capsules to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hepatic Effects Itraconazole capsules has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Continued itraconazole capsules use or reinstitution of treatment with itraconazole capsules are strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. (See PRECAUTIONS : Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Cardiac Dysrhythmias Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with itraconazole capsules and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with itraconazole capsules are contraindicated. (See BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions .) Cardiac Disease Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. Itraconazole capsules should not be used for other indications in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. For patients with risk factors for congestive heart failure, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of itraconazole capsules therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Such patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF, should be treated with caution, and should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, discontinue administration. Itraconazole has been shown to have a negative inotropic effect. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. Itraconazole capsules has been associated with reports of congestive heart failure. In post-marketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving a total daily dose of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses. Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of itraconazole capsules and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated. Cases of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the post-marketing period among patients being treated for onychomycosis and/or systemic fungal infections. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations , CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions , and ADVERSE REACTIONS : Post-marketing Experience for more information.) Interaction potential: Itraconazole capsules has a potential for clinically important drug interactions. Coadministration of specific drugs with itraconazole may result in changes in efficacy of itraconazole and/or the coadministered drug, life-threatening effects and/or sudden death. Drugs that are contraindicated, not recommended or recommended for use with caution in combination with itraconazole are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. Interchangeability: Itraconazole capsules and itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably. This is because drug exposure is greater with the Oral Solution than with the Capsules when the same dose of drug is given. In addition, the topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the two formulations. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Itraconazole capsules should be administered after a full meal. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Hepatotoxicity: Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with itraconazole capsules treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving itraconazole capsules. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction. Neuropathy: If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to itraconazole capsules, the treatment should be discontinued. Immunocompromised Patients: In some immunocompromised patients (e.g., neutropenic, AIDS or organ transplant patients), the oral bioavailability of itraconazole capsules may be decreased. Therefore, the dose should be adjusted based on the clinical response in these patients. Cystic Fibrosis: If a cystic fibrosis patient does not respond to itraconazole capsules, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. For more information concerning the use of itraconazole in cystic fibrosis patients see the prescribing information for itraconazole oral solution. Hearing Loss: Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING : Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS : Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Information for Patients: \u00b7 The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the itraconazole capsules and oral solution. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole oral solution. \u00b7 Instruct patients to take itraconazole capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. \u00b7 Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole capsules administration, they should discontinue itraconazole capsules and contact their healthcare provider immediately. \u00b7 Instruct patients to stop itraconazole capsules treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. \u00b7 Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. \u00b7 Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. \u00b7 Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines. Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes , respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. Table 1 lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential, and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

Pediatric Population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day(approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (3.1 times the MRHD) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (6.25 times the MRHD) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli, in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation (Drosophila melanogaster) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (20 times the MRHD). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 to 160 mg/kg/day (5 to 20 times the MRHD), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole capsules should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole capsules should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole capsules therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During post-marketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience .) Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole capsules therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants. Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole capsules have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the MRHD). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (20 times the MRHD) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING : Drug Interactions , CONTRAINDICATIONS : Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). HIV-Infected Patients: Because hypochlorhydria has been reported in HIV-infected individuals, the absorption of itraconazole in these patients may be decreased. Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. The exposure of itraconazole may be lower in some patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when itraconazole is administered in this patient population and dose adjustment may be needed. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. It is recommended that patients with impaired hepatic function be carefully monitored when taking itraconazole capsules. It is recommended that the prolonged elimination half-life of itraconazole observed in the single oral dose clinical trial with itraconazole capsules in cirrhotic patients be considered when deciding to initiate therapy with other medications metabolized by CYP3A4. In patients with elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment with itraconazole capsules is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be done in patients with pre-existing hepatic function abnormalities or those who have experienced liver toxicity with other medications.

      "General Itraconazole capsules should be administered after a full meal. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism )."

      "Information for Patients: \u00b7 The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the itraconazole capsules and oral solution. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole oral solution. \u00b7 Instruct patients to take itraconazole capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. \u00b7 Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole capsules administration, they should discontinue itraconazole capsules and contact their healthcare provider immediately. \u00b7 Instruct patients to stop itraconazole capsules treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. \u00b7 Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. \u00b7 Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. \u00b7 Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes , respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. Table 1 lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential, and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day(approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (3.1 times the MRHD) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (6.25 times the MRHD) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli, in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation (Drosophila melanogaster) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (20 times the MRHD)."
    ],
    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 to 160 mg/kg/day (5 to 20 times the MRHD), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole capsules should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole capsules should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole capsules therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During post-marketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience .)"
    ],
    "nursing_mothers": [
      "Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole capsules therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants."

    "pediatric_use": [
      "Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole capsules have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the MRHD). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (20 times the MRHD) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats."
    ],
    "geriatric_use": [
      "Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING : Drug Interactions , CONTRAINDICATIONS : Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Itraconazole capsules has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of itraconazole capsules use should be reassessed. (See WARNINGS: Hepatic Effects and PRECAUTIONS : Hepatotoxicity and Information for Patients .) Adverse Events in the Treatment of Systemic Fungal Infections Adverse event data were derived from 602 patients treated for systemic fungal disease in U.S. clinical trials who were immunocompromised or receiving multiple concomitant medications. Treatment was discontinued in 10.5% of patients due to adverse events. The median duration before discontinuation of therapy was 81 days (range: 2 to 776 days).

      "DESCRIPTION Itraconazole, an azole antifungal agent. Itraconazole is a 1:1:1:1 racemic mixture of four diastereomers (two enantiomeric pairs), each possessing three chiral centers. It may be represented by the following structural formula and nomenclature: (\u00b1)-1-sec-Butyl-4-[p-[4-[p-[[2R * ,4S * )-2-(2,4-dichloro phenyl)-2-(1H-1, 2, 4-triazol-1 ylmethyl)-1,3- dioxolan-4 yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenyl]- \u0394 2 -1, 2, 4-triazolin-5- one or 4-[4-[4-[4-[[Cis-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4- triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4 yl]methoxy] phenyl]piperazin-1-yl] phenyl]-2-[(1RS)-1-methyl propyl]-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one Itraconazole has a molecular formula of C 35 H 38 Cl 2 N 8 O 4 and a molecular weight of 705.63. It is a white or almost white powder. It is freely soluble in methylene chloride, sparingly soluble in tetrahydrofuran, very slightly soluble in alcohol, practically insoluble in water. It has a pKa of 3.70 (based on extrapolation of values obtained from methanolic solutions) and a log (n-octanol/ aq. Buffer of pH: 8.1) partition coefficient of 5.66 at pH 8.1. Itraconazole oral solution contains 10 mg of itraconazole USP per mL, solubilized by hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (400 mg/mL) as a molecular inclusion complex. Itraconazole oral solution is clear, colorless to yellowish brown liquid with a target pH of 2. Other ingredients are ascorbic acid, hydrochloric acid, propylene glycol, purified water, non crystallizing sorbitol solution, saccharin sodium, sodium hydroxide, ART Cherry flavor. structute"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Itraconazole General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 2.5 hours following administration of the oral solution. As a consequence of non-linear pharmacokinetics, itraconazole accumulates in plasma during multiple dosing. Steady-state concentrations are generally reached within about 15 days, with C max and AUC values 4 to 7-fold higher than those seen after a single dose. Steady-state C max values of about 2 mcg/mL are reached after oral administration of 200 mg once daily. The terminal half-life of itraconazole generally ranges from 16 to 28 hours after single dose and increases to 34 to 42 hours with repeated dosing. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. Itraconazole mean total plasma clearance following intravenous administration is 278 mL/min. Itraconazole clearance decreases at higher doses due to saturable hepatic metabolism. Absorption Itraconazole is rapidly absorbed after administration of the oral solution. Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2.5 hours following administration of the oral solution under fasting conditions. The observed absolute bioavailability of itraconazole under fed conditions is about 55% and increases by 30% when the oral solution is taken in fasting conditions. Itraconazole exposure is greater with the oral solution than with the capsule formulation when the same dose of drug is given. (see WARNINGS ) Distribution Most of the itraconazole in plasma is bound to protein (99.8%), with albumin being the main binding component (99.6% for the hydroxy-metabolite). It has also a marked affinity for lipids. Only 0.2% of the itraconazole in plasma is present as free drug. Itraconazole is distributed in a large apparent volume in the body (>700 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Concentrations in lung, kidney, liver, bone, stomach, spleen and muscle were found to be two to three times higher than corresponding concentrations in plasma, and the uptake into keratinous tissues, skin in particular, up to four times higher. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are much lower than in plasma. Metabolism Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into a large number of metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of itraconazole. The main metabolite is hydroxy-itraconazole, which has in vitro antifungal activity comparable to itraconazole; trough plasma concentrations of this metabolite are about twice those of itraconazole. Excretion Itraconazole is excreted mainly as inactive metabolites in urine (35%) and in feces (54%) within one week of an oral solution dose. Renal excretion of itraconazole and the active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole account for less than 1% of an intravenous dose. Based on an oral radiolabeled dose, fecal excretion of unchanged drug ranges from 3% to 18% of the dose. Special Populations: Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. A pharmacokinetic study using a single 200 mg oral dose of itraconazole was conducted in three groups of patients with renal impairment (uremia: n = 7; hemodialysis: n = 7; and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: n = 5). In uremic subjects with a mean creatinine clearance of 13 mL/min.\u00d71.73 m 2 , the exposure, based on AUC, was slightly reduced compared with normal population parameters. This study did not demonstrate any significant effect of hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole (T max , C max , and AUC 0 to 8h ). Plasma concentration-versus-time profiles showed wide intersubject variation in all three groups. After a single intravenous dose, the mean terminal half-lives of itraconazole in patients with mild (defined in this study as CrCl 50 to 79 mL/min), moderate (defined in this study as CrCl 20 to 49 mL/min), and severe renal impairment (defined in this study as CrCl <20 mL/min) were similar to that in healthy subjects (range of means 42 to 49 hours vs 48 hours in renally impaired patients and healthy subjects, respectively). Overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was decreased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, as compared with subjects with normal renal function. Data are not available in renally impaired patients during long-term use of itraconazole. Dialysis has no effect on the half-life or clearance of itraconazole or hydroxy-itraconazole. (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Hepatic Impairment: Itraconazole is predominantly metabolized in the liver. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 6 healthy and 12 cirrhotic subjects who were administered a single 100 mg dose of itraconazole as capsule. A statistically significant reduction in mean C max (47%) and a two fold increase in the elimination half-life (37 \u00b1 17 hours vs. 16 \u00b1 5 hours) of itraconazole were noted in cirrhotic subjects compared with healthy subjects. However, overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Data are not available in cirrhotic patients during long-term use of itraconazole. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Decreased Cardiac Contractility: When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure appear during administration of itraconazole oral solution, monitor carefully and consider other treatment alternatives which may include discontinuation of itraconazole oral solution administration. (See BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS : Postmarketing Experience for more information.) Cystic Fibrosis: Seventeen cystic fibrosis patients, ages 7 to 28 years old, were administered itraconazole oral solution 2.5 mg/kg b.i.d. for 14 days in a pharmacokinetic study. Sixteen patients completed the study. Steady state trough concentrations >250 ng/mL were achieved in 6 out of 11 patients \u226516 years of age but in none of the 5 patients <16 years of age. Large variability was observed in the pharmacokinetic data (%CV for trough concentrations = 98% and 70% for \u226516 and <16 years, respectively; %CV for AUC = 75% and 58% for \u226516 and <16 years, respectively). If a patient with cystic fibrosis does not respond to itraconazole oral solution, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. Hydroxypropyl-\u00df-Cyclodextrin: The oral bioavailability of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin given as a solubilizer of itraconazole in oral solution is on average lower than 0.5% and is similar to that of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin alone. This low oral bioavailability of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin is not modified by the presence of food and is similar after single and repeated administrations."

    "microbiology": [
      "MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action: In vitro studies have demonstrated that itraconazole inhibits the cytochrome P450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. Antimicrobial Activity: Itraconazole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganism, both in vitro and in clinical infections. Candida albicans Susceptibility Testing Methods: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC. Drug Resistance: Isolates from several fungal species with decreased susceptibility to itraconazole have been isolated in vitro and from patients receiving prolonged therapy. Candida krusei, Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis are generally the least susceptible Candida species, with some isolates showing unequivocal resistance to itraconazole in vitro . Itraconazole is not active against Zygomycetes (e.g., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Mucor spp. and Absidia spp.), Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp. Cross-Resistance: In systemic candidosis, if fluconazole-resistant strains of Candida species are suspected, it cannot be assumed that these are sensitive to itraconazole, hence their sensitivity should be tested before the start of itraconazole therapy. Several in vitro studies have reported that some fungal clinical isolates, including Candida species, with reduced susceptibility to one azole antifungal agent may also be less susceptible to other azole derivatives. The finding of cross-resistance is dependent on a number of factors, including the species evaluated, its clinical history, the particular azole compounds compared, and the type of susceptibility test that is performed. Studies (both in vitro and in vivo ) suggest that the activity of amphotericin B may be suppressed by prior azole antifungal therapy. As with other azoles, itraconazole inhibits the 14 C-demethylation step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a cell wall component of fungi. Ergosterol is the active site for amphotericin B. In one study the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatus infections in mice was inhibited by ketoconazole therapy. The clinical significance of test results obtained in this study is unknown."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Oropharyngeal Candidiasis: Two randomized, controlled studies for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis have been conducted (total n = 344). In one trial, clinical response to either 7 or 14 days of itraconazole oral solution, 200 mg/day, was similar to fluconazole tablets and averaged 84% across all arms. Clinical response in this study was defined as cured or improved (only minimal signs and symptoms with no visible lesions). Approximately 5% of subjects were lost to follow-up before any evaluations could be performed. Response to 14 days therapy of itraconazole oral solution was associated with a lower relapse rate than 7 days of itraconazole therapy. In another trial, the clinical response rate (defined as cured or improved) for itraconazole oral solution was similar to clotrimazole troches and averaged approximately 71% across both arms, with approximately 3% of subjects lost to follow-up before any evaluations could be performed. Ninety-two percent of the patients in these studies were HIV seropositive. In an uncontrolled, open-label study of selected patients clinically unresponsive to fluconazole tablets (n = 74, all patients HIV seropositive), patients were treated with itraconazole oral solution 100 mg b.i.d. (Clinically unresponsive to fluconazole in this study was defined as having received a dose of fluconazole tablets at least 200 mg/day for a minimum of 14 days.) Treatment duration was 14 to 28 days based on response. Approximately 55% of patients had complete resolution of oral lesions. Of patients who responded and then entered a follow-up phase (n = 22), all relapsed within 1 month (median 14 days) when treatment was discontinued. Although baseline endoscopies had not been performed, several patients in this study developed symptoms of esophageal candidiasis while receiving therapy with itraconazole oral solution. Itraconazole oral solution has not been directly compared to other agents in a controlled trial of similar patients. Esophageal Candidiasis: A double-blind randomized study (n = 119, 111 of whom were HIV seropositive) compared itraconazole oral solution (100 mg/day) to fluconazole tablets (100 mg/day). The dose of each was increased to 200 mg/day for patients not responding initially. Treatment continued for 2 weeks following resolution of symptoms, for a total duration of treatment of 3 to 8 weeks. Clinical response (a global assessment of cured or improved) was not significantly different between the two study arms, and averaged approximately 86% with 8% lost to follow-up. Six of 53 (11%) itraconazole-treated patients and 12/57 (21%) fluconazole-treated patients were escalated to the 200 mg dose in this trial. Of the subgroup of patients who responded and entered a follow-up phase (n = 88), approximately 23% relapsed across both arms within 4 weeks."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Congestive Heart Failure: Itraconazole oral solution should not be administered to patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF except for the treatment of life-threatening or other serious infections. (See BOXED WARNING , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions-Calcium Channel Blockers, ADVERSE REACTIONS : Postmarketing Experience, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations.) Drug Interactions: Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole. Some examples of drugs for which plasma concentrations increase are: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor, finerenone, voclosporin. In addition, coadministration with colchicine, fesoterodine, and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, and coadministration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors. (See PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions Section for specific examples.) This increase in drug concentrations caused by coadministration with itraconazole may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Some specific examples are listed in PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions. Coadministration with venetoclax is contraindicated in patients with CLL/SLL during the dose initiation and ramp-up phase of venetoclax due to the potential for an increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Itraconazole is contraindicated for patients who have shown hypersensitivity to itraconazole. There is limited information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between itraconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing itraconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hepatic Effects: Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Continued itraconazole use or reinstitution of treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. (See PRECAUTIONS : Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Cardiac Dysrhythmias: Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with itraconazole and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with itraconazole oral solution is contraindicated. (See BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions.) Cardiac Disease: Itraconazole oral solution should not be used in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. For patients with risk factors for congestive heart failure, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of itraconazole therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Such patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF, should be treated with caution, and should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear during administration of itraconazole oral solution, monitor carefully and consider other treatment alternatives which may include discontinuation of itraconazole oral solution administration. Itraconazole has been shown to have a negative inotropic effect. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. Itraconazole oral solution has been associated with reports of congestive heart failure. In postmarketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving a total daily dose of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses. Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of itraconazole and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated. Cases of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the postmarketing period among patients being treated for onychomycosis and/or systemic fungal infections. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations, PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions, and ADVERSE REACTIONS : Postmarketing Experience for more information.) Pseudoaldosteronism: Pseudoaldosteronism, manifested by the onset of hypertension or worsening of hypertension, and abnormal laboratory findings (hypokalemia, low serum renin and aldosterone, and elevated 11\u00ad-deoxycortisol), has been reported with itraconazole use in the postmarketing setting. Monitor blood pressure and potassium levels and manage as necessary. Management of pseudoaldosteronism may include discontinuation of itraconazole, substitution with an appropriate antifungal drug that is not associated with pseudoaldosteronism, or use of aldosterone receptor antagonists. Interaction Potential: Itraconazole has a potential for clinically important drug interactions. Coadministration of specific drugs with itraconazole may result in changes in efficacy of itraconazole and/or the coadministered drug, life-threatening effects and/or sudden death. Drugs that are contraindicated, not recommended or recommended for use with caution in combination with itraconazole are listed in PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions. Interchangeability: Itraconazole oral solution and itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably. This is because drug exposure is greater with the oral solution than with the capsules when the same dose of drug is given. Only itraconazole oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin: Itraconazole oral solution contains the excipient hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin which produced adenocarcinomas in the large intestine and exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas in a rat carcinogenicity study. These findings were not observed in a similar mouse carcinogenicity study. The clinical relevance of these adenocarcinomas is unknown. (See PRECAUTIONS : Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility.) Treatment of Severely Neutropenic Patients: Itraconazole oral solution as treatment for oropharyngeal and/or esophageal candidiasis was not investigated in severely neutropenic patients. Due to its pharmacokinetic properties, itraconazole oral solution is not recommended for initiation of treatment in patients at immediate risk of systemic candidiasis."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity: Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with itraconazole treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving itraconazole. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction. Neuropathy: If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to itraconazole oral solution, the treatment should be discontinued. Cystic Fibrosis: If a patient with cystic fibrosis does not respond to itraconazole oral solution, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations). Hearing Loss: Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING : Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS : Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Information for Patients: \u2022 Only itraconazole oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. \u2022 Itraconazole oral solution contains the excipient hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin which produced adenocarcinomas in the large intestine and exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas in a rat carcinogenicity study. These findings were not observed in a similar mouse carcinogenicity study. The clinical relevance of these adenocarcinomas is unknown. (See PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility.) \u2022 Taking itraconazole oral solution under fasted conditions improves the systemic availability of itraconazole. Instruct patients to take itraconazole oral solution without food, if possible. \u2022 Itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole capsules. \u2022 Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. \u2022 Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. \u2022 Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. \u2022 Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. \u2022 Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines. Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, t orsade de pointes, respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. The table below lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but it is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 below are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole. Some concomitant drugs have the potential to interact with itraconazole resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of itraconazole. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with itraconazole. Decreased concentrations may reduce itraconazole efficacy. The table below lists examples of drugs that may affect itraconazole concentrations, but it is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 2 below are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

Pediatric Population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 400 mg/day based on body surface area comparisons). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli, in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation ( Drosophila melanogaster ) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) is the solubilizing excipient used in itraconazole oral solution. Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) was found to produce neoplasms in the large intestine at 5,000 mg/kg/day in rat carcinogenicity study. This dose was about 3 times amount contained in the recommended clinical dose of itraconazole oral solution (16 g) based on body surface area comparisons. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. The slightly higher incidence of adenocarcinomas in the large intestines was linked to the hypertrophic/hyperplastic and inflammatory changes in the colonic mucosa brought about by HP-\u03b2-CD-induced increased osmotic forces. In addition, HP-\u03b2-CD was found to produce pancreatic exocrine hyperplasia and neoplasia when administered orally to rats at doses of 500, 2,000 or 5,000 mg/kg/day for 25 months. Adenocarcinomas of the exocrine pancreas produced in the treated animals were not seen in the untreated group and are not reported in the historical controls. The maximum recommended clinical dose of itraconazole oral solution contains approximately 3.3 times the amount of HP-\u03b2-CD as was in the 500 mg/kg/day dose, based on body surface area comparisons. This finding was not observed in the mouse carcinogenicity study at doses of 500, 2,000 or 5,000 mg/kg/day for 22 to 23 months. This finding was also not observed in a 12-month toxicity study in dogs or in a 2-year toxicity study in female cynomolgus monkeys. Since the development of the pancreatic tumors may be related to a mitogenic action of cholecystokinin and since there is no evidence that cholecystokinin has a mitogenic action in man, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. HP-\u03b2-CD has no antifertile effect, and is not mutagenic. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 to 160 mg/kg/day (1 to 4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. Itraconazole oral solution contains the excipient hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD). HP-\u03b2-CD has no direct embryotoxic and no teratogenic effect. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During postmarketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS : Postmarketing Experience.) Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants. Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD of 400 mg based on body surface area comparisons). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole oral solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole oral solution in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING : Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS : Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions). Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. The exposure of itraconazole may be lower in some patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when itraconazole is administered in this patient population and dose adjustment may be needed. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. It is recommended that patients with impaired hepatic function be carefully monitored when taking itraconazole. It is recommended that the prolonged elimination half-life of itraconazole observed in the single oral dose clinical trial with itraconazole capsules in cirrhotic patients be considered when deciding to initiate therapy with other medications metabolized by CYP3A4. In patients with elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be done in patients with pre-existing hepatic function abnormalities or those who have experienced liver toxicity with other medications.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of itraconazole use should be reassessed. (See WARNINGS : Hepatic Effects and PRECAUTIONS : Hepatotoxicity and Information for Patients.) Adverse Events Reported in Oropharyngeal or Esophageal Candidiasis Trials U.S. adverse experience data are derived from 350 immunocompromised patients (332 HIV seropositive/AIDS) treated for oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis. Table 3 below lists adverse events reported by at least 2% of patients treated with itraconazole oral solution in U.S. clinical trials. Data on patients receiving comparator agents in these trials are included for comparison. Table 3: Summary of Adverse Events Reported by \u22652% of Itraconazole Treated Patients in U.S. Clinical Trials (Total) Body System/ Adverse Event Itraconazole Total (n = 350*) % All controlled studies (n = 272) % Fluconazole (n = 125 \u2020 ) % Clotrimazole (n = 81 \u2021 ) % Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea Diarrhea Vomiting Abdominal pain Constipation 11 11 7 6 2 10 10 6 4 2 11 10 8 7 1 5 4 1 7 0 Body as a whole Fever Chest pain Pain Fatigue 7 3 2 2 6 3 2 1 8 2 4 2 5 0 0 0 Respiratory disorders Coughing Dyspnea Pneumonia Sinusitis Sputum increased 4 2 2 2 2 4 3 2 2 3 10 5 0 4 3 0 1 0 0 1 Skin and appendages disorders Rash Increased sweating Skin disorder unspecified 4 3 2 5 4 2 4 6 2 6 1 1 Central/peripheral nervous system Headache Dizziness 4 2 4 2 6 4 6 1 Resistance mechanism disorders Pneumocystis carinii infection 2 2 2 0 Psychiatric disorders Depression 2 1 0 1 * Of the 350 patients, 209 were treated for oropharyngeal candidiasis in controlled studies, 63 were treated for esophageal candidiasis in controlled studies and 78 were treated for oropharyngeal candidiasis in an open study. \u2020 Of the 125 patients, 62 were treated for oropharyngeal candidiasis and 63 were treated for esophageal candidiasis. \u2021 All 81 patients were treated for oropharyngeal candidiasis. Adverse events reported by less than 2% of patients in U.S. clinical trials with itraconazole included: adrenal insufficiency, asthenia, back pain, dehydration, dyspepsia, dysphagia, flatulence, gynecomastia, hematuria, hemorrhoids, hot flushes, implantation complication, infection unspecified, injury, insomnia, male breast pain, myalgia, pharyngitis, pruritus, rhinitis, rigors, stomatitis ulcerative, taste perversion, tinnitus, upper respiratory tract infection, vision abnormal, and weight decrease. Edema, hypokalemia and menstrual disorders have been reported in clinical trials with itraconazole capsules. Adverse Events Reported from Other Clinical Trials A comparative clinical trial in patients who received intravenous itraconazole followed by itraconazole oral solution or received Amphotericin B reported the following adverse events in the itraconazole intravenous/itraconazole oral solution treatment arm which are not listed above in the subsection \u201cAdverse Events Reported in Oropharyngeal or Esophageal Candidiasis Trials\u201d or listed below as postmarketing reports of adverse drug reactions: serum creatinine increased, blood urea nitrogen increased, renal function abnormal, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, hypotension, tachycardia and pulmonary infiltration. In addition, the following adverse drug reactions were reported in patients who participated in itraconazole oral solution clinical trials: Cardiac Disorders : cardiac failure; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: edema; Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatic failure, hyperbilirubinemia; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: hypokalemia; Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: menstrual disorder The following is a list of additional adverse drug reactions associated with itraconazole that have been reported in clinical trials of itraconazole capsules and itraconazole IV excluding the adverse reaction term \u201cInjection site inflammation\u201d which is specific to the injection route of administration: Cardiac Disorders: left ventricular failure; Gastrointestinal Disorders: gastrointestinal disorder; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: face edema; Hepatobiliary Disorders: jaundice, hepatic function abnormal; Investigations: alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, urine analysis abnormal; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia; Nervous System Disorders: somnolence; Psychiatric Disorders: confusional state; Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal impairment; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: dysphonia; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash erythematous; Vascular Disorders: hypertension In addition, the following adverse drug reaction was reported in children only who participated in itraconazole oral solution clinical trials: mucosal inflammation. Postmarketing Experience Adverse drug reactions that have been first identified during postmarketing experience with itraconazole (all formulations) are listed in Table 4 below. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, reliably estimating their frequency or establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is not always possible. Table 4: Postmarketing Reports of Adverse Drug Reactions Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia Immune System Disorders: Anaphylaxis; anaphylactic, anaphylactoid and allergic reactions; serum sickness; angioneurotic edema Endocrine Disorders: Pseudoaldosteronism Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Hypertriglyceridemia Nervous System Disorders: Peripheral neuropathy, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, tremor Eye Disorders: Visual disturbances, including vision blurred and diplopia Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Transient or permanent hearing loss Cardiac Disorders: Congestive heart failure, bradycardia Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Pulmonary edema Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis Hepatobiliary Disorders : Serious hepatotoxicity (including some cases of fatal acute liver failure), hepatitis, reversible increases in hepatic enzymes Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, alopecia, photosensitivity, urticaria Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Arthralgia Renal and Urinary Disorders: Urinary incontinence, pollakiuria Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Erectile dysfunction General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Peripheral edema Investigations: Blood creatine phosphokinase increased There is limited information on the use of itraconazole during pregnancy. Cases of congenital abnormalities including skeletal, genitourinary tract, cardiovascular and ophthalmic malformations as well as chromosomal and multiple malformations have been reported during postmarketing experience. A causal relationship with itraconazole has not been established.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following oral administration. As a consequence of non-linear pharmacokinetics, itraconazole accumulates in plasma during multiple dosing. Steady-state concentrations are generally reached within about 15 days, with C max values of 0.5 \u03bcg/mL, 1.1 \u03bcg/mL and 2.0 \u03bcg/mL after oral administration of 100 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily and 200 mg b.i.d., respectively. The terminal half-life of itraconazole generally ranges from 16 to 28 hours after single dose and increases to 34 to 42 hours with repeated dosing. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. Itraconazole mean total plasma clearance following intravenous administration is 278 mL/min. Itraconazole clearance decreases at higher doses due to saturable hepatic metabolism. Absorption Itraconazole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following an oral capsule dose. The observed absolute oral bioavailability of itraconazole is about 55%. The oral bioavailability of itraconazole is maximal when Itraconazole Capsules are taken immediately after a full meal. Absorption of itraconazole capsules is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g., H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Absorption of itraconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when Itraconazole Capsules are administered with an acidic beverage (such as a non-diet cola). When Itraconazole Capsules were administered as a single 200-mg dose under fasted conditions with non-diet cola after ranitidine pretreatment, a H 2 -receptor antagonist, itraconazole absorption was comparable to that observed when Itraconazole Capsules were administered alone. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Itraconazole exposure is lower with the Capsule formulation than with the Oral Solution when the same dose of drug is given. (See WARNINGS .) Distribution Most of the itraconazole in plasma is bound to protein (99.8%), with albumin being the main binding component (99.6% for the hydroxy-metabolite). It has also a marked affinity for lipids. Only 0.2% of the itraconazole in plasma is present as free drug. Itraconazole is distributed in a large apparent volume in the body (>700 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Concentrations in lung, kidney, liver, bone, stomach, spleen and muscle were found to be two to three times higher than corresponding concentrations in plasma, and the uptake into keratinous tissues, skin in particular, up to four times higher. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are much lower than in plasma. Metabolism Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into a large number of metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of itraconazole. The main metabolite is hydroxy-itraconazole, which has in vitro antifungal activity comparable to itraconazole; trough plasma concentrations of this metabolite are about twice those of itraconazole. Excretion Itraconazole is excreted mainly as inactive metabolites in urine (35%) and in feces (54%) within one week of an oral solution dose. Renal excretion of itraconazole and the active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole account for less than 1% of an intravenous dose. Based on an oral radiolabeled dose, fecal excretion of unchanged drug ranges from 3% to 18% of the dose. As re-distribution of itraconazole from keratinous tissues appears to be negligible, elimination of itraconazole from these tissues is related to epidermal regeneration. Contrary to plasma, the concentration in skin persists for 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of a 4-week treatment and in nail keratin \u2013 where itraconazole can be detected as early as 1 week after start of treatment \u2013 for at least six months after the end of a 3-month treatment period. Special Populations Renal Impairment Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. A pharmacokinetic study using a single 200 mg oral dose of itraconazole was conducted in three groups of patients with renal impairment (uremia: n=7; hemodialysis: n=7; and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: n=5). In uremic subjects with a mean creatinine clearance of 13 mL/min. \u00d7 1.73 m 2 , the exposure, based on AUC, was slightly reduced compared with normal population parameters. This study did not demonstrate any significant effect of hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole (T max , C max , and AUC 0\u20138h ). Plasma concentration-versus-time profiles showed wide intersubject variation in all three groups. After a single intravenous dose, the mean terminal half-lives of itraconazole in patients with mild (defined in this study as CrCl 50\u201379 mL/min), moderate (defined in this study as CrCl 20\u201349 mL/min), and severe renal impairment (defined in this study as CrCl <20 mL/min) were similar to that in healthy subjects (range of means 42\u201349 hours vs 48 hours in renally impaired patients and healthy subjects, respectively). Overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was decreased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, as compared with subjects with normal renal function. Data are not available in renally impaired patients during long-term use of itraconazole. Dialysis has no effect on the half-life or clearance of itraconazole or hydroxy-itraconazole. (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Hepatic Impairment Itraconazole is predominantly metabolized in the liver. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 6 healthy and 12 cirrhotic subjects who were administered a single 100 mg dose of itraconazole as capsule. A statistically significant reduction in mean C max (47%) and a twofold increase in the elimination half-life (37\u00b117 hours vs. 16\u00b15 hours) of itraconazole were noted in cirrhotic subjects compared with healthy subjects. However, overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Data are not available in cirrhotic patients during long-term use of itraconazole. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Decreased Cardiac Contractility When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure appear during administration of Itraconazole Capsules, itraconazole should be discontinued. (See BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information.) MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action In vitro studies have demonstrated that itraconazole inhibits the cytochrome P450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. Antimicrobial Activity Itraconazole exhibits in vitro activity against Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Histoplasma duboisii, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Trichophyton species (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Description of Clinical Studies ). Susceptibility Testing Methods For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC. Resistance Isolates from several fungal species with decreased susceptibility to itraconazole have been isolated in vitro and from patients receiving prolonged therapy. Itraconazole is not active against Zygomycetes (e.g., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Mucor spp. and Absidia spp.), Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp. Cross-Resistance Several in vitro studies have reported that some fungal clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility to one azole antifungal agent may also be less susceptible to other azole derivatives. The finding of cross-resistance is dependent on a number of factors, including the species evaluated, its clinical history, the particular azole compounds compared, and the type of susceptibility test that is performed. Studies (both in vitro and in vivo ) suggest that the activity of amphotericin B may be suppressed by prior azole antifungal therapy. As with other azoles, itraconazole inhibits the 14 C-demethylation step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a cell wall component of fungi. Ergosterol is the active site for amphotericin B. In one study the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatus infections in mice was inhibited by ketoconazole therapy. The clinical significance of test results obtained in this study is unknown."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following oral administration. As a consequence of non-linear pharmacokinetics, itraconazole accumulates in plasma during multiple dosing. Steady-state concentrations are generally reached within about 15 days, with C max values of 0.5 \u03bcg/mL, 1.1 \u03bcg/mL and 2.0 \u03bcg/mL after oral administration of 100 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily and 200 mg b.i.d., respectively. The terminal half-life of itraconazole generally ranges from 16 to 28 hours after single dose and increases to 34 to 42 hours with repeated dosing. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. Itraconazole mean total plasma clearance following intravenous administration is 278 mL/min. Itraconazole clearance decreases at higher doses due to saturable hepatic metabolism. Absorption Itraconazole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following an oral capsule dose. The observed absolute oral bioavailability of itraconazole is about 55%. The oral bioavailability of itraconazole is maximal when Itraconazole Capsules are taken immediately after a full meal. Absorption of itraconazole capsules is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g., H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Absorption of itraconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when Itraconazole Capsules are administered with an acidic beverage (such as a non-diet cola). When Itraconazole Capsules were administered as a single 200-mg dose under fasted conditions with non-diet cola after ranitidine pretreatment, a H 2 -receptor antagonist, itraconazole absorption was comparable to that observed when Itraconazole Capsules were administered alone. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Itraconazole exposure is lower with the Capsule formulation than with the Oral Solution when the same dose of drug is given. (See WARNINGS .) Distribution Most of the itraconazole in plasma is bound to protein (99.8%), with albumin being the main binding component (99.6% for the hydroxy-metabolite). It has also a marked affinity for lipids. Only 0.2% of the itraconazole in plasma is present as free drug. Itraconazole is distributed in a large apparent volume in the body (>700 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Concentrations in lung, kidney, liver, bone, stomach, spleen and muscle were found to be two to three times higher than corresponding concentrations in plasma, and the uptake into keratinous tissues, skin in particular, up to four times higher. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are much lower than in plasma. Metabolism Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into a large number of metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of itraconazole. The main metabolite is hydroxy-itraconazole, which has in vitro antifungal activity comparable to itraconazole; trough plasma concentrations of this metabolite are about twice those of itraconazole. Excretion Itraconazole is excreted mainly as inactive metabolites in urine (35%) and in feces (54%) within one week of an oral solution dose. Renal excretion of itraconazole and the active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole account for less than 1% of an intravenous dose. Based on an oral radiolabeled dose, fecal excretion of unchanged drug ranges from 3% to 18% of the dose. As re-distribution of itraconazole from keratinous tissues appears to be negligible, elimination of itraconazole from these tissues is related to epidermal regeneration. Contrary to plasma, the concentration in skin persists for 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of a 4-week treatment and in nail keratin \u2013 where itraconazole can be detected as early as 1 week after start of treatment \u2013 for at least six months after the end of a 3-month treatment period. Special Populations Renal Impairment Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. A pharmacokinetic study using a single 200 mg oral dose of itraconazole was conducted in three groups of patients with renal impairment (uremia: n=7; hemodialysis: n=7; and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: n=5). In uremic subjects with a mean creatinine clearance of 13 mL/min. \u00d7 1.73 m 2 , the exposure, based on AUC, was slightly reduced compared with normal population parameters. This study did not demonstrate any significant effect of hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole (T max , C max , and AUC 0\u20138h ). Plasma concentration-versus-time profiles showed wide intersubject variation in all three groups. After a single intravenous dose, the mean terminal half-lives of itraconazole in patients with mild (defined in this study as CrCl 50\u201379 mL/min), moderate (defined in this study as CrCl 20\u201349 mL/min), and severe renal impairment (defined in this study as CrCl <20 mL/min) were similar to that in healthy subjects (range of means 42\u201349 hours vs 48 hours in renally impaired patients and healthy subjects, respectively). Overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was decreased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, as compared with subjects with normal renal function. Data are not available in renally impaired patients during long-term use of itraconazole. Dialysis has no effect on the half-life or clearance of itraconazole or hydroxy-itraconazole. (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Hepatic Impairment Itraconazole is predominantly metabolized in the liver. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 6 healthy and 12 cirrhotic subjects who were administered a single 100 mg dose of itraconazole as capsule. A statistically significant reduction in mean C max (47%) and a twofold increase in the elimination half-life (37\u00b117 hours vs. 16\u00b15 hours) of itraconazole were noted in cirrhotic subjects compared with healthy subjects. However, overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Data are not available in cirrhotic patients during long-term use of itraconazole. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Decreased Cardiac Contractility When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure appear during administration of Itraconazole Capsules, itraconazole should be discontinued.

      "MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action In vitro studies have demonstrated that itraconazole inhibits the cytochrome P450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. Antimicrobial Activity Itraconazole exhibits in vitro activity against Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Histoplasma duboisii, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Trichophyton species (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Description of Clinical Studies ). Susceptibility Testing Methods For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC. Resistance Isolates from several fungal species with decreased susceptibility to itraconazole have been isolated in vitro and from patients receiving prolonged therapy. Itraconazole is not active against Zygomycetes (e.g., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Mucor spp. and Absidia spp.), Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp. Cross-Resistance Several in vitro studies have reported that some fungal clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility to one azole antifungal agent may also be less susceptible to other azole derivatives. The finding of cross-resistance is dependent on a number of factors, including the species evaluated, its clinical history, the particular azole compounds compared, and the type of susceptibility test that is performed. Studies (both in vitro and in vivo ) suggest that the activity of amphotericin B may be suppressed by prior azole antifungal therapy. As with other azoles, itraconazole inhibits the 14 C-demethylation step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a cell wall component of fungi. Ergosterol is the active site for amphotericin B. In one study the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatus infections in mice was inhibited by ketoconazole therapy.

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Itraconazole Capsules are indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients: Blastomycosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non-meningeal histoplasmosis, and Aspergillosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, in patients who are intolerant of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy. Specimens for fungal cultures and other relevant laboratory studies (wet mount, histopathology, serology) should be obtained before therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, antiinfective therapy should be adjusted accordingly. Itraconazole Capsules are also indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients: Onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium), and Onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium). Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing (KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations , CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information.) Description of Clinical Studies Blastomycosis Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=73 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status. The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 6 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of blastomycosis compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=34 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status (not including HIV-infected patients). The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 12 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of histoplasmosis, compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients Data from a small number of HIV-infected patients suggested that the response rate of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is similar to that of non-HIV-infected patients. The clinical course of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is more severe and usually requires maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Aspergillosis Analyses were conducted on data from an open-label, \"single-patient-use\" protocol designed to make itraconazole available in the U.S. for patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy (N=190). The findings were corroborated by two smaller open-label studies (N=31 combined) in the same patient population. Most adult patients were treated with a daily dose of 200 to 400 mg, with a median duration of 3 months. Results of these studies demonstrated substantial evidence of effectiveness of itraconazole as a second-line therapy for the treatment of aspergillosis compared with the natural history of the disease in patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy. Onychomycosis of the toenail Analyses were conducted on data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (N=214 total; 110 given Itraconazole Capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the toenails received 200 mg of Itraconazole Capsules once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Results of these studies demonstrated mycologic cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 54% of patients. Thirty-five percent (35%) of patients were considered an overall success (mycologic cure plus clear or minimal nail involvement with significantly decreased signs) and 14% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure (clearance of all signs, with or without residual nail deformity). The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months. Twenty-one percent (21%) of the overall success group had a relapse (worsening of the global score or conversion of KOH or culture from negative to positive). Onychomycosis of the fingernail Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N=73 total; 37 given Itraconazole Capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course (pulse) of 200 mg of Itraconazole Capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without Itraconazole Capsules, which was followed by a second 1-week pulse of 200 mg of Itraconazole Capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent (56%) of patients were considered an overall success and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Congestive Heart Failure Itraconazole Capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. (See BOXED WARNING , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions-Calcium Channel Blockers, ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience , and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations .) Drug Interactions Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole. Some examples of drugs for which plasma concentrations increase are: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor, finerenone, voclosporin. In addition, coadministration with colchicine, fesoterodine and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, and coadministration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples.) This increase in drug concentrations caused by coadministration with itraconazole may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Some specific examples are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. Coadministration with venetoclax is contraindicated in patients with CLL/SLL during the dose initiation and ramp-up phase of venetoclax due to the potential for an increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole is contraindicated for patients who have shown hypersensitivity to itraconazole. There is limited information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between itraconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing itraconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Itraconazole Capsules should be administered after a full meal. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Hepatotoxicity: Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with itraconazole treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving itraconazole. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction. Neuropathy: If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to Itraconazole Capsules, the treatment should be discontinued. Immunocompromised Patients: In some immunocompromised patients (e.g., neutropenic, AIDS or organ transplant patients), the oral bioavailability of Itraconazole capsules may be decreased. Therefore, the dose should be adjusted based on the clinical response in these patients. Cystic Fibrosis: If a cystic fibrosis patient does not respond to Itraconazole Capsules, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. For more information concerning the use of itraconazole in cystic fibrosis patients see the prescribing information for SPORANOX \u00ae Oral Solution. Hearing Loss: Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions , CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Information for Patients: The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between Itraconazole Capsules and SPORANOX \u00ae (itraconazole) Oral Solution. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole Capsules should not be used interchangeably with SPORANOX \u00ae (itraconazole) Oral Solution. Instruct patients to take Itraconazole Capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole Capsules must be swallowed whole. Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines. Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole Capsules on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, Itraconazole Capsules has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. Table 1 lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but it is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential, and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with Itraconazole Capsules. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with Itraconazole Capsules.

Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Meloxicam Concomitant drug dose increase may be necessary. Effect of Other Drugs on Itraconazole Capsules Itraconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole. Some concomitant drugs have the potential to interact with Itraconazole Capsules resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of Itraconazole Capsules. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with Itraconazole Capsules. Decreased concentrations may reduce Itraconazole Capsules efficacy. Table 2 lists examples of drugs that may affect itraconazole concentrations, but is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with Itraconazole Capsules. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 2 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with Itraconazole Capsules.

Use with caution. Administer acid neutralizing medicines at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after the intake of Itraconazole Capsules. Miscellaneous Drugs and Other Substances Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor Not recommended 2 weeks before, during, and 2 weeks after Itraconazole Capsules treatment. Pediatric Population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 400 mg/day based on body surface area comparisons). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation ( Drosophila melanogaster ) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40\u2013160 mg/kg/day (1\u20134 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During postmarketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience .) Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants. Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD of 400 mg based on body surface area comparisons). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Itraconazole Capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use Itraconazole Capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions , CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). HIV-Infected Patients: Because hypochlorhydria has been reported in HIV-infected individuals, the absorption of itraconazole in these patients may be decreased. Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. The exposure of itraconazole may be lower in some patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when itraconazole is administered in this patient population and dose adjustment may be needed. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. It is recommended that patients with impaired hepatic function be carefully monitored when taking itraconazole. It is recommended that the prolonged elimination half-life of itraconazole observed in the single oral dose clinical trial with Itraconazole Capsules in cirrhotic patients be considered when deciding to initiate therapy with other medications metabolized by CYP3A4. In patients with elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be done in patients with pre-existing hepatic function abnormalities or those who have experienced liver toxicity with other medications.

    "general_precautions": [
      "General: Itraconazole Capsules should be administered after a full meal. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism )."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients: The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between Itraconazole Capsules and SPORANOX \u00ae (itraconazole) Oral Solution. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole Capsules should not be used interchangeably with SPORANOX \u00ae (itraconazole) Oral Solution. Instruct patients to take Itraconazole Capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole Capsules must be swallowed whole. Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole Capsules on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, Itraconazole Capsules has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. Table 1 lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but it is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential, and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with Itraconazole Capsules. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with Itraconazole Capsules.

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 400 mg/day based on body surface area comparisons). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation ( Drosophila melanogaster ) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons)."

      "Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40\u2013160 mg/kg/day (1\u20134 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During postmarketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience .)"

      "Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD of 400 mg based on body surface area comparisons). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats."

It is advised to use Itraconazole Capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions , CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hepatic Effects: Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Continued itraconazole use or reinstitution of treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Cardiac Dysrhythmias: Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with itraconazole and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with itraconazole is contraindicated. (See BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Cardiac Disease: Itraconazole Capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. Itraconazole Capsules should not be used for other indications in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. For patients with risk factors for congestive heart failure, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of itraconazole therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Such patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF, should be treated with caution, and should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear during administration of Itraconazole Capsules, discontinue administration. Itraconazole has been shown to have a negative inotropic effect. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. Itraconazole has been associated with reports of congestive heart failure. In postmarketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving a total daily dose of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses. Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of itraconazole and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated. Cases of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the postmarketing period among patients being treated for onychomycosis and/or systemic fungal infections. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations , CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information.) Pseudoaldosteronism: Pseudoaldosteronism, manifested by the onset of hypertension or worsening of hypertension, and abnormal laboratory findings (hypokalemia, low serum renin and aldosterone, and elevated 11-deoxycortisol), has been reported with itraconazole use in the postmarketing setting. Monitor blood pressure and potassium levels and manage as necessary. Management of pseudoaldosteronism may include discontinuation of Itraconazole Capsules, substitution with an appropriate antifungal drug that is not associated with pseudoaldosteronism, or use of aldosterone receptor antagonists. Interaction Potential: Itraconazole has a potential for clinically important drug interactions. Coadministration of specific drugs with itraconazole may result in changes in efficacy of itraconazole and/or the coadministered drug, life-threatening effects and/or sudden death. Drugs that are contraindicated, not recommended or recommended for use with caution in combination with itraconazole are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. Interchangeability: Itraconazole Capsules and SPORANOX \u00ae (itraconazole) Oral Solution should not be used interchangeably. This is because drug exposure is greater with the Oral Solution than with the Capsules when the same dose of drug is given. In addition, the topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the two formulations. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of itraconazole use should be reassessed. (See WARNINGS: Hepatic Effects and PRECAUTIONS: Hepatotoxicity and Information for Patients .) Adverse Events in the Treatment of Systemic Fungal Infections Adverse event data were derived from 602 patients treated for systemic fungal disease in U.S. clinical trials who were immunocompromised or receiving multiple concomitant medications. Treatment was discontinued in 10.5% of patients due to adverse events. The median duration before discontinuation of therapy was 81 days (range: 2 to 776 days).

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Itraconazole Capsules should be taken with a full meal to ensure maximal absorption. Itraconazole Capsules must be swallowed whole. Itraconazole Capsules are a different preparation than SPORANOX \u00ae (itraconazole) Oral Solution and should not be used interchangeably. Treatment of Blastomycosis and Histoplasmosis The recommended dose is 200 mg once daily (2 capsules). If there is no obvious improvement, or there is evidence of progressive fungal disease, the dose should be increased in 100-mg increments to a maximum of 400 mg daily. Doses above 200 mg/day should be given in two divided doses. Treatment of Aspergillosis A daily dose of 200 to 400 mg is recommended. Treatment in Life-Threatening Situations In life-threatening situations, a loading dose should be used. Although clinical studies did not provide for a loading dose, it is recommended, based on pharmacokinetic data, that a loading dose of 200 mg (2 capsules) three times daily (600 mg/day) be given for the first 3 days of treatment. Treatment should be continued for a minimum of three months and until clinical parameters and laboratory tests indicate that the active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Itraconazole Capsules and SPORANOX \u00ae (itraconazole) Oral Solution should not be used interchangeably.

If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure occur during administration of itraconazole capsules, discontinue administration. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to dogs and healthy human volunteers, negative inotropic effects were seen (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions, ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations for more information). Drug Interactions: Co-administration of the following drugs are contraindicated with itraconazole capsules: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, lovastatin, simvastatin, ticagrelor and, in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, colchicine, fesoterodine, telithromycin and solifenacin (see PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions Section for specific examples). Co-administration with itraconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS Sections, and PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions Section for specific examples)."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following oral administration. As a consequence of non-linear pharmacokinetics, itraconazole accumulates in plasma during multiple dosing. Steady-state concentrations are generally reached within about 15 days, with C max values of 0.5 mcg/ml, 1.1 mcg/ml and 2 mcg/ml after oral administration of 100 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily and 200 mg b.i.d., respectively. The terminal half-life of itraconazole generally ranges from 16 to 28 hours after single dose and increases to 34 to 42 hours with repeated dosing. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. Itraconazole mean total plasma clearance following intravenous administration is 278 ml/min. Itraconazole clearance decreases at higher doses due to saturable hepatic metabolism. Absorption Itraconazole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following an oral capsule dose. The observed absolute oral bioavailability of itraconazole is about 55%. The oral bioavailability of itraconazole is maximal when itraconazole capsules are taken immediately after a full meal. Absorption of itraconazole capsules is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g., H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Absorption of itraconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when itraconazole capsules are administered with an acidic beverage (such as a non-diet cola). When itraconazole capsules were administered as a single 200-mg dose under fasted conditions with non-diet cola after ranitidine pretreatment, a H 2 -receptor antagonist, itraconazole absorption was comparable to that observed when itraconazole capsules were administered alone (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Itraconazole exposure is lower with the capsule formulation than with the oral solution when the same dose of drug is given (see WARNINGS ). Distribution Most of the itraconazole in plasma is bound to protein (99.8%), with albumin being the main binding component (99.6% for the hydroxy-metabolite). It has also a marked affinity for lipids. Only 0.2% of the itraconazole in plasma is present as free drug. Itraconazole is distributed in a large apparent volume in the body (>700 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Concentrations in lung, kidney, liver, bone, stomach, spleen and muscle were found to be two to three times higher than corresponding concentrations in plasma, and the uptake into keratinous tissues, skin in particular, up to four times higher. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are much lower than in plasma. Metabolism Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into a large number of metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of itraconazole. The main metabolite is hydroxy-itraconazole, which has in vitro antifungal activity comparable to itraconazole; trough plasma concentrations of this metabolite are about twice those of itraconazole. Excretion Itraconazole is excreted mainly as inactive metabolites in urine (35%) and in feces (54%) within one week of an oral solution dose. Renal excretion of itraconazole and the active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole account for less than 1% of an intravenous dose. Based on an oral radiolabeled dose, fecal excretion of unchanged drug ranges from 3% to 18% of the dose. As re-distribution of itraconazole from keratinous tissues appears to be negligible, elimination of itraconazole from these tissues is related to epidermal regeneration. Contrary to plasma, the concentration in skin persists for 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of a 4-week treatment and in nail keratin \u2013 where itraconazole can be detected as early as 1 week after start of treatment \u2013 for at least six months after the end of a 3-month treatment period. Special Populations: Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. A pharmacokinetic study using a single 200-mg oral dose of itraconazole was conducted in three groups of patients with renal impairment (uremia: n=7; hemodialysis: n=7; and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: n=5). In uremic subjects with a mean creatinine clearance of 13 mL/min. \u00d7 1.73 m 2 , the exposure, based on AUC, was slightly reduced compared with normal population parameters. This study did not demonstrate any significant effect of hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole (T max , C max , and AUC 0 - 8h ). Plasma concentration-versus-time profiles showed wide intersubject variation in all three groups. After a single intravenous dose, the mean terminal half-lives of itraconazole in patients with mild (defined in this study as CrCl 50 to 79 ml/min), moderate (defined in this study as CrCl 20 to 49 ml/min), and severe renal impairment (defined in this study as CrCl <20 ml/min) were similar to that in healthy subjects (range of means 42 to 49 hours vs 48 hours in renally impaired patients and healthy subjects, respectively). Overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was decreased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, as compared with subjects with normal renal function. Data are not available in renally impaired patients during long-term use of itraconazole. Dialysis has no effect on the half-life or clearance of itraconazole or hydroxy-itraconazole (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Impairment: Itraconazole is predominantly metabolized in the liver. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 6 healthy and 12 cirrhotic subjects who were administered a single 100-mg dose of itraconazole as capsule. A statistically significant reduction in mean C max (47%) and a twofold increase in the elimination half-life (37 \u00b1 17 hours vs. 16 \u00b1 5 hours) of itraconazole were noted in cirrhotic subjects compared with healthy subjects. However, overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Data are not available in cirrhotic patients during long-term use of itraconazole (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Decreased Cardiac Contractility: When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, itraconazole should be discontinued (see BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS : Post-marketing Experience for more information). MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action: In vitro studies have demonstrated that itraconazole inhibits the cytochrome P450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. Antimicrobial Activity: Itraconazole exhibits in vitro activity against Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Histoplasma duboisii, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Trichophyton species (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Description of Clinical Studies). Susceptibility Testing Methods: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC. Resistance: Isolates from several fungal species with decreased susceptibility to itraconazole have been isolated in vitro and from patients receiving prolonged therapy. Itraconazole is not active against Zygomycetes (e.g., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Mucor spp. and Absidia spp.), Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp. Cross-resistance: Several in vitro studies have reported that some fungal clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility to one azole antifungal agent may also be less susceptible to other azole derivatives. The finding of cross-resistance is dependent on a number of factors, including the species evaluated, its clinical history, the particular azole compounds compared, and the type of susceptibility test that is performed. Studies (both in vitro and in vivo) suggest that the activity of amphotericin B may be suppressed by prior azole antifungal therapy. As with other azoles, itraconazole inhibits the 14C-demethylation step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a cell wall component of fungi. Ergosterol is the active site for amphotericin B. In one study the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatus infections in mice was inhibited by ketoconazole therapy. The clinical significance of test results obtained in this study is unknown."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Itraconazole capsules are indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients: Blastomycosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non-meningeal histoplasmosis, and Aspergillosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, in patients who are intolerant of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy. Specimens for fungal cultures and other relevant laboratory studies (wet mount, histopathology, serology) should be obtained before therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, antiinfective therapy should be adjusted accordingly. Itraconazole capsules are also indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients: Onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium), and Onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium). Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing (KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and ADVERSE REACTIONS : Post-marketing Experience for more information). Description of Clinical Studies: Blastomycosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=73 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status. The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 6 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of blastomycosis compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=34 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status (not including HIV-infected patients). The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 12 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of histoplasmosis, compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients: Data from a small number of HIV-infected patients suggested that the response rate of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is similar to that of non-HIV-infected patients. The clinical course of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is more severe and usually requires maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Aspergillosis: Analyses were conducted on data from an open-label, \u201csingle-patient-use\u201d protocol designed to make itraconazole available in the U.S. for patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy (N=190). The findings were corroborated by two smaller open-label studies (N=31 combined) in the same patient population. Most adult patients were treated with a daily dose of 200 to 400 mg, with a median duration of 3 months. Results of these studies demonstrated substantial evidence of effectiveness of itraconazole as a second-line therapy for the treatment of aspergillosis compared with the natural history of the disease in patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy. Onychomycosis of the toenail: Analyses were conducted on data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (N=214 total; 110 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the toenails received 200 mg of itraconazole capsules once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Results of these studies demonstrated mycologic cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 54% of patients. Thirty-five percent (35%) of patients were considered an overall success (mycologic cure plus clear or minimal nail involvement with significantly decreased signs) and 14% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure (clearance of all signs, with or without residual nail deformity). The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months. Twenty-one percent (21%) of the overall success group had a relapse (worsening of the global score or conversion of KOH or culture from negative to positive). Onychomycosis of the fingernail: Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N=73 total; 37 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without itraconazole capsules, which was followed by a second 1-week course of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent (56%) of patients were considered an overall success and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Congestive Heart Failure: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF (see BOXED WARNING , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions-Calcium Channel Blockers, ADVERSE REACTIONS : Post-marketing Experience, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations) . Drug Interactions: Co-administration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole. Plasma concentrations increase for the following drugs: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, lovastatin, simvastatin, ticagrelor, and, in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, colchicine, fesoterodine, telithromycin and solifenacin (see PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions Section for specific examples). This increase in drug concentrations caused by co-administration with itraconazole may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effect and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Specific examples are listed in PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole capsules are contraindicated for patients who have shown hypersensitivity to itraconazole. There is limited information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between itraconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing itraconazole capsules to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hepatic Effects: Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Continued itraconazole use or reinstitution of treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk (see PRECAUTIONS : Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Cardiac Dysrhythmias: Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with itraconazole and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with itraconazole is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions ). Cardiac Disease: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. Itraconazole capsules should not be used for other indications in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. For patients with risk factors for congestive heart failure, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of itraconazole therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Such patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF, should be treated with caution, and should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, discontinue administration. Itraconazole has been shown to have a negative inotropic effect. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. Itraconazole has been associated with reports of congestive heart failure. In post-marketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving a total daily dose of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses. Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of itraconazole and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated. Cases of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the post-marketing period among patients being treated for onychomycosis and/or systemic fungal infections (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions, and ADVERSE REACTIONS : Post-marketing Experience for more information). Pseudoaldosteronism: Pseudoaldosteronism, manifested by the onset of hypertension or worsening of hypertension, and abnormal laboratory findings (hypokalemia, low serum renin and aldosterone, and elevated 11-deoxycortisol), has been reported with itraconazole use in the postmarketing setting. Monitor blood pressure and potassium levels and manage as necessary. Management of pseudoaldosteronism may include discontinuation of itraconazole, substitution with an appropriate antifungal drug that is not associated with pseudoaldosteronism, or use of aldosterone receptor antagonists. Interaction potential: Itraconazole has a potential for clinically important drug interactions. Co-administration of specific drugs with itraconazole may result in changes in efficacy of itraconazole and/or the co-administered drug, life-threatening effects and/or sudden death. Drugs that are contraindicated, not recommended or recommended for use with caution in combination with itraconazole are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. Interchangeability: Itraconazole capsules and itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably. This is because drug exposure is greater with the Oral Solution than with the Capsules when the same dose of drug is given. In addition, the topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the two formulations. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Itraconazole capsules should be administered after a full meal (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism) . Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism) . Hepatotoxicity: Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with itraconazole treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving itraconazole. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction. Neuropathy: If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to itraconazole capsules, the treatment should be discontinued. Immunocompromised Patients: In some immunocompromised patients (e.g., neutropenic, AIDS or organ transplant patients), the oral bioavailability of itraconazole capsules may be decreased. Therefore, the dose should be adjusted based on the clinical response in these patients. Cystic Fibrosis: If a cystic fibrosis patient does not respond to itraconazole capsules, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. For more information concerning the use of itraconazole in cystic fibrosis patients see the prescribing information for itraconazole oral solution. Hearing Loss: Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING : Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS : Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Information for Patients: The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the itraconazole capsules and oral solution. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole oral solution. Instruct patients to take itraconazole capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines. Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. Table 1 lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but it is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential, and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole. Table 1: Drugs Interactions with Itraconazole that Affect Concomitant Drug Concentrations Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances is the drug to be co-administered with itraconazole, and up to two weeks after discontinuation of treatment with itraconazole. It is recommended that the use of the drug be avoided during and up to two weeks after discontinuation of treatment with itraconazole, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If co-administration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, it is recommended that plasma concentrations be measured. The label of the co-administered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is co-administered with itraconazole. Upon co-administration, it is recommended that patients be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, it is recommended that plasma concentrations be measured. The label of the co-administered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes. Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with itraconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when co-administered with itraconazole. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation. Antibacterials telithromycin, in subjects with severe renal impairment or severe hepatic impairment rifabutin telithromycin Telithromycin: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of telithromycin in subjects with severe renal impairment or severe hepatic impairment, when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Rifabutin: See also under \u2018Drugs that may decrease itraconazole plasma concentrations\u2019. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs ticagrelor apixaban, rivaroxaban coumarins, cilostazol, dabigatran Ticagrelor: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ticagrelor may increase the risk of bleeding. Coumarins: Itraconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, such as warfarin. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. Although there are no data regarding the effect of itraconazole on carbamazepine metabolism, because of the similarities between ketoconazole and itraconazole, concomitant administration of itraconazole and carbamazepine may inhibit the metabolism of carbamazepine. See also under \u2018Drugs that may decrease itraconazole plasma concentrations\u2019. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot Alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of ergotism, ie. a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Antineoplastics irinotecan axitinib, dabrafenib, dasatinib, ibrutinib, nilotinib, sunitinib, trabectedin bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, gefitinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, lapatinib, ponatinib, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam alprazolam, aripiprazole, buspirone, diazepam, haloperidol, midazolam IV, perospirone, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone Midazolam, triazolam: Co-administration of itraconazole and oral midazolam, or triazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes. Antivirals simeprevir maraviroc, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Indinavir, ritonavir: See also under \u2018Drugs that may increase itraconazole plasma concentrations\u2019. Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of itraconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of itraconazole may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Edema has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving itraconazole and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous Ivabradine, ranolazine aliskiren, sildenafil, for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension bosentan, riociguat Ivabradine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ivabradine when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of ivabradine-related adverse events, such as atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, sinus arrest and heart block. Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation. Diuretics eplerenone Eplerenone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of cisapride when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), tacrolimus Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, in subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment, or moderate to severe hepatic impairment, solifenacin, in subjects with severe renal impairment or moderate to severe hepatic impairment darifenacin, vardenafil fesoterodine, oxybutynin, sildenafil, for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine Fesoterodine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of the fesoterodine active metabolite may be greater in subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment, or moderate to severe hepatic impairment, which may lead to an increased risk of adverse reactions. Solifenacin: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of solifenacin in subjects with severe renal impairment or moderate to severe hepatic impairment, when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment colchicine, conivaptan, tolvaptan cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Conivaptan and Tolvaptan: A safe and effective dose of either conivaptan or tolvaptan has not been established when co-administered with itraconazole. Effect of Other Drugs on Itraconazole Itraconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole. Some concomitant drugs have the potential to interact with itraconazole resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of itraconazole. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with itraconazole. Decreased concentrations may reduce itraconazole efficacy. Table 2 lists examples of drugs that may affect itraconazole concentrations, but is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 2 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole. Table 2: Drug Interactions with Other Drugs that Affect Itraconazole Concentrations Pediatric Population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 400 mg/day based on body surface area comparisons). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli, in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sexlinked recessive lethal mutation (Drosophila melanogaster) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T&frac12; C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 mg/kg/day to 160 mg/kg/day (1 to 4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During post-marketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience). Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants. Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD of 400 mg based on body surface area comparisons). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). HIV-Infected Patients: Because hypochlorhydria has been reported in HIV-infected individuals, the absorption of itraconazole in these patients may be decreased. Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. The exposure of itraconazole may be lower in some patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when itraconazole is administered in this patient population and dose adjustment may be needed (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. It is recommended that patients with impaired hepatic function be carefully monitored when taking itraconazole. It is recommended that the prolonged elimination half-life of itraconazole observed in the single oral dose clinical trial with itraconazole capsules in cirrhotic patients be considered when deciding to initiate therapy with other medications metabolized by CYP3A4. In patients with elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be done in patients with pre-existing hepatic function abnormalities or those who have experienced liver toxicity with other medications (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). 1 1"

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of itraconazole use should be reassessed (see WARNINGS : Hepatic Effects and PRECAUTIONS : Hepatotoxicity and Information for Patients). Adverse Events in the Treatment of Systemic Fungal Infections Adverse event data were derived from 602 patients treated for systemic fungal disease in U.S. clinical trials who were immunocompromised or receiving multiple concomitant medications. Treatment was discontinued in 10.5% of patients due to adverse events. The median duration before discontinuation of therapy was 81 days (range: 2 to 776 days). The table lists adverse events reported by at least 1% of patients. Table 2: Clinical Trials of Systemic Fungal Infections: Adverse Events Occurring with an Incidence of Greater than or Equal to 1% Body System/Adverse Event Incidence (%) (N=602) Gastrointestinal Nausea 11 Vomiting 5 Diarrhea 3 Abdominal Pain 2 Anorexia 1 Body as a Whole Edema 4 Fatigue 3 Fever 3 Malaise 1 Skin and Appendages Rash* 9 Pruritus 3 Central/Peripheral Nervous System Headache 4 Dizziness 2 Psychiatric Libido Decreased 1 Somnolence 1 Cardiovascular Hypertension 3 Metabolic/Nutritional Hypokalemia 2 Urinary System Albuminuria 1 Liver and Biliary System Hepatic Function Abnormal 3 Reproductive System, Male Impotence 1 * Rash tends to occur more frequently in immunocompromised patients receiving immunosuppressive medications. Adverse events infrequently reported in all studies included constipation, gastritis, depression, insomnia, tinnitus, menstrual disorder, adrenal insufficiency, gynecomastia, and male breast pain. Adverse Events Reported in Toenail Onychomycosis Clinical Trials Patients in these trials were on a continuous dosing regimen of 200 mg once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. The following adverse events led to temporary or permanent discontinuation of therapy. Table 3: Clinical Trials of Onychomycosis of the Toenail: Adverse Events Leading to Temporary or Permanent Discontinuation of Therapy Adverse Event Incidence (%) Itraconazole (N=112) Elevated Liver Enzymes (greater than twice the upper limit of normal) 4 Gastrointestinal Disorders 4 Rash 3 Hypertension 2 Orthostatic Hypotension 1 Headache 1 Malaise 1 Myalgia 1 Vasculitis 1 Vertigo 1 The following adverse events occurred with an incidence of greater than or equal to 1% (N=112): headache: 10%; rhinitis: 9%; upper respiratory tract infection: 8%; sinusitis, injury: 7%; diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, abdominal pain, dizziness, rash: 4%; cystitis, urinary tract infection, liver function abnormality, myalgia, nausea: 3%; appetite increased, constipation, gastritis, gastroenteritis, pharyngitis, asthenia, fever, pain, tremor, herpes zoster, abnormal dreaming: 2%. Adverse Events Reported in Fingernail Onychomycosis Clinical Trials Patients in these trials were on a dosing regimen consisting of two 1-week treatment periods of 200 mg twice daily, separated by a 3-week period without drug. The following adverse events led to temporary or permanent discontinuation of therapy. Table 4: Clinical Trials of Onychomycosis of the Fingernail: Adverse Events Leading to Temporary or Permanent Discontinuation of Therapy Adverse Event Incidence (%) Itraconazole (N=37) Rash/Pruritus 3 Hypertriglyceridemia 3 The following adverse events occurred with an incidence of greater than or equal to 1% (N=37): headache: 8%; pruritus, nausea, rhinitis: 5%; rash, bursitis, anxiety, depression, constipation, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, ulcerative stomatitis, gingivitis, hypertriglyceridemia, sinusitis, fatigue, malaise, pain, injury: 3%. Adverse Events Reported from Other Clinical Trials In addition, the following adverse drug reaction was reported in patients who participated in itraconazole capsules clinical trials: Hepatobiliary Disorders: hyperbilirubinemia. The following is a list of additional adverse drug reactions associated with itraconazole that have been reported in clinical trials of itraconazole oral solution and itraconazole IV excluding the adverse reaction term \u201cInjection site inflammation\u201d which is specific to the injection route of administration: Cardiac Disorders: cardiac failure, left ventricular failure, tachycardia; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: face edema, chest pain, chills; Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatic failure, jaundice; Investigations: alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, blood urea increased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, urine analysis abnormal; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia; Psychiatric Disorders: confusional state; Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal impairment; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: dysphonia, cough; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash erythematous, hyperhidrosis; Vascular Disorders: hypotension Post-marketing Experience Adverse drug reactions that have been first identified during post-marketing experience with itraconazole (all formulations) are listed in the table below. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, reliably estimating their frequency or establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is not always possible. Table 5: Postmarketing Reports of Adverse Drug Reactions Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia Immune System Disorders: Anaphylaxis; anaphylactic, anaphylactoid and allergic reactions; serum sickness; angioneurotic edema Nervous System Disorders: Peripheral neuropathy, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, tremor Eye Disorders: Visual disturbances, including vision blurred and diplopia Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Transient or permanent hearing loss Cardiac Disorders: Congestive heart failure Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Pulmonary edema, dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis, dysgeusia Hepatobiliary Disorders: Serious hepatotoxicity (including some cases of fatal acute liver failure), hepatitis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, alopecia, photosensitivity, urticaria Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Arthralgia Renal and Urinary Disorders: Urinary incontinence, pollakiuria Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Erectile dysfunction General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Peripheral edema Investigations: Blood creatine phosphokinase increased There is limited information on the use of itraconazole during pregnancy. Cases of congenital abnormalities including skeletal, genitourinary tract, cardiovascular and ophthalmic malformations as well as chromosomal and multiple malformations have been reported during post-marketing experience. A causal relationship with itraconazole has not been established (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions for more information).

Contact a certified poison control center for the most up-to-date information on the management of itraconazole capsules overdosage (1-800- 222-1222 or www.poison.org). In general, adverse events reported with overdose have been consistent with adverse drug reactions already listed in this package insert for itraconazole (see ADVERSE REACTIONS)."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Itraconazole capsules should be taken with a full meal to ensure maximal absorption. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. Itraconazole capsules are a different preparation than itraconazole oral solution and should not be used interchangeably. Treatment of Blastomycosis and Histoplasmosis: The recommended dose is 200 mg once daily (2 capsules). If there is no obvious improvement, or there is evidence of progressive fungal disease, the dose should be increased in 100-mg increments to a maximum of 400 mg daily. Doses above 200 mg/day should be given in two divided doses. Treatment of Aspergillosis: A daily dose of 200 to 400 mg is recommended. Treatment in Life-Threatening Situations: In life-threatening situations, a loading dose should be used. Although clinical studies did not provide for a loading dose, it is recommended, based on pharmacokinetic data, that a loading dose of 200 mg (2 capsules) three times daily (600 mg/day) be given for the first 3 days of treatment. Treatment should be continued for a minimum of three months and until clinical parameters and laboratory tests indicate that the active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Itraconazole capsules and itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Treatment of Onychomycosis: Toenails with or without fingernail involvement: The recommended dose is 200 mg (2 capsules) once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Treatment of Onychomycosis: Fingernails only: The recommended dosing regimen is 2 treatment courses, each consisting of 200 mg (2 capsules) b.i.d. (400 mg/day) for 1 week. The courses are separated by a 3-week period without itraconazole capsules. Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations and PRECAUTIONS ). Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations, WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS )."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following oral administration. As a consequence of non-linear pharmacokinetics, itraconazole accumulates in plasma during multiple dosing. Steady-state concentrations are generally reached within about 15 days, with C max values of 0.5 \u03bcg/mL, 1.1 \u03bcg/mL and 2.0 \u03bcg/mL after oral administration of 100 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily and 200 mg b.i.d., respectively. The terminal half-life of itraconazole generally ranges from 16 to 28 hours after single dose and increases to 34 to 42 hours with repeated dosing. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. Itraconazole mean total plasma clearance following intravenous administration is 278 mL/min. Itraconazole clearance decreases at higher doses due to saturable hepatic metabolism. Absorption Itraconazole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following an oral capsule dose. The observed absolute oral bioavailability of itraconazole is about 55%. The oral bioavailability of itraconazole is maximal when itraconazole capsules are taken immediately after a full meal. Absorption of itraconazole capsules is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g., H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) Absorption of itraconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when itraconazole capsules are administered with an acidic beverage (such as a non-diet cola). When itraconazole capsules were administered as a single 200-mg dose under fasted conditions with non-diet cola after ranitidine pretreatment, a H 2 -receptor antagonist, itraconazole absorption was comparable to that observed when itraconazole capsules were administered alone. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) Itraconazole exposure is lower with the capsule formulation than with the oral solution when the same dose of drug is given. (See WARNINGS) Distribution Most of the itraconazole in plasma is bound to protein (99.8%), with albumin being the main binding component (99.6% for the hydroxy-metabolite). It has also a marked affinity for lipids. Only 0.2% of the itraconazole in plasma is present as free drug. Itraconazole is distributed in a large apparent volume in the body (>700 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Concentrations in lung, kidney, liver, bone, stomach, spleen and muscle were found to be two to three times higher than corresponding concentrations in plasma, and the uptake into keratinous tissues, skin in particular, up to four times higher. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are much lower than in plasma. Metabolism Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into a large number of metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of itraconazole. The main metabolite is hydroxy-itraconazole, which has in vitro antifungal activity comparable to itraconazole; trough plasma concentrations of this metabolite are about twice those of itraconazole. Excretion Itraconazole is excreted mainly as inactive metabolites in urine (35%) and in feces (54%) within one week of an oral solution dose. Renal excretion of itraconazole and the active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole account for less than 1% of an intravenous dose. Based on an oral radiolabeled dose, fecal excretion of unchanged drug ranges from 3% to 18% of the dose. As re-distribution of itraconazole from keratinous tissues appears to be negligible, elimination of itraconazole from these tissues is related to epidermal regeneration. Contrary to plasma, the concentration in skin persists for 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of a 4-week treatment and in nail keratin \u2013 where itraconazole can be detected as early as 1 week after start of treatment \u2013 for at least six months after the end of a 3-month treatment period. Special Populations: Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. A pharmacokinetic study using a single 200 mg oral dose of itraconazole was conducted in three groups of patients with renal impairment (uremia: n=7; hemodialysis: n=7; and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: n=5). In uremic subjects with a mean creatinine clearance of 13 mL/min. \u00d7 1.73 m 2 , the exposure, based on AUC, was slightly reduced compared with normal population parameters. This study did not demonstrate any significant effect of hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole (T max , C max , and AUC 0 to 8h ). Plasma concentration-versus-time profiles showed wide intersubject variation in all three groups. After a single intravenous dose, the mean terminal half-lives of itraconazole in patients with mild (defined in this study as CrCl 50 to 79 mL/min), moderate (defined in this study as CrCl 20 to 49 mL/min), and severe renal impairment (defined in this study as CrCl <20 mL/min) were similar to that in healthy subjects (range of means 42 to 49 hours vs 48 hours in renally impaired patients and healthy subjects, respectively). Overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was decreased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, as compared with subjects with normal renal function. Data are not available in renally impaired patients during long-term use of itraconazole. Dialysis has no effect on the half-life or clearance of itraconazole or hydroxy-\u00aditraconazole. (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Hepatic Impairment: Itraconazole is predominantly metabolized in the liver. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 6 healthy and 12 cirrhotic subjects who were administered a single 100 mg dose of itraconazole as capsule. A statistically significant reduction in mean C max (47%) and a twofold increase in the elimination half-life (37\u00b117 hours vs. 16\u00b15 hours) of itraconazole were noted in cirrhotic subjects compared with healthy subjects. However, overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Data are not available in cirrhotic patients during long-term use of itraconazole. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Decreased Cardiac Contractility: When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, itraconazole should be discontinued.

      "MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action: In vitro studies have demonstrated that itraconazole inhibits the cytochrome P450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. Antimicrobial Activity: Itraconazole exhibits in vitro activity against Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Histoplasma duboisii, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Trichophyton species (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Description of Clinical Studies). Susceptibility Testing Methods: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC. Resistance: Isolates from several fungal species with decreased susceptibility to itraconazole have been isolated in vitro and from patients receiving prolonged therapy. Itraconazole is not active against Zygomycetes (e.g., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Mucor spp. and Absidia spp.), Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp. Cross-Resistance: Several in vitro studies have reported that some fungal clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility to one azole antifungal agent may also be less susceptible to other azole derivatives. The finding of cross-resistance is dependent on a number of factors, including the species evaluated, its clinical history, the particular azole compounds compared, and the type of susceptibility test that is performed. Studies (both in vitro and in vivo ) suggest that the activity of amphotericin B may be suppressed by prior azole antifungal therapy. As with other azoles, itraconazole inhibits the 14 C-demethylation step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a cell wall component of fungi. Ergosterol is the active site for amphotericin B. In one study the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatus infections in mice was inhibited by ketoconazole therapy. The clinical significance of test results obtained in this study is unknown."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Itraconazole capsules are indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients: 1. Blastomycosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary 2. Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non-meningeal histoplasmosis, and 3. Aspergillosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, in patients who are intolerant of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy. Specimens for fungal cultures and other relevant laboratory studies (wet mount, histopathology, serology) should be obtained before therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, antiinfective therapy should be adjusted accordingly. Itraconazole capsules are also indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients: 1. Onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium), and 2. Onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium). Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing (KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information.) Description of Clinical Studies: Blastomycosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=73 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status. The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 6 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of blastomycosis compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=34 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status (not including HIV-infected patients). The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 12 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of histoplasmosis, compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients: Data from a small number of HIV-infected patients suggested that the response rate of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is similar to that of non-HIV-infected patients. The clinical course of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is more severe and usually requires maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Aspergillosis: Analyses were conducted on data from an open-label, \u201csingle-patient-use\u201d protocol designed to make itraconazole available in the U.S. for patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy (N=190). The findings were corroborated by two smaller open-label studies (N=31 combined) in the same patient population. Most adult patients were treated with a daily dose of 200 to 400 mg, with a median duration of 3 months. Results of these studies demonstrated substantial evidence of effectiveness of itraconazole as a second-line therapy for the treatment of aspergillosis compared with the natural history of the disease in patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy. Onychomycosis of the toenail: Analyses were conducted on data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (N=214 total; 110 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the toenails received 200 mg of itraconazole capsules once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Results of these studies demonstrated mycologic cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 54% of patients. Thirty-five percent (35%) of patients were considered an overall success (mycologic cure plus clear or minimal nail involvement with significantly decreased signs) and 14% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure (clearance of all signs, with or without residual nail deformity). The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months. Twenty-one percent (21%) of the overall success group had a relapse (worsening of the global score or conversion of KOH or culture from negative to positive). Onychomycosis of the fingernail: Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N=73 total; 37 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without itraconazole, which was followed by a second 1-week course of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent (56%) of patients were considered an overall success and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Congestive Heart Failure: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. (See BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions-Calcium Channel Blockers, ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations.) Drug Interactions: Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole. Some examples of drugs for which plasma concentrations increase are: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor, finerenone, voclosporin. In addition, coadministration with colchicine, fesoterodine and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, and coadministration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples.) This increase in drug concentrations caused by coadministration with itraconazole may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes , a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Some specific examples are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. Coadministration with venetoclax is contraindicated in patients with CLL/SLL during the dose initiation and ramp-up phase of venetoclax due to the potential for an increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole is contraindicated for patients who have shown hypersensitivity to itraconazole. There is limited information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between itraconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing itraconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hepatic Effects: Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Continued itraconazole use or reinstitution of treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS.) Cardiac Dysrhythmias: Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with itraconazole and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with itraconazole is contraindicated. (See BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) Cardiac Disease: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. Itraconazole capsules should not be used for other indications in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. For patients with risk factors for congestive heart failure, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of itraconazole therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Such patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF, should be treated with caution, and should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, discontinue administration. Itraconazole has been shown to have a negative inotropic effect. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. Itraconazole has been associated with reports of congestive heart failure. In postmarketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving a total daily dose of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses. Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of itraconazole and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated. Cases of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the postmarketing period among patients being treated for onychomycosis and/or systemic fungal infections. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information.) Pseudoaldosteronism: Pseudoaldosteronism, manifested by the onset of hypertension or worsening of hypertension, and abnormal laboratory findings (hypokalemia, low serum renin and aldosterone, and elevated 11-deoxycortisol), has been reported with itraconazole use in the postmarketing setting. Monitor blood pressure and potassium levels and manage as necessary. Management of pseudoaldosteronism may include discontinuation of itraconazole, substitution with an appropriate antifungal drug that is not associated with pseudoaldosteronism, or use of aldosterone receptor antagonists. Interaction Potential: Itraconazole has a potential for clinically important drug interactions. Coadministration of specific drugs with itraconazole may result in changes in efficacy of itraconazole and/or the coadministered drug, life-threatening effects and/or sudden death. Drugs that are contraindicated, not recommended or recommended for use with caution in combination with itraconazole are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. Interchangeability: Itraconazole capsules and itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably. This is because drug exposure is greater with the oral solution than with the capsules when the same dose of drug is given. In addition, the topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the two formulations. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS GENERAL PRECAUTIONS Itraconazole capsules should be administered after a full meal. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). Hepatotoxicity: Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with itraconazole treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving itraconazole. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction. Neuropathy: If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to itraconazole capsules, the treatment should be discontinued. Immunocompromised Patients: In some immunocompromised patients (e.g., neutropenic, AIDS or organ transplant patients), the oral bioavailability of itraconazole capsules may be decreased. Therefore, the dose should be adjusted based on the clinical response in these patients. Cystic Fibrosis: If a cystic fibrosis patient does not respond to itraconazole capsules, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. For more information concerning the use of itraconazole in cystic fibrosis patients see the prescribing information for itraconazole oral solution. Hearing Loss: Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS \u2022 The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the itraconazole capsules and oral solution. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole oral solution. \u2022 Instruct patients to take itraconazole capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. \u2022 Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. \u2022 Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. \u2022 Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. \u2022 Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. \u2022 Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines. DRUG INTERACTIONS Effect of Itraconazole Capsules on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes , respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. Table 1 lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but it is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential, and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole. Table 1: Drug Interactions with Itraconazole that Affect Concomitant Drug Concentrations * CYP3A4 inhibitors (including itraconazole) may increase systemic contraceptive hormone concentrations. a Based on clinical drug interaction information with itraconazole. b Based on 400 mg bedaquiline once daily for 2 weeks. c EMs: extensive metabolizers; IMs: intermediate metabolizers, PMs: poor metabolizers Effect of Other Drugs on Itraconazole Itraconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole. Some concomitant drugs have the potential to interact with itraconazole resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of itraconazole. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with itraconazole. Decreased concentrations may reduce itraconazole efficacy. Table 2 lists examples of drugs that may affect itraconazole concentrations, but is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 2 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole. Table 2: Drug Interactions with Other Drugs that Affect Itraconazole Concentrations a Based on clinical drug interaction information with itraconazole. Pediatric Population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. table 1 table 2 CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 400 mg/day based on body surface area comparisons). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation ( Drosophila melanogaster ) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). PREGNANCY Teratogenic Effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 to 160 mg/kg/day (1 to 4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During postmarketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience.) NURSING MOTHERS Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants. PEDIATRIC USE The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD of 400 mg based on body surface area comparisons). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats. GERIATRIC USE Clinical studies of itraconazole capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). HIV-Infected Patients: Because hypochlorhydria has been reported in HIV-infected individuals, the absorption of itraconazole in these patients may be decreased. Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. The exposure of itraconazole may be lower in some patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when itraconazole is administered in this patient population and dose adjustment may be needed. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. It is recommended that patients with impaired hepatic function be carefully monitored when taking itraconazole. It is recommended that the prolonged elimination half-life of itraconazole observed in the single oral dose clinical trial with itraconazole capsules in cirrhotic patients be considered when deciding to initiate therapy with other medications metabolized by CYP3A4. In patients with elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be done in patients with pre\u00ad-existing hepatic function abnormalities or those who have experienced liver toxicity with other medications.

      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Itraconazole capsules should be taken with a full meal to ensure maximal absorption. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. Itraconazole capsules are a different preparation than itraconazole oral solution and should not be used interchangeably. Treatment of Blastomycosis and Histoplasmosis: The recommended dose is 200 mg once daily (2 capsules). If there is no obvious improvement, or there is evidence of progressive fungal disease, the dose should be increased in 100-mg increments to a maximum of 400 mg daily. Doses above 200 mg/day should be given in two divided doses. Treatment of Aspergillosis: A daily dose of 200 to 400 mg is recommended. Treatment in Life-Threatening Situations: In life-threatening situations, a loading dose should be used. Although clinical studies did not provide for a loading dose, it is recommended, based on pharmacokinetic data, that a loading dose of 200 mg (2 capsules) three times daily (600 mg/day) be given for the first 3 days of treatment. Treatment should be continued for a minimum of three months and until clinical parameters and laboratory tests indicate that the active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Itraconazole capsules and itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Treatment of Onychomycosis: Toenails with or without fingernail involvement: The recommended dose is 200 mg (2 capsules) once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Treatment of Onychomycosis: Fingernails only: The recommended dosing regimen is 2 treatment courses, each consisting of 200 mg (2 capsules) b.i.d. (400 mg/day) for 1 week. The courses are separated by a 3-week period without itraconazole capsules.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following oral administration. As a consequence of non-linear pharmacokinetics, itraconazole accumulates in plasma during multiple dosing. Steady-state concentrations are generally reached within about 15 days, with C max values of 0.5 \u00b5g/mL, 1.1 \u00b5g/mL and 2.0 \u00b5g/mL after oral administration of 100 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily and 200 mg b.i.d., respectively. The terminal half-life of itraconazole generally ranges from 16 to 28 hours after single dose and increases to 34 to 42 hours with repeated dosing. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. Itraconazole mean total plasma clearance following intravenous administration is 278 mL/min. Itraconazole clearance decreases at higher doses due to saturable hepatic metabolism. Absorption Itraconazole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following an oral capsule dose. The observed absolute oral bioavailability of itraconazole is about 55%. The oral bioavailability of itraconazole is maximal when itraconazole capsules are taken immediately after a full meal. Absorption of itraconazole capsules is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g., H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) Absorption of itraconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when itraconazole capsules are administered with an acidic beverage (such as a non-diet cola). When itraconazole capsules were administered as a single 200-mg dose under fasted conditions with non-diet cola after ranitidine pretreatment, a H 2 -receptor antagonist, itraconazole absorption was comparable to that observed when itraconazole capsules were administered alone. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) Itraconazole exposure is lower with the Capsule formulation than with the Oral Solution when the same dose of drug is given. (See WARNINGS.) Distribution Most of the itraconazole in plasma is bound to protein (99.8%), with albumin being the main binding component (99.6% for the hydroxy-metabolite). It has also a marked affinity for lipids. Only 0.2% of the itraconazole in plasma is present as free drug. Itraconazole is distributed in a large apparent volume in the body (>700 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Concentrations in lung, kidney, liver, bone, stomach, spleen and muscle were found to be two to three times higher than corresponding concentrations in plasma, and the uptake into keratinous tissues, skin in particular, up to four times higher. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are much lower than in plasma. Metabolism Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into a large number of metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of itraconazole. The main metabolite is hydroxy-itraconazole, which has in vitro antifungal activity comparable to itraconazole; trough plasma concentrations of this metabolite are about twice those of itraconazole. Excretion Itraconazole is excreted mainly as inactive metabolites in urine (35%) and in feces (54%) within one week of an oral solution dose. Renal excretion of itraconazole and the active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole account for less than 1% of an intravenous dose. Based on an oral radiolabeled dose, fecal excretion of unchanged drug ranges from 3% to 18% of the dose. As re-distribution of itraconazole from keratinous tissues appears to be negligible, elimination of itraconazole from these tissues is related to epidermal regeneration. Contrary to plasma, the concentration in skin persists for 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of a 4-week treatment and in nail keratin \u2013 where itraconazole can be detected as early as 1 week after start of treatment \u2013 for at least six months after the end of a 3-month treatment period. Special Populations: Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. A pharmacokinetic study using a single 200 mg oral dose of itraconazole was conducted in three groups of patients with renal impairment (uremia: n=7; hemodialysis: n=7; and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: n=5). In uremic subjects with a mean creatinine clearance of 13 mL/min. \u00d7 1.73 m 2 , the exposure, based on AUC, was slightly reduced compared with normal population parameters. This study did not demonstrate any significant effect of hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole (T max , C max , and AUC 0 to 8h ). Plasma concentration-versus-time profiles showed wide intersubject variation in all three groups. After a single intravenous dose, the mean terminal half-lives of itraconazole in patients with mild (defined in this study as CrCl 50 to 79 mL/min), moderate (defined in this study as CrCl 20 to 49 mL/min), and severe renal impairment (defined in this study as CrCl <20 mL/min) were similar to that in healthy subjects (range of means 42 to 49 hours vs 48 hours in renally impaired patients and healthy subjects, respectively). Overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was decreased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, as compared with subjects with normal renal function. Data are not available in renally impaired patients during long-term use of itraconazole. Dialysis has no effect on the half-life or clearance of itraconazole or hydroxy-itraconazole. (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Hepatic Impairment: Itraconazole is predominantly metabolized in the liver. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 6 healthy and 12 cirrhotic subjects who were administered a single 100 mg dose of itraconazole as capsule. A statistically significant reduction in mean C max (47%) and a twofold increase in the elimination half-life (37 \u00b1 17 hours vs. 16 \u00b1 5 hours) of itraconazole were noted in cirrhotic subjects compared with healthy subjects. However, overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Data are not available in cirrhotic patients during long-term use of itraconazole. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Decreased Cardiac Contractility: When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, itraconazole should be discontinued. (See BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information.) MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action: In vitro studies have demonstrated that itraconazole inhibits the cytochrome P450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. Antimicrobial Activity: Itraconazole exhibits in vitro activity against Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Histoplasma duboisii, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Trichophyton species (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Description of Clinical Studies). Susceptibility Testing Methods: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC. Resistance: Isolates from several fungal species with decreased susceptibility to itraconazole have been isolated in vitro and from patients receiving prolonged therapy. Itraconazole is not active against Zygomycetes (e.g., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Mucor spp. and Absidia spp.), Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp. Cross-Resistance: Several in vitro studies have reported that some fungal clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility to one azole antifungal agent may also be less susceptible to other azole derivatives. The finding of cross-resistance is dependent on a number of factors, including the species evaluated, its clinical history, the particular azole compounds compared, and the type of susceptibility test that is performed. Studies (both in vitro and in vivo ) suggest that the activity of amphotericin B may be suppressed by prior azole antifungal therapy. As with other azoles, itraconazole inhibits the 14 C-demethylation step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a cell wall component of fungi. Ergosterol is the active site for amphotericin B. In one study the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatus infections in mice was inhibited by ketoconazole therapy. The clinical significance of test results obtained in this study is unknown."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Itraconazole capsules are indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients: Blastomycosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non-meningeal histoplasmosis, and Aspergillosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, in patients who are intolerant of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy. Specimens for fungal cultures and other relevant laboratory studies (wet mount, histopathology, serology) should be obtained before therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, antiinfective therapy should be adjusted accordingly. Itraconazole capsules are also indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients: Onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium), and Onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium). Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing (KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information.) Description of Clinical Studies: Blastomycosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=73 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status. The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 6 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of blastomycosis compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=34 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status (not including HIV-infected patients). The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 12 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of histoplasmosis, compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients: Data from a small number of HIV-infected patients suggested that the response rate of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is similar to that of non-HIV-infected patients. The clinical course of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is more severe and usually requires maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Aspergillosis: Analyses were conducted on data from an open-label, \"single-patient-use\" protocol designed to make itraconazole available in the U.S. for patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy (N=190). The findings were corroborated by two smaller open-label studies (N=31 combined) in the same patient population. Most adult patients were treated with a daily dose of 200 to 400 mg, with a median duration of 3 months. Results of these studies demonstrated substantial evidence of effectiveness of itraconazole as a second-line therapy for the treatment of aspergillosis compared with the natural history of the disease in patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy. Onychomycosis of the toenail: Analyses were conducted on data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (N=214 total; 110 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the toenails received 200 mg of itraconazole capsules once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Results of these studies demonstrated mycologic cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 54% of patients. Thirty-five percent (35%) of patients were considered an overall success (mycologic cure plus clear or minimal nail involvement with significantly decreased signs) and 14% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure (clearance of all signs, with or without residual nail deformity). The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months. Twenty-one percent (21%) of the overall success group had a relapse (worsening of the global score or conversion of KOH or culture from negative to positive). Onychomycosis of the fingernail: Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N=73 total; 37 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without itraconazole, which was followed by a second 1-week course of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent (56%) of patients were considered an overall success and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Congestive Heart Failure: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. (See BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions-Calcium Channel Blockers, ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations.) Drug Interactions: Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole. Some examples of drugs for which plasma concentrations increase are: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor, finerenone, voclosporin. In addition, coadministration with colchicine, fesoterodine and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, and coadministration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples.) This increase in drug concentrations caused by coadministration with itraconazole may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes , a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Some specific examples are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. Coadministration with venetoclax is contraindicated in patients with CLL/SLL during the dose initiation and ramp-up phase of venetoclax due to the potential for an increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole is contraindicated for patients who have shown hypersensitivity to itraconazole. There is limited information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between itraconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing itraconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hepatic Effects: Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Continued itraconazole use or reinstitution of treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS.) Cardiac Dysrhythmias: Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with itraconazole and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with itraconazole is contraindicated. (See BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) Cardiac Disease: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. Itraconazole capsules should not be used for other indications in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. For patients with risk factors for congestive heart failure, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of itraconazole therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Such patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF, should be treated with caution, and should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, discontinue administration. Itraconazole has been shown to have a negative inotropic effect. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. Itraconazole has been associated with reports of congestive heart failure. In post-marketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving a total daily dose of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses. Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of itraconazole and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated. Cases of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the post-marketing period among patients being treated for onychomycosis and/or systemic fungal infections. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information.) Pseudoaldosteronism: Pseudoaldosteronism, manifested by the onset of hypertension or worsening of hypertension, and abnormal laboratory findings (hypokalemia, low serum renin and aldosterone, and elevated 11-deoxycortisol), has been reported with itraconazole use in the postmarketing setting. Monitor blood pressure and potassium levels and manage as necessary. Management of pseudoaldosteronism may include discontinuation of itraconazole, substitution with an appropriate antifungal drug that is not associated with pseudoaldosteronism, or use of aldosterone receptor antagonists. Interaction Potential: Itraconazole has a potential for clinically important drug interactions. Coadministration of specific drugs with itraconazole may result in changes in efficacy of itraconazole and/or the coadministered drug, life-threatening effects and/or sudden death. Drugs that are contraindicated, not recommended or recommended for use with caution in combination with itraconazole are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. Interchangeability: Itraconazole capsules and itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably. This is because drug exposure is greater with the oral solution than with the capsules when the same dose of drug is given. In addition, the topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the two formulations. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Itraconazole capsules should be administered after a full meal. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). Hepatotoxicity: Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with itraconazole treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving itraconazole. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction. Neuropathy: If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to itraconazole capsules, the treatment should be discontinued. Immunocompromised Patients: In some immunocompromised patients (e.g., neutropenic, AIDS or organ transplant patients), the oral bioavailability of itraconazole capsules may be decreased. Therefore, the dose should be adjusted based on the clinical response in these patients. Cystic Fibrosis: If a cystic fibrosis patient does not respond to itraconazole capsules, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. For more information concerning the use of itraconazole in cystic fibrosis patients see the prescribing information for itraconazole oral solution. Hearing Loss: Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Information for Patients: The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the itraconazole capsules and oral solution. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole oral solution. Instruct patients to take itraconazole capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines. Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole Capsules on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. Table 1 lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but it is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential, and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole. Some concomitant drugs have the potential to interact with itraconazole resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of itraconazole. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with itraconazole. Decreased concentrations may reduce itraconazole efficacy. Table 2 lists examples of drugs that may affect itraconazole concentrations, but is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 2 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

Miscellaneous Drugs and Other Substances Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor Not recommended 2 weeks before, during, and 2 weeks after itraconazole treatment. a Based on clinical drug interaction information with itraconazole. Pediatric Population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 400 mg/day based on body surface area comparisons). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation ( Drosophila melanogaster ) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 to 160 mg/kg/day (1 to 4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During postmarketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience.) Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants. Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD of 400 mg based on body surface area comparisons). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). HIV-Infected Patients: Because hypochlorhydria has been reported in HIV-infected individuals, the absorption of itraconazole in these patients may be decreased. Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. The exposure of itraconazole may be lower in some patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when itraconazole is administered in this patient population and dose adjustment may be needed. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. It is recommended that patients with impaired hepatic function be carefully monitored when taking itraconazole. It is recommended that the prolonged elimination half-life of itraconazole observed in the single oral dose clinical trial with itraconazole capsules in cirrhotic patients be considered when deciding to initiate therapy with other medications metabolized by CYP3A4. In patients with elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be done in patients with pre-existing hepatic function abnormalities or those who have experienced liver toxicity with other medications.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of itraconazole use should be reassessed. (See WARNINGS: Hepatic Effects and PRECAUTIONS: Hepatotoxicity and Information for Patients.) Adverse Events in the Treatment of Systemic Fungal Infections Adverse event data were derived from 602 patients treated for systemic fungal disease in U.S. clinical trials who were immunocompromised or receiving multiple concomitant medications. Treatment was discontinued in 10.5% of patients due to adverse events. The median duration before discontinuation of therapy was 81 days (range: 2 to 776 days). The table lists adverse events reported by at least 1% of patients. Table 3: Clinical Trials of Systemic Fungal Infections: Adverse Events Occurring with an Incidence of Greater than or Equal to 1% *Rash tends to occur more frequently in immunocompromised patients receiving immunosuppressive medications. Body System/Adverse Event Incidence (%) (N=602) Gastrointestinal Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Abdominal Pain Anorexia 11 5 3 2 1 Body as a Whole Edema Fatigue Fever Malaise 4 3 3 1 Skin and Appendages Rash* Pruritus 9 3 Central/Peripheral Nervous System Headache Dizziness 4 2 Psychiatric Libido Decreased Somnolence 1 1 Cardiovascular Hypertension 3 Metabolic/Nutritional Hypokalemia 2 Urinary System Albuminuria 1 Liver and Biliary System Hepatic Function Abnormal 3 Reproductive System, Male Impotence 1 Adverse events infrequently reported in all studies included constipation, gastritis, depression, insomnia, tinnitus, menstrual disorder, adrenal insufficiency, gynecomastia, and male breast pain. Adverse Events Reported in Toenail Onychomycosis Clinical Trials Patients in these trials were on a continuous dosing regimen of 200 mg once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. The following adverse events led to temporary or permanent discontinuation of therapy. Table 4: Clinical Trials of Onychomycosis of the Toenail: Adverse Events Leading to Temporary or Permanent Discontinuation of Therapy Adverse Event Incidence (%) Itraconazole (N=112) Elevated Liver Enzymes (greater than twice the upper limit of normal) 4 Gastrointestinal Disorders 4 Rash 3 Hypertension 2 Orthostatic Hypotension 1 Headache 1 Malaise 1 Myalgia 1 Vasculitis 1 Vertigo 1 The following adverse events occurred with an incidence of greater than or equal to 1% (N=112): headache: 10%; rhinitis: 9%; upper respiratory tract infection: 8%; sinusitis, injury: 7%; diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, abdominal pain, dizziness, rash: 4%; cystitis, urinary tract infection, liver function abnormality, myalgia, nausea: 3%; appetite increased, constipation, gastritis, gastroenteritis, pharyngitis, asthenia, fever, pain, tremor, herpes zoster, abnormal dreaming: 2%. Adverse Events Reported in Fingernail Onychomycosis Clinical Trials Patients in these trials were on a dosing regimen consisting of two 1-week treatment periods of 200 mg twice daily, separated by a 3-week period without drug. The following adverse events led to temporary or permanent discontinuation of therapy. Table 5: Clinical Trials of Onychomycosis of the Fingernail: Adverse Events Leading to Temporary or Permanent Discontinuation of Therapy Adverse Event Incidence (%) Itraconazole (N=37) Rash/Pruritus 3 Hypertriglyceridemia 3 The following adverse events occurred with an incidence of greater than or equal to 1% (N=37): headache: 8%; pruritus, nausea, rhinitis: 5%; rash, bursitis, anxiety, depression, constipation, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, ulcerative stomatitis, gingivitis, hypertriglyceridemia, sinusitis, fatigue, malaise, pain, injury: 3%. Adverse Events Reported from Other Clinical Trials In addition, the following adverse drug reaction was reported in patients who participated in itraconazole capsules clinical trials: Hepatobiliary Disorders: hyperbilirubinemia. The following is a list of additional adverse drug reactions associated with itraconazole that have been reported in clinical trials of itraconazole oral solution and itraconazole IV excluding the adverse reaction term \"Injection site inflammation\" which is specific to the injection route of administration: Cardiac Disorders: cardiac failure, left ventricular failure, tachycardia; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: face edema, chest pain, chills; Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatic failure, jaundice; Investigations: alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, blood urea increased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, urine analysis abnormal; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia; Psychiatric Disorders: confusional state; Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal impairment; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: dysphonia, cough; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash erythematous, hyperhidrosis; Vascular Disorders: hypotension Postmarketing Experience Adverse drug reactions that have been first identified during postmarketing experience with itraconazole(all formulations) are listed in the table below. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, reliably estimating their frequency or establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is not always possible. Table 6: Postmarketing Reports of Adverse Drug Reactions Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia Immune System Disorders: Anaphylaxis; anaphylactic, anaphylactoid and allergic reactions; serum sickness; angioneurotic edema Endocrine Disorders: Pseudoaldosteronism Nervous System Disorders: Peripheral neuropathy, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, tremor Eye Disorders: Visual disturbances, including vision blurred and diplopia Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Transient or permanent hearing loss Cardiac Disorders: Congestive heart failure, bradycardia Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Pulmonary edema, dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis, dysgeusia Hepatobiliary Disorders: Serious hepatotoxicity (including some cases of fatal acute liver failure), hepatitis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, alopecia, photosensitivity, urticaria Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Arthralgia Renal and Urinary Disorders: Urinary incontinence, pollakiuria Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Erectile dysfunction General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Peripheral edema Investigations: Blood creatine phosphokinase increased There is limited information on the use of itraconazole during pregnancy. Cases of congenital abnormalities including skeletal, genitourinary tract, cardiovascular and ophthalmic malformations as well as chromosomal and multiple malformations have been reported during post-marketing experience. A causal relationship with itraconazole has not been established.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Itraconazole capsules should be taken with a full meal to ensure maximal absorption. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. Itraconazole capsules are a different preparation than itraconazole oral solution and should not be used interchangeably. Treatment of Blastomycosis and Histoplasmosis: The recommended dose is 200 mg once daily (2 capsules). If there is no obvious improvement, or there is evidence of progressive fungal disease, the dose should be increased in 100-mg increments to a maximum of 400 mg daily. Doses above 200 mg/day should be given in two divided doses. Treatment of Aspergillosis: A daily dose of 200 to 400 mg is recommended. Treatment in Life-Threatening Situations: In life-threatening situations, a loading dose should be used. Although clinical studies did not provide for a loading dose, it is recommended, based on pharmacokinetic data, that a loading dose of 200 mg (2 capsules) three times daily (600 mg/day) be given for the first 3 days of treatment. Treatment should be continued for a minimum of three months and until clinical parameters and laboratory tests indicate that the active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Itraconazole capsules and itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Treatment of Onychomycosis: Toenails with or without fingernail involvement: The recommended dose is 200 mg (2 capsules) once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Treatment of Onychomycosis: Fingernails only: The recommended dosing regimen is 2 treatment courses, each consisting of 200 mg (2 capsules) b.i.d. (400 mg/day) for 1 week. The courses are separated by a 3-week period without itraconazole capsules. Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and PRECAUTIONS.)

      "BOXED WARNING Congestive Heart Failure, Cardiac Effects and Drug Interactions: If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure occur during administration of itraconazole oral solution, continued itraconazole use should be reassessed. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to dogs and healthy human volunteers, negative inotropic effects were seen. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS ). Drug Interactions, ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations for more information.) Drug Interactions: Coadministration of the following drugs are contraindicated with itraconazole oral solution: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor. In addition, coadministration with colchicine, fesoterodine and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, and coadministration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors. See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples. Coadministration with itraconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS Sections, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Itraconazole, an azole antifungal agent. Itraconazole is a 1:1:1:1 racemic mixture of four diastereomers (two enantiomeric pairs), each possessing three chiral centers. It may be represented by the following structural formula and nomenclature: (\u00b1)-1-sec-Butyl-4-[p-[4-[p-[[2R*,4S*)-2-(2,4-dichloro phenyl)-2-(1H-1, 2, 4-triazol-1 ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4 yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenyl]-\u0394 2 -1, 2, 4-triazolin-5-one or 4-[4-[4-[4-[[Cis-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy] phenyl]piperazin1-yl] phenyl]-2-[(1RS)-1-methyl propyl]-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one Itraconazole has a molecular formula of C 35 H 38 Cl 2 N 8 O 4 and a molecular weight of 705.63. It is a white or almost white powder. It is freely soluble in methylene chloride, sparingly soluble in tetrahydrofuran, very slightly soluble in alcohol, practically insoluble in water. It has a pKa of 3.70 (based on extrapolation of values obtained from methanolic solutions) and a log (n-octanol/aq. Buffer of pH: 8.1) partition coefficient of 5.66 at pH 8.1. Itraconazole oral solution contains 10 mg of itraconazole USP per mL, solubilized by hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (400 mg/mL) as a molecular inclusion complex. Itraconazole oral solution is clear, colorless to yellowish brown liquid with a target pH of 2. Other ingredients are ascorbic acid, hydrochloric acid, propylene glycol, purified water, non crystallizing sorbitol solution, saccharin sodium, sodium hydroxide, ART Cherry flavor.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Itraconazole General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 2.5 hours following administration of the oral solution. As a consequence of non-linear pharmacokinetics, itraconazole accumulates in plasma during multiple dosing. Steadystate concentrations are generally reached within about 15 days, with C max and AUC values 4 to 7-fold higher than those seen after a single dose. Steady-state C max values of about 2 mcg/mL are reached after oral administration of 200 mg once daily. The terminal half-life of itraconazole generally ranges from 16 to 28 hours after single dose and increases to 34 to 42 hours with repeated dosing. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. Itraconazole mean total plasma clearance following intravenous administration is 278 mL/min. Itraconazole clearance decreases at higher doses due to saturable hepatic metabolism. Absorption Itraconazole is rapidly absorbed after administration of the oral solution. Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2.5 hours following administration of the oral solution under fasting conditions. The observed absolute bioavailability of itraconazole under fed conditions is about 55% and increases by 30% when the oral solution is taken in fasting conditions. Itraconazole exposure is greater with the oral solution than with the capsule formulation when the same dose of drug is given. (see WARNINGS ) Distribution Most of the itraconazole in plasma is bound to protein (99.8%), with albumin being the main binding component (99.6% for the hydroxy-metabolite). It has also a marked affinity for lipids. Only 0.2% of the itraconazole in plasma is present as free drug. Itraconazole is distributed in a large apparent volume in the body (>700 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Concentrations in lung, kidney, liver, bone, stomach, spleen and muscle were found to be two to three times higher than corresponding concentrations in plasma, and the uptake into keratinous tissues, skin in particular, up to four times higher. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are much lower than in plasma. Metabolism Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into a large number of metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of itraconazole. The main metabolite is hydroxy-itraconazole, which has in vitro antifungal activity comparable to itraconazole; trough plasma concentrations of this metabolite are about twice those of itraconazole. Excretion Itraconazole is excreted mainly as inactive metabolites in urine (35%) and in feces (54%) within one week of an oral solution dose. Renal excretion of itraconazole and the active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole account for less than 1% of an intravenous dose. Based on an oral radiolabeled dose, fecal excretion of unchanged drug ranges from 3% to 18% of the dose."

      "Special Populations: Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. A pharmacokinetic study using a single 200 mg oral dose of itraconazole was conducted in three groups of patients with renal impairment (uremia: n = 7; hemodialysis: n = 7; and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: n = 5). In uremic subjects with a mean creatinine clearance of 13 mL/min.\u00d71.73 m 2 , the exposure, based on AUC, was slightly reduced compared with normal population parameters. This study did not demonstrate any significant effect of hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole (T max , C max , and AUC 0 to 8h ). Plasma concentration-versus-time profiles showed wide intersubject variation in all three groups. After a single intravenous dose, the mean terminal half-lives of itraconazole in patients with mild (defined in this study as CrCl 50 to 79 mL/min), moderate (defined in this study as CrCl 20 to 49 mL/min), and severe renal impairment (defined in this study as CrCl <20 mL/min) were similar to that in healthy subjects (range of means 42 to 49 hours vs 48 hours in renally impaired patients and healthy subjects, respectively). Overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was decreased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, as compared with subjects with normal renal function. Data are not available in renally impaired patients during long-term use of itraconazole. Dialysis has no effect on the half-life or clearance of itraconazole or hydroxy-itraconazole. (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Hepatic Impairment: Itraconazole is predominantly metabolized in the liver. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 6 healthy and 12 cirrhotic subjects who were administered a single 100 mg dose of itraconazole as capsule. A statistically significant reduction in mean C max (47%) and a twofold increase in the elimination half-life (37 \u00b1 17 hours vs. 16 \u00b1 5 hours) of itraconazole were noted in cirrhotic subjects compared with healthy subjects. However, overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Data are not available in chornic patients during long-term use of itraconazole. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Decreased Cardiac Contractility: When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure appear during administration of itraconazole oral solution, monitor carefully and consider other treatment alternatives which may include discontinuation of itraconazole oral solution administration. (See BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience for more information .) Cystic Fibrosis: Seventeen cystic fibrosis patients, ages 7 to 28 years old, were administered itraconazole oral solution 2.5 mg/kg b.i.d. for 14 days in a pharmacokinetic study. Sixteen patients completed the study. Steady state trough concentrations >250 ng/mL were achieved in 6 out of 11 patients \u00b316 years of age but in none of the 5 patients <16 years of age. Large variability was observed in the pharmacokinetic data (%CV for trough concentrations = 98% and 70% for \u00b316 and <16 years, respectively; %CV for AUC = 75% and 58% for \u00b316 and <16 years, respectively). If a patient with cystic fibrosis does not respond to itraconazole oral solution, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-Cyclodextrin: The oral bioavailability of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin given as a solubilizer of itraconazole in oral solution is on average lower than 0.5% and is similar to that of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin alone. This low oral bioavailability of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin is not modified by the presence of food and is similar after single and repeated administrations."

      "MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action: In vitro studies have demonstrated that itraconazole inhibits the cytochrome P450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. Antimicrobial Activity: Itraconazole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganism, both in vitro and in clinical infections. Candida albicans Susceptibility Testing Methods: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC. Drug Resistance: Isolates from several fungal species with decreased susceptibility to itraconazole have been isolated in vitro and from patients receiving prolonged therapy. Candida krusei, Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis are generally the least susceptible Candida species, with some isolates showing unequivocal resistance to itraconazole in vitro. Itraconazole is not active against Zygomycetes (e.g., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Mucor spp. and Absidia spp.), Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp. Cross-resistance: In systemic candidosis, if fluconazole-resistant strains of Candida species are suspected, it cannot be assumed that these are sensitive to itraconazole, hence their sensitivity should be tested before the start of itraconazole therapy. Several in vitro studies have reported that some fungal clinical isolates, including Candida species, with reduced susceptibility to one azole antifungal agent may also be less susceptible to other azole derivatives. The finding of cross-resistance is dependent on a number of factors, including the species evaluated, its clinical history, the particular azole compounds compared, and the type of susceptibility test that is performed. Studies (both in vitro and in vivo ) suggest that the activity of amphotericin B may be suppressed by prior azole antifungal therapy. As with other azoles, itraconazole inhibits the 14 C-demethylation step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a cell wall component of fungi. Ergosterol is the active site for amphotericin B. In one study the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatus infections in mice was inhibited by ketoconazole therapy. The clinical significance of test results obtained in this study is unknown."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Oropharyngeal Candidiasis: Two randomized, controlled studies for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis have been conducted (total n = 344). In one trial, clinical response to either 7 or 14 days of itraconazole oral solution, 200 mg/day, was similar to fluconazole tablets and averaged 84% across all arms. Clinical response in this study was defined as cured or improved (only minimal signs and symptoms with no visible lesions). Approximately 5% of subjects were lost to follow-up before any evaluations could be performed. Response to 14 days therapy of itraconazole oral solution was associated with a lower relapse rate than 7 days of itraconazole therapy. In another trial, the clinical response rate (defined as cured or improved) for itraconazole oral solution was similar to clotrimazole troches and averaged approximately 71% across both arms, with approximately 3% of subjects lost to follow-up before any evaluations could be performed. Ninety-two percent of the patients in these studies were HIV seropositive. In an uncontrolled, open-label study of selected patients clinically unresponsive to fluconazole tablets (n = 74, all patients HIV seropositive), patients were treated with itraconazole oral solution 100 mg b.i.d. (Clinically unresponsive to fluconazole in this study was defined as having received a dose of fluconazole tablets at least 200 mg/day for a minimum of 14 days.) Treatment duration was 14 to 28 days based on response. Approximately 55% of patients had complete resolution of oral lesions. Of patients who responded and then entered a followup phase (n = 22), all relapsed within 1 month (median 14 days) when treatment was discontinued. Although baseline endoscopies had not been performed, several patients in this study developed symptoms of esophageal candidiasis while receiving therapy with itraconazole oral solution. Itraconazole oral solution has not been directly compared to other agents in a controlled trial of similar patients. Esophageal Candidiasis: A double-blind randomized study (n = 119, 111 of whom were HIV seropositive) compared itraconazole oral solution (100 mg/day) to fluconazole tablets (100 mg/day). The dose of each was increased to 200 mg/day for patients not responding initially. Treatment continued for 2 weeks following resolution of symptoms, for a total duration of treatment of 3 to 8 weeks. Clinical response (a global assessment of cured or improved) was not significantly different between the two study arms, and averaged approximately 86% with 8% lost to follow-up. Six of 53 (11%) itraconazole-treated patients and 12/57 (21%) fluconazole-treated patients were escalated to the 200 mg dose in this trial. Of the subgroup of patients who responded and entered a follow-up phase (n = 88), approximately 23% relapsed across both arms within 4 weeks."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Congestive Heart Failure: Itraconazole oral solution should not be administered to patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF except for the treatment of life-threatening or other serious infections. (See BOXED WARNING , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions-Calcium Channel Blockers , ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience , and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations .) Drug Interactions: Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole. Plasma concentrations increase for the following drugs: levaceytlmethadol (levomethadyl), methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor. In addition, coadministration with colchicine, fesoterodine, and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, and coadministration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples.) This increase in drug concentrations caused by coadministration with itraconazole may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Specific examples are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions . Itraconazole is contraindicated for patients who have shown hypersensitivity to itraconazole. There is limited information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between itraconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing itraconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles."

      "WARNINGS Hepatic Effects: Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Continued itraconazole use or reinstitution of treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Cardiac Dysrhythmias: Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with itraconazole and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with itraconazole oral solution is contraindicated. (See BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Cardiac Disease: Itraconazole oral solution should not be used in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. For patients with risk factors for congestive heart failure, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of itraconazole therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Such patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF, should be treated with caution, and should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear during administration of itraconazole oral solution, monitor carefully and consider other treatment alternatives which may include discontinuation of itraconazole oral solution administration. Itraconazole has been shown to have a negative inotropic effect. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. Itraconazole oral solution has been associated with reports of congestive heart failure. In post-marketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving a total daily dose of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses. Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of itraconazole and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated. Cases of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the post-marketing period among patients being treated for onychomycosis and/or systemic fungal infections. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information .) Interaction potential: Itraconazole has a potential for clinically important drug interactions. Coadministration of specific drugs with itraconazole may result in changes in efficacy of itraconazole and/or the coadministered drug, life-threatening effects and/or sudden death. Drugs that are contraindicated, not recommended or recommended for use with caution in combination with itraconazole are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions . Interchangeability: Itraconazole oral solution and itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably. This is because drug exposure is greater with the oral solution than with the capsules when the same dose of drug is given. Only itraconazole oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin: Itraconazole oral solution contains the excipient hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin which produced adenocarcinomas in the large intestine and exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas in a rat carcinogenicity study. These findings were not observed in a similar mouse carcinogenicity study. The clinical relevance of these adenocarcinomas is unknown. (See PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility .) Treatment of Severely Neutropenic Patients: Itraconazole oral solution as treatment for oropharyngeal and/or esophageal candidiasis was not investigated in severely neutropenic patients. Due to its pharmacokinetic properties, itraconazole oral solution is not recommended for initiation of treatment in patients at immediate risk of systemic candidiasis."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity: Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with itraconazole treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving itraconazole. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction. Neuropathy: If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to itraconazole oral solution, the treatment should be discontinued. Cystic Fibrosis: If a patient with cystic fibrosis does not respond to itraconazole oral solution, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations ). Hearing Loss: Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Information for Patients: Only itraconazole oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole oral solution contains the excipient hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin which produced adenocarcinomas in the large intestine and exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas in a rat carcinogenicity study. These findings were not observed in a similar mouse carcinogenicity study. The clinical relevance of these adenocarcinomas is unknown. (See Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility .) Taking itraconazole oral solution under fasted conditions improves the systemic availability of itraconazole. Instruct patients to take itraconazole oral solution without food, if possible. Itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole capsules. Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines. Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes, respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. The table below lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways risk potential and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 below are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

Pediatric Population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (3.1 times the MRHD) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (6.25 times the MRHD) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation ( Drosophila melanogaster ) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (20 times the MRHD). Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) is the solubilizing excipient used in itraconazole oral solution. Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) was found to produce neoplasms in the large intestine at 5,000 mg/kg/day in rat carcinogenicity study. This dose was about 6 times amount contained in the recommended clinical dose of itraconazole oral solution based on body surface area comparisons. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. The slightly higher incidence of adenocarcinomas in the large intestines was linked to the hypertrophic/hyperplastic and inflammatory changes in the colonic mucosa brought about by HP-\u03b2-CD-induced increased osmotic forces. In addition, HP-\u03b2-CD was found to produce pancreatic exocrine hyperplasia and neoplasia when administered orally to rats at doses of 500, 2,000 or 5,000 mg/kg/day for 25 months. Adenocarcinomas of the exocrine pancreas produced in the treated animals were not seen in the untreated group and are not reported in the historical controls. The recommended clinical dose of itraconazole oral solution contains approximately 1.7 times the amount of HP-\u03b2-CD as was in the 500 mg/kg/day dose, based on body surface area comparisons. This finding was not observed in the mouse carcinogenicity study at doses of 500, 2,000 or 5,000 mg/kg/day for 22 to 23 months. This finding was also not observed in a 12-month toxicity study in dogs or in a 2-year toxicity study in female cynomolgus monkeys. Since the development of the pancreatic tumors may be related to a mitogenic action of cholecystokinin and since there is no evidence that cholecystokinin has a mitogenic action in man, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. HP-\u03b2-CD has no antifertile effect, and is not mutagenic. Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 to 160 mg/kg/day (5 to 20 times the MRHD), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. Itraconazole oral solution contains the excipient hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD). HP-\u03b2-CD has no direct embryotoxic and no teratogenic effect. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During post-marketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience .) Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants. Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the MRHD). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (20 times the MRHD) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole oral solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole oral solution in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. The exposure of itraconazole may be lower in some patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when itraconazole is administered in this patient population and dose adjustment may be needed. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. It is recommended that patients with impaired hepatic function be carefully monitored when taking itraconazole. It is recommended that the prolonged elimination half-life of itraconazole observed in the single oral dose clinical trial with itraconazole capsules in cirrhotic patients be considered when deciding to initiate therapy with other medications metabolized by CYP3A4. In patients with elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be done in patients with preexisting hepatic function abnormalities or those who have experienced liver toxicity with other medications.

      "Information for Patients: Only itraconazole oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole oral solution contains the excipient hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin which produced adenocarcinomas in the large intestine and exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas in a rat carcinogenicity study. These findings were not observed in a similar mouse carcinogenicity study. The clinical relevance of these adenocarcinomas is unknown. (See Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility .) Taking itraconazole oral solution under fasted conditions improves the systemic availability of itraconazole. Instruct patients to take itraconazole oral solution without food, if possible. Itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole capsules. Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines."

    "carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility": [
      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (3.1 times the MRHD) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (6.25 times the MRHD) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation ( Drosophila melanogaster ) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (20 times the MRHD). Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) is the solubilizing excipient used in itraconazole oral solution. Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) was found to produce neoplasms in the large intestine at 5,000 mg/kg/day in rat carcinogenicity study. This dose was about 6 times amount contained in the recommended clinical dose of itraconazole oral solution based on body surface area comparisons. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. The slightly higher incidence of adenocarcinomas in the large intestines was linked to the hypertrophic/hyperplastic and inflammatory changes in the colonic mucosa brought about by HP-\u03b2-CD-induced increased osmotic forces. In addition, HP-\u03b2-CD was found to produce pancreatic exocrine hyperplasia and neoplasia when administered orally to rats at doses of 500, 2,000 or 5,000 mg/kg/day for 25 months. Adenocarcinomas of the exocrine pancreas produced in the treated animals were not seen in the untreated group and are not reported in the historical controls. The recommended clinical dose of itraconazole oral solution contains approximately 1.7 times the amount of HP-\u03b2-CD as was in the 500 mg/kg/day dose, based on body surface area comparisons. This finding was not observed in the mouse carcinogenicity study at doses of 500, 2,000 or 5,000 mg/kg/day for 22 to 23 months. This finding was also not observed in a 12-month toxicity study in dogs or in a 2-year toxicity study in female cynomolgus monkeys. Since the development of the pancreatic tumors may be related to a mitogenic action of cholecystokinin and since there is no evidence that cholecystokinin has a mitogenic action in man, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. HP-\u03b2-CD has no antifertile effect, and is not mutagenic."
    ],
    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 to 160 mg/kg/day (5 to 20 times the MRHD), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. Itraconazole oral solution contains the excipient hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD). HP-\u03b2-CD has no direct embryotoxic and no teratogenic effect. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During post-marketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience .)"

    "nursing_mothers": [
      "Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants."

    "pediatric_use": [
      "Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the MRHD). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (20 times the MRHD) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats."
    ],
    "geriatric_use": [
      "Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole oral solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole oral solution in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of itraconazole use should be reassessed. (See WARNINGS: Hepatic Effects and PRECAUTIONS: Hepatotoxicity and Information for Patients .)

If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure occur during administration of itraconazole capsules, discontinue administration. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to dogs and healthy human volunteers, negative inotropic effects were seen (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience , and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations for more information). Drug Interactions: Co-administration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole capsules. Some examples of drugs that are contraindicated for co-administration with itraconazole capsules are: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor, finerenone, voclosporin. Co-administration with colchicine, fesoterodine and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment Co-administration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors. Co-administration with venetoclax is contraindicated in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) during the dose initiation and ramp-up phase of venetoclax (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples). Co-administration with itraconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsades de pointes , a potentially fatal arrhythmia (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS Sections, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples)."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following oral administration. As a consequence of non-linear pharmacokinetics, itraconazole accumulates in plasma during multiple dosing. Steady-state concentrations are generally reached within about 15 days, with C max values of 0.5 mcg/mL, 1.1 mcg/mL and 2 mcg/mL after oral administration of 100 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily and 200 mg b.i.d., respectively. The terminal half-life of itraconazole generally ranges from 16 to 28 hours after single dose and increases to 34 to 42 hours with repeated dosing. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. Itraconazole mean total plasma clearance following intravenous administration is 278 mL/min. Itraconazole clearance decreases at higher doses due to saturable hepatic metabolism. Absorption Itraconazole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following an oral capsule dose. The observed absolute oral bioavailability of itraconazole is about 55%. The oral bioavailability of itraconazole is maximal when itraconazole capsules are taken immediately after a full meal. Absorption of itraconazole capsules is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g., H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Absorption of itraconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when itraconazole capsules are administered with an acidic beverage (such as a non-diet cola). When itraconazole capsules were administered as a single 200-mg dose under fasted conditions with non-diet cola after ranitidine pretreatment, a H 2 -receptor antagonist, itraconazole absorption was comparable to that observed when itraconazole capsules were administered alone (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Itraconazole exposure is lower with the capsule formulation than with the oral solution when the same dose of drug is given (see WARNINGS ). Distribution Most of the itraconazole in plasma is bound to protein (99.8%), with albumin being the main binding component (99.6% for the hydroxy-metabolite). It has also a marked affinity for lipids. Only 0.2% of the itraconazole in plasma is present as free drug. Itraconazole is distributed in a large apparent volume in the body (>700 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Concentrations in lung, kidney, liver, bone, stomach, spleen and muscle were found to be two to three times higher than corresponding concentrations in plasma, and the uptake into keratinous tissues, skin in particular, up to four times higher. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are much lower than in plasma. Metabolism Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into a large number of metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of itraconazole. The main metabolite is hydroxy-itraconazole, which has in vitro antifungal activity comparable to itraconazole; trough plasma concentrations of this metabolite are about twice those of itraconazole. Excretion Itraconazole is excreted mainly as inactive metabolites in urine (35%) and in feces (54%) within one week of an oral solution dose. Renal excretion of itraconazole and the active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole account for less than 1% of an intravenous dose. Based on an oral radiolabeled dose, fecal excretion of unchanged drug ranges from 3% to 18% of the dose. As re-distribution of itraconazole from keratinous tissues appears to be negligible, elimination of itraconazole from these tissues is related to epidermal regeneration. Contrary to plasma, the concentration in skin persists for 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of a 4-week treatment and in nail keratin \u2013 where itraconazole can be detected as early as 1 week after start of treatment \u2013 for at least six months after the end of a 3-month treatment period. Special Populations: Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. A pharmacokinetic study using a single 200-mg oral dose of itraconazole was conducted in three groups of patients with renal impairment (uremia: n=7; hemodialysis: n=7; and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: n=5). In uremic subjects with a mean creatinine clearance of 13 mL/min. \u00d7 1.73 m 2 , the exposure, based on AUC, was slightly reduced compared with normal population parameters. This study did not demonstrate any significant effect of hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole (T max , C max , and AUC 0-8h ). Plasma concentration-versus-time profiles showed wide intersubject variation in all three groups. After a single intravenous dose, the mean terminal half-lives of itraconazole in patients with mild (defined in this study as CrCl 50 mL/min to 79 mL/min), moderate (defined in this study as CrCl 20 mL/min to 49 mL/min), and severe renal impairment (defined in this study as CrCl < 20 mL/min) were similar to that in healthy subjects (range of means 42 to 49 hours vs 48 hours in renally impaired patients and healthy subjects, respectively). Overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was decreased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, as compared with subjects with normal renal function. Data are not available in renally impaired patients during long-term use of itraconazole. Dialysis has no effect on the half-life or clearance of itraconazole or hydroxy-itraconazole (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Impairment: Itraconazole is predominantly metabolized in the liver. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 6 healthy and 12 cirrhotic subjects who were administered a single 100-mg dose of itraconazole as capsule. A statistically significant reduction in mean C max (47%) and a twofold increase in the elimination half-life (37 \u00b1 17 hours vs. 16 \u00b1 5 hours) of itraconazole were noted in cirrhotic subjects compared with healthy subjects. However, overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Data are not available in cirrhotic patients during long-term use of itraconazole (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Decreased Cardiac Contractility: When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, itraconazole should be discontinued (see BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience for more information)."

Antimicrobial Activity: Itraconazole exhibits in vitro activity against Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Histoplasma duboisii, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Trichophyton species (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Description of Clinical Studies ). Susceptibility Testing Methods: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC . Resistance: Isolates from several fungal species with decreased susceptibility to itraconazole have been isolated in vitro and from patients receiving prolonged therapy. Itraconazole is not active against Zygomycetes (e.g., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Mucor spp. and Absidia spp.), Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp. Cross-resistance: Several in vitro studies have reported that some fungal clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility to one azole antifungal agent may also be less susceptible to other azole derivatives. The finding of cross-resistance is dependent on a number of factors, including the species evaluated, its clinical history, the particular azole compounds compared, and the type of susceptibility test that is performed. Studies (both in vitro and in vivo ) suggest that the activity of amphotericin B may be suppressed by prior azole antifungal therapy. As with other azoles, itraconazole inhibits the 14 C-demethylation step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a cell wall component of fungi. Ergosterol is the active site for amphotericin B. In one study the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatus infections in mice was inhibited by ketoconazole therapy. The clinical significance of test results obtained in this study is unknown."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Itraconazole capsules are indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients: Blastomycosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non-meningeal histoplasmosis, and Aspergillosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, in patients who are intolerant of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy. Specimens for fungal cultures and other relevant laboratory studies (wet mount, histopathology, serology) should be obtained before therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, antiinfective therapy should be adjusted accordingly. Itraconazole capsules are also indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients: Onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium), and Onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium). Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing (KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations , CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience for more information). Description of Clinical Studies: Blastomycosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=73 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status. The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 6 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of blastomycosis compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=34 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status (not including HIV-infected patients). The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 12 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of histoplasmosis, compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients: Data from a small number of HIV-infected patients suggested that the response rate of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is similar to that of non-HIV-infected patients. The clinical course of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is more severe and usually requires maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Aspergillosis: Analyses were conducted on data from an open-label, \u201csingle-patient-use\u201d protocol designed to make itraconazole available in the U.S. for patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy (N=190). The findings were corroborated by two smaller open-label studies (N=31 combined) in the same patient population. Most adult patients were treated with a daily dose of 200 mg to 400 mg, with a median duration of 3 months. Results of these studies demonstrated substantial evidence of effectiveness of itraconazole as a second-line therapy for the treatment of aspergillosis compared with the natural history of the disease in patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy. Onychomycosis of the toenail: Analyses were conducted on data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (N=214 total; 110 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the toenails received 200 mg of itraconazole capsules once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Results of these studies demonstrated mycologic cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 54% of patients. Thirty-five percent (35%) of patients were considered an overall success (mycologic cure plus clear or minimal nail involvement with significantly decreased signs) and 14% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure (clearance of all signs, with or without residual nail deformity). The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months. Twenty-one percent (21%) of the overall success group had a relapse (worsening of the global score or conversion of KOH or culture from negative to positive). Onychomycosis of the fingernail: Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N=73 total; 37 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course (pulse) of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without itraconazole capsules, which was followed by a second 1-week pulse of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent (56%) of patients were considered an overall success and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Congestive Heart Failure: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF (see BOXED_WARNING , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions -Calcium Channel Blockers, ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience , and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations ). Drug Interactions: Co-administration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole. Some examples of drugs for which plasma concentrations increase are: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor, finerenone, voclosporin. In addition, co-administration with colchicine, fesoterodine and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, and co-administration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples). This increase in drug concentrations caused by co-administration with itraconazole may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes , a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Some specific examples are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions . Co-administration with venetoclax is contraindicated in patients with CLL/SLL during the dose initiation and ramp-up phase of venetoclax due to the potential for an increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole capsules are contraindicated for patients who have shown hypersensitivity to itraconazole. There is limited information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between itraconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing itraconazole capsules to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles."

      "Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, torsade de pointes , respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. Table 1 lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but it is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential, and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

      "WARNINGS Hepatic Effects: Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Continued itraconazole use or reinstitution of treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk (see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Cardiac Dysrhythmias: Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with itraconazole and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with itraconazole is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ) . Cardiac Disease: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. Itraconazole capsules should not be used for other indications in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. For patients with risk factors for congestive heart failure, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of itraconazole therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Such patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF, should be treated with caution, and should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, discontinue administration. Itraconazole has been shown to have a negative inotropic effect. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. Itraconazole has been associated with reports of congestive heart failure. In post-marketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving a total daily dose of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses. Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of itraconazole and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated. Cases of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the post-marketing period among patients being treated for onychomycosis and/or systemic fungal infections (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations , CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience for more information). Pseudoaldosteronism: Pseudoaldosteronism, manifested by the onset of hypertension or worsening of hypertension, and abnormal laboratory findings (hypokalemia, low serum renin and aldosterone, and elevated 11-deoxycortisol), has been reported with itraconazole use in the post-marketing setting. Monitor blood pressure and potassium levels and manage as necessary. Management of pseudoaldosteronism may include discontinuation of itraconazole, substitution with an appropriate antifungal drug that is not associated with pseudoaldosteronism, or use of aldosterone receptor antagonists. Interaction potential: Itraconazole has a potential for clinically important drug interactions. Co-administration of specific drugs with itraconazole may result in changes in efficacy of itraconazole and/or the co-administered drug, life-threatening effects and/or sudden death. Drugs that are contraindicated, not recommended or recommended for use with caution in combination with itraconazole are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions . Interchangeability: Itraconazole capsules and itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably. This is because drug exposure is greater with the oral solution than with the capsules when the same dose of drug is given. In addition, the topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the two formulations. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Itraconazole capsules should be administered after a full meal (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Hepatotoxicity: Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with itraconazole treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving itraconazole. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction. Neuropathy: If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to itraconazole capsules, the treatment should be discontinued. Immunocompromised Patients: In some immunocompromised patients (e.g., neutropenic, AIDS or organ transplant patients), the oral bioavailability of itraconazole capsules may be decreased. Therefore, the dose should be adjusted based on the clinical response in these patients. Cystic Fibrosis: If a cystic fibrosis patient does not respond to itraconazole capsules, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. For more information concerning the use of itraconazole in cystic fibrosis patients see the prescribing information for itraconazole oral solution. Hearing Loss: Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions , CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Information for Patients: The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the itraconazole capsules and oral solution. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole oral solution. Instruct patients to take itraconazole capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines. Drug Interactions: Effect of Itraconazole on Other Drugs Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazole has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs.

Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Meloxicam Concomitant drug dose increase may be necessary. Effect of Other Drugs on Itraconazole Itraconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole. Some concomitant drugs have the potential to interact with itraconazole resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of itraconazole. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with itraconazole. Decreased concentrations may reduce itraconazole efficacy. Table 2 lists examples of drugs that may affect itraconazole concentrations, but is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole. Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 2 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

Pediatric Population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 400 mg/day based on body surface area comparisons). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation (Drosophila melanogaster) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 mg/kg/day to 160 mg/kg/day (1 to 4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Highly effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During post-marketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience ). Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants. Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD of 400 mg based on body surface area comparisons). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions , CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). HIV-Infected Patients: Because hypochlorhydria has been reported in HIV-infected individuals, the absorption of itraconazole in these patients may be decreased. Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. The exposure of itraconazole may be lower in some patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when itraconazole is administered in this patient population and dose adjustment may be needed (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. It is recommended that patients with impaired hepatic function be carefully monitored when taking itraconazole. It is recommended that the prolonged elimination half-life of itraconazole observed in the single oral dose clinical trial with itraconazole capsules in cirrhotic patients be considered when deciding to initiate therapy with other medications metabolized by CYP3A4. In patients with elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be done in patients with pre-existing hepatic function abnormalities or those who have experienced liver toxicity with other medications (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "Information for Patients: The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the itraconazole capsules and oral solution. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole oral solution. Instruct patients to take itraconazole capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 400 mg/day based on body surface area comparisons). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation (Drosophila melanogaster) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons)."
    ],
    "nursing_mothers": [
      "Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants."
    ],
    "pediatric_use": [
      "Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD of 400 mg based on body surface area comparisons). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions , CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of itraconazole use should be reassessed (see WARNINGS: Hepatic Effects and PRECAUTIONS: Hepatotoxicity and Information for Patients ). Adverse Events in the Treatment of Systemic Fungal Infections Adverse event data were derived from 602 patients treated for systemic fungal disease in U.S. clinical trials who were immunocompromised or receiving multiple concomitant medications. Treatment was discontinued in 10.5% of patients due to adverse events. The median duration before discontinuation of therapy was 81 days (range: 2 to 776 days). The table lists adverse events reported by at least 1% of patients.

Adverse Events Reported in Toenail Onychomycosis Clinical Trials Patients in these trials were on a continuous dosing regimen of 200 mg once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. The following adverse events led to temporary or permanent discontinuation of therapy.

Adverse Events Reported from Other Clinical Trials In addition, the following adverse drug reaction was reported in patients who participated in itraconazole capsules clinical trials: Hepatobiliary Disorders: hyperbilirubinemia. The following is a list of additional adverse drug reactions associated with itraconazole that have been reported in clinical trials of itraconazole oral solution and itraconazole IV excluding the adverse reaction term \u201cInjection site inflammation\u201d which is specific to the injection route of administration: Cardiac Disorders: cardiac failure, left ventricular failure, tachycardia; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: face edema, chest pain, chills; Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatic failure, jaundice; Investigations: alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, blood urea increased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, urine analysis abnormal; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia; Psychiatric Disorders: confusional state; Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal impairment; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: dysphonia, cough; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash erythematous, hyperhidrosis; Vascular Disorders: hypotension Post-marketing Experience Adverse drug reactions that have been first identified during post-marketing experience with itraconazole (all formulations) are listed in the table below. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, reliably estimating their frequency or establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is not always possible.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Itraconazole capsules should be taken with a full meal to ensure maximal absorption. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. Itraconazole capsules are a different preparation than itraconazole oral solution and should not be used interchangeably. Treatment of Blastomycosis and Histoplasmosis: The recommended dose is 200 mg once daily (2 capsules). If there is no obvious improvement, or there is evidence of progressive fungal disease, the dose should be increased in 100-mg increments to a maximum of 400 mg daily. Doses above 200 mg/day should be given in two divided doses. Treatment of Aspergillosis: A daily dose of 200 to 400 mg is recommended. Treatment in Life-Threatening Situations: In life-threatening situations, a loading dose should be used. Although clinical studies did not provide for a loading dose, it is recommended, based on pharmacokinetic data, that a loading dose of 200 mg (2 capsules) three times daily (600 mg/day) be given for the first 3 days of treatment. Treatment should be continued for a minimum of three months and until clinical parameters and laboratory tests indicate that the active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Itraconazole capsules and itraconazole oral solution, should not be used interchangeably. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Treatment of Onychomycosis: Toenails with or without fingernail involvement: The recommended dose is 200 mg (2 capsules) once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Treatment of Onychomycosis: Fingernails only: The recommended dosing regimen is 2 treatment pulses, each consisting of 200 mg (2 capsules) b.i.d. (400 mg/day) for 1 week. The pulses are separated by a 3-week period without itraconazole capsules. Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and PRECAUTIONS ). Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS )."

If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure occur during administration of itraconazole capsules, discontinue administration. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to dogs and healthy human volunteers, negative inotropic effects were seen. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations for more information.) Drug Interactions: Coadministration of the following drugs are contraindicated with itraconazole capsules: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, lovastatin, simvastatin, ticagrelor and, in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, colchicine, fesoterodine, telithromycin and solifenacin. See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples. Coadministration with itraconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia.

      "DESCRIPTION Itraconazole Capsule is the generic name for itraconazole, an azole antifungal agent. Itraconazole is a 1:1:1:1 racemic mixture of four diastereomers (two enantiomeric pairs), each possessing three chiral centers. It may be represented by the following structural formula and nomenclature: \u00b1)-1-[( R *)- sec -butyl]-4-[ p -[4-[ p -[[(2 R *,4 S *)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1 H -1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenyl]-\u0394 2 -1,2,4-triazolin-5-one mixture with (\u00b1)-1-[( R *)- sec -butyl]-4-[ p -[4-[ p -[[(2 S *,4 R *)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1 H- 1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenyl]-\u0394 2 -1,2,4-triazolin-5-one or (\u00b1)-1-[( RS )- sec -butyl]-4-[ p -[4-[ p -[[(2 R ,4 S )-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1 H -1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenyl]-\u0394 2 -1,2,4-triazolin-5-one Itraconazole has a molecular formula of C 35 H 38 Cl 2 N 8 O 4 and a molecular weight of 705.64. It is a white or almost white powder. It is freely soluble in methylene chloride, sparingly soluble in tetrahydrofuran, very slightly soluble in alcohol and practically insoluble in water. It has a pKa of 3.7 (based on extrapolation of values obtained from methanolic solutions) and a log (n-octanol/water) partition coefficient of 5.66 at pH 8.1. Itraconazole capsules contain 100 mg of itraconazole coated on sugar spheres (composed of sucrose, starch and purified water). Inactive ingredients are hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, hypromellose, gelatin, titanium dioxide, D&C Red No. 22, FD&C Blue No. 1, and D&C Red No. 28. The imprinting ink contains shellac, propylene glycol, black iron oxide, and potassium hydroxide. Itraconazole Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following oral administration. As a consequence of non-linear pharmacokinetics, itraconazole accumulates in plasma during multiple dosing. Steady-state concentrations are generally reached within about 15 days, with C max values of 0.5 \u03bcg/ml, 1.1 \u03bcg/ml and 2 \u03bcg/ml after oral administration of 100 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily and 200 mg b.i.d., respectively. The terminal half-life of itraconazole generally ranges from 16 to 28 hours after single dose and increases to 34 to 42 hours with repeated dosing. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. Itraconazole mean total plasma clearance following intravenous administration is 278 ml/min. Itraconazole clearance decreases at higher doses due to saturable hepatic metabolism. Absorption Itraconazole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations of itraconazole are reached within 2 to 5 hours following an oral capsule dose. The observed absolute oral bioavailability of itraconazole is about 55%. The oral bioavailability of itraconazole is maximal when itraconazole capsules are taken immediately after a full meal. Absorption of itraconazole capsules is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g., H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) Absorption of itraconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when itraconazole capsules are administered with an acidic beverage (such as a non-diet cola). When itraconazole capsules were administered as a single 200-mg dose under fasted conditions with non-diet cola after ranitidine pretreatment, a H 2 -receptor antagonist, itraconazole absorption was comparable to that observed when itraconazole capsules were administered alone. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) Itraconazole exposure is lower with the Capsule formulation than with the Oral Solution when the same dose of drug is given. (See WARNINGS) Distribution Most of the itraconazole in plasma is bound to protein (99.8%), with albumin being the main binding component (99.6% for the hydroxy-metabolite). It has also a marked affinity for lipids. Only 0.2% of the itraconazole in plasma is present as free drug. Itraconazole is distributed in a large apparent volume in the body (>700 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Concentrations in lung, kidney, liver, bone, stomach, spleen and muscle were found to be two to three times higher than corresponding concentrations in plasma, and the uptake into keratinous tissues, skin in particular, up to four times higher. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are much lower than in plasma. Metabolism Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into a large number of metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of itraconazole. The main metabolite is hydroxy-itraconazole, which has in vitro antifungal activity comparable to itraconazole; trough plasma concentrations of this metabolite are about twice those of itraconazole. Excretion Itraconazole is excreted mainly as inactive metabolites in urine (35%) and in feces (54%) within one week of an oral solution dose. Renal excretion of itraconazole and the active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole account for less than 1% of an intravenous dose. Based on an oral radiolabeled dose, fecal excretion of unchanged drug ranges from 3% to 18% of the dose. As re-distribution of itraconazole from keratinous tissues appears to be negligible, elimination of itraconazole from these tissues is related to epidermal regeneration. Contrary to plasma, the concentration in skin persists for 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of a 4-week treatment and in nail keratin \u2013 where itraconazole can be detected as early as 1 week after start of treatment \u2013 for at least six months after the end of a 3-month treatment period. Special Populations: Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. A pharmacokinetic study using a single 200-mg oral dose of itraconazole was conducted in three groups of patients with renal impairment (uremia: n=7; hemodialysis: n=7; and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: n=5). In uremic subjects with a mean creatinine clearance of 13 mL/min. \u00d7 1.73 m 2 , the exposure, based on AUC, was slightly reduced compared with normal population parameters. This study did not demonstrate any significant effect of hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole (T max , C max , and AUC 0-8h ). Plasma concentration-versus-time profiles showed wide intersubject variation in all three groups. After a single intravenous dose, the mean terminal half-lives of itraconazole in patients with mild (defined in this study as CrCl 50 to 79 ml/min), moderate (defined in this study as CrCl 20 to 49 ml/min), and severe renal impairment (defined in this study as CrCl <20 ml/min) were similar to that in healthy subjects (range of means 42 to 49 hours vs 48 hours in renally impaired patients and healthy subjects, respectively). Overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was decreased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, as compared with subjects with normal renal function. Data are not available in renally impaired patients during long-term use of itraconazole. Dialysis has no effect on the half-life or clearance of itraconazole or hydroxyl-itraconazole. (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Hepatic Impairment: Itraconazole is predominantly metabolized in the liver. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 6 healthy and 12 cirrhotic subjects who were administered a single 100-mg dose of itraconazole as capsule. A statistically significant reduction in mean C max (47%) and a twofold increase in the elimination half-life (37 \u00b1 17 hours vs. 16 \u00b1 5 hours) of itraconazole were noted in cirrhotic subjects compared with healthy subjects. However, overall exposure to itraconazole, based on AUC, was similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Data are not available in cirrhotic patients during long-term use of itraconazole. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Decreased Cardiac Contractility: When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, itraconazole should be discontinued. (See BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience for more information.) MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action: In vitro studies have demonstrated that itraconazole inhibits the cytochrome P450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. Activity In Vitro and in Clinical Infections: Itraconazole exhibits in vitro activity against Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Histoplasma duboisii, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Trichophyton species (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE, Description of Clinical Studies). Correlation between minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results in vitro and clinical outcome has yet to be established for azole antifungal agents. Drug Resistance: Isolates from several fungal species with decreased susceptibility to itraconazole have been isolated in vitro and from patients receiving prolonged therapy. Itraconazole is not active against Zygomycetes (e.g., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Mucor spp. and Absidia spp.), Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp. Cross-resistance: Several in vitro studies have reported that some fungal clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility to one azole antifungal agent may also be less susceptible to other azole derivatives. The finding of cross-resistance is dependent on a number of factors, including the species evaluated, its clinical history, the particular azole compounds compared, and the type of susceptibility test that is performed. Studies (both in vitro and in vivo ) suggest that the activity of amphotericin B may be suppressed by prior azole antifungal therapy. As with other azoles, itraconazole inhibits the 14 C-demethylation step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a cell wall component of fungi. Ergosterol is the active site for amphotericin B. In one study the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatus infections in mice was inhibited by ketoconazole therapy. The clinical significance of test results obtained in this study is unknown."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Itraconazole capsules are indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients: 1. Blastomycosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary 2. Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non- meningeal histoplasmosis, and 3. Aspergillosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, in patients who are intolerant of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy. Specimens for fungal cultures and other relevant laboratory studies (wet mount, histopathology, serology) should be obtained before therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, antiinfective therapy should be adjusted accordingly. Itraconazole capsules are also indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients: 1. Onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium), and 2. Onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium). Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing (KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience for more information.) Description of Clinical Studies: Blastomycosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=73 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status. The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 6 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of blastomycosis compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N=34 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status (not including HIV-infected patients). The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 12 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of histoplasmosis, compared with the natural history of untreated cases. Histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients: Data from a small number of HIV-infected patients suggested that the response rate of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is similar to that of non-HIV-infected patients. The clinical course of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients is more severe and usually requires maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Aspergillosis: Analyses were conducted on data from an open-label, \u201csingle-patient-use\u201d protocol designed to make itraconazole available in the U.S. for patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy (N=190). The findings were corroborated by two smaller open-label studies (N=31 combined) in the same patient population. Most adult patients were treated with a daily dose of 200 to 400 mg, with a median duration of 3 months. Results of these studies demonstrated substantial evidence of effectiveness of itraconazole as a second-line therapy for the treatment of aspergillosis compared with the natural history of the disease in patients who either failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B therapy. Onychomycosis of the toenail: Analyses were conducted on data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (N=214 total; 110 given itraconazole capsules in which patients with onychomycosis of the toenails received 200 mg of itraconazole capsules once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Results of these studies demonstrated mycologic cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 54% of patients. Thirty-five percent (35%) of patients were considered an overall success (mycologic cure plus clear or minimal nail involvement with significantly decreased signs) and 14% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure (clearance of all signs, with or without residual nail deformity). The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months. Twenty-one percent (21%) of the overall success group had a relapse (worsening of the global score or conversion of KOH or culture from negative to positive). Onychomycosis of the fingernail: Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N=73 total; 37 given itraconazole capsules in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without itraconazole, which was followed by a second 1-week course of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent (56%) of patients were considered an overall success and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Congestive Heart Failure: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. (See BOXED WARNINGS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions-Calcium Channel Blockers, ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations.) Drug Interactions: Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with itraconazole. Plasma concentrations increase for the following drugs: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, lovastatin, simvastatin, ticagrelor, and, in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, colchicine, fesoterodine, telithromycin and solifenacin. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section for specific examples.) This increase in drug concentrations caused by coadministration with itraconazole may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effect and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Specific examples are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole are contraindicated for patients who have shown hypersensitivity to itraconazole. There is limited information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between itraconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing itraconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hepatic Effects: Itraconazole have been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Continued itraconazole use or reinstitution of treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS.) Cardiac Dysrhythmias: Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with itraconazole and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with itraconazole is contraindicated. (See BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) Cardiac Disease: Itraconazole capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. Itraconazole capsules should not be used for other indications in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. For patients with risk factors for congestive heart failure, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of itraconazole therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Such patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF, should be treated with caution, and should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear during administration of itraconazole capsules, discontinue administration. Itraconazole has been shown to have a negative inotropic effect. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. Itraconazole has been associated with reports of congestive heart failure. In post-marketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving a total daily dose of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses. Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of itraconazole and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated. Cases of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the post-marketing period among patients being treated for onychomycosis and/or systemic fungal infections. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience for more information.) Interaction potential: Itraconazole has a potential for clinically important drug interactions. Coadministration of specific drugs with itraconazole may result in changes in efficacy of itraconazole and/or the coadministered drug, life-threatening effects and/or sudden death. Drugs that are contraindicated, not recommended or recommended for use with caution in combination with itraconazole are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. Interchangeability: Itraconazole capsules and itraconazole Oral Solution should not be used interchangeably. This is because drug exposure is greater with the Oral Solution than with the capsules when the same dose of drug is given. In addition, the topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the two formulations. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Itraconazole capsules should be administered after a full meal. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). Hepatotoxicity: Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with itraconazole treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving itraconazole. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction. Neuropathy: If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to itraconazole capsules, the treatment should be discontinued . Cystic Fibrosis: If a cystic fibrosis patient does not respond to itraconazole capsules, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. For more information concerning the use of itraconazole in cystic fibrosis patients see the prescribing information for itraconazole Oral Solution. Hearing Loss: Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Information for Patients: The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the itraconazole capsules and Oral Solution. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole Oral Solution. Instruct patients to take Itraconazole capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines. Drug Interactions: Itraconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other drugs that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole. Similarly, itraconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other drugs that share this metabolic pathway. Itraconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, it is recommended that the corresponding label be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Drugs that may decrease itraconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H 2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of itraconazole from itraconazole capsules. It is recommended that these drugs be used with caution when coadministered with itraconazole capsules: \u00b7 It is recommended that itraconazole capsules be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. \u00b7 It is recommended that acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of itraconazole capsules. \u00b7 Upon coadministration, it is recommended that the antifungal activity be monitored and the itraconazole dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of itraconazole with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of itraconazole and hydroxy-itraconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: \u00b7 Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under \u2018Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole\u2019), rifampicin \u00b7 Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, (see also under \u2018Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole\u2019), phenobarbital, phenytoin \u00b7 Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with itraconazole is not recommended. It is recommended that the use of these drugs be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with itraconazole, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced itraconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, it is recommended that the antifungal activity be monitored and the itraconazole dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase itraconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the bioavailability of itraconazole. Examples include: \u00b7 Antibacterials: ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin \u00b7 Antivirals: ritonavir-boosted darunavir, ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir, indinavir (see also under \u2018Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole\u2019), ritonavir (see also under \u2018Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole\u2019) and telaprevir. It is recommended that these drugs be used with caution when coadministered with itraconazole capsules. It is recommended that patients who must take itraconazole concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of itraconazole, and the itraconazole dose be decreased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with itraconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with itraconazole, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. In patients with hepatic cirrhosis or in subjects receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors, the decline in plasma concentrations may be even more gradual. This is particularly important when initiating therapy with drugs whose metabolism is affected by itraconazole. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with itraconazole: Table 1: Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances is the drug to be coadministered with itraconazole, and up to two weeks after discontinuation of treatment with itraconazole. It is recommended that the use of the drug be avoided during and up to two weeks after discontinuation of treatment with itraconazole, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, it is recommended that plasma concentrations be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with itraconazole. Upon coadministration, it is recommended that patients be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, it is recommended that plasma concentrations be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes . Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with itraconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with itraconazole. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation. Antibacterials telithromycin, in subjects with severe renal impairment or severe hepatic impairment rifabutin telithromycin Telithromycin: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of telithromycin in subjects with severe renal impairment or severe hepatic impairment, when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Rifabutin: See also under \u2018Drugs that may decrease itraconazole plasma concentrations\u2019. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs ticagrelor apixaban, rivaroxaban coumarins, cilostazol, dabigatran Ticagrelor: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ticagrelor may increase the risk of bleeding. Coumarins: Itraconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, such as warfarin. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. Although there are no data regarding the effect of itraconazole on carbamazepine metabolism, because of the similarities between ketoconazole and itraconazole, concomitant administration of itraconazole and carbamazepine may inhibit the metabolism of carbamazepine. See also under \u2018Drugs that may decrease itraconazole plasma concentrations\u2019. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot Alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Antineoplastics irinotecan axitinib, dabrafenib, dasatinib, ibrutinib, nilotinib, sunitinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, lapatinib, ponatinib, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam alprazolam, aripiprazole, buspirone, diazepam, haloperidol, midazolam IV, perospirone, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone Midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of itraconazole and oral midazolam, or triazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes . Antivirals simeprevir maraviroc, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Indinavir, ritonavir: See also under \u2018Drugs that may increase itraconazole plasma concentrations\u2019. Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of itraconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of itraconazole may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Edema has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving itraconazole and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, sildenafil, for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension bosentan, riociguat Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation. Diuretics eplerenone Eplerenone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of cisapride when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation. Immunosuppres sants everolimus, temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), tacrolimus Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, in subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment, or moderate to severe hepatic impairment, solifenacin, in subjects with severe renal impairment or moderate to severe hepatic impairment darifenacin, vardenafil fesoterodine. oxybutynin, sildenafil, for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine Fesoterodine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of the fesoterodine active metabolite may be greater in subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment, or moderate to severe hepatic impairment, which may lead to an increased risk of adverse reactions. Solifenacin: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of solifenacin in subjects with severe renal impairment or moderate to severe hepatic impairment, when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment colchicine, conivaptan, tolvaptan cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Conivaptan and Tolvaptan: A safe and effective dose of either conivaptan or tolvaptan has not been established when coadministered with itraconazole. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations decreased by itraconazole Coadministration of itraconazole with the NSAID meloxicam may decrease the plasma concentration of meloxicam. It is recommended that meloxicam be used with caution when coadministered with itraconazole, and its effects or side effects be monitored. It is recommended that the dosage of meloxicam, if coadministered with itraconazole, be adjusted if necessary. Pediatric Population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 10x the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (3.1x MRHD) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (6.25x MRHD) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation ( Drosophila melanogaster ) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (5x MRHD), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (20x MRHD). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 to 160 mg/kg/day (5 to 20x MRHD), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (10x MRHD). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During post-marketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience.) Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants. Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (2.5x MRHD). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (10x MRHD) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (20x MRHD) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). HIV-Infected Patients: Because hypochlorhydria has been reported in HIV-infected individuals, the absorption of itraconazole in these patients may be decreased. Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. The exposure of itraconazole may be lower in some patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when itraconazole is administered in this patient population and dose adjustment may be needed. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. It is recommended that patients with impaired hepatic function be carefully monitored when taking itraconazole. It is recommended that the prolonged elimination half-life of itraconazole observed in the single oral dose clinical trial with itraconazole capsules in cirrhotic patients be considered when deciding to initiate therapy with other medications metabolized by CYP3A4. In patients with elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment with itraconazole is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be done in patients with preexisting hepatic function abnormalities or those who have experienced liver toxicity with other medications. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)"

      "General: Itraconazole capsules should be administered after a full meal. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). Hepatotoxicity: Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with itraconazole treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving itraconazole. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction. Neuropathy: If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to itraconazole capsules, the treatment should be discontinued . Cystic Fibrosis: If a cystic fibrosis patient does not respond to itraconazole capsules, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. For more information concerning the use of itraconazole in cystic fibrosis patients see the prescribing information for itraconazole Oral Solution. Hearing Loss: Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients: The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the itraconazole capsules and Oral Solution. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Itraconazole capsules should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole Oral Solution. Instruct patients to take Itraconazole capsules with a full meal. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during itraconazole administration, they should discontinue itraconazole and contact their healthcare provider immediately. Instruct patients to stop itraconazole treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions: Itraconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other drugs that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole. Similarly, itraconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other drugs that share this metabolic pathway. Itraconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, it is recommended that the corresponding label be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Drugs that may decrease itraconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H 2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of itraconazole from itraconazole capsules. It is recommended that these drugs be used with caution when coadministered with itraconazole capsules: \u00b7 It is recommended that itraconazole capsules be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. \u00b7 It is recommended that acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of itraconazole capsules. \u00b7 Upon coadministration, it is recommended that the antifungal activity be monitored and the itraconazole dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of itraconazole with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of itraconazole and hydroxy-itraconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: \u00b7 Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under \u2018Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole\u2019), rifampicin \u00b7 Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, (see also under \u2018Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole\u2019), phenobarbital, phenytoin \u00b7 Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with itraconazole is not recommended. It is recommended that the use of these drugs be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with itraconazole, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced itraconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, it is recommended that the antifungal activity be monitored and the itraconazole dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase itraconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the bioavailability of itraconazole. Examples include: \u00b7 Antibacterials: ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin \u00b7 Antivirals: ritonavir-boosted darunavir, ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir, indinavir (see also under \u2018Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole\u2019), ritonavir (see also under \u2018Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole\u2019) and telaprevir. It is recommended that these drugs be used with caution when coadministered with itraconazole capsules. It is recommended that patients who must take itraconazole concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of itraconazole, and the itraconazole dose be decreased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with itraconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with itraconazole, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. In patients with hepatic cirrhosis or in subjects receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors, the decline in plasma concentrations may be even more gradual. This is particularly important when initiating therapy with drugs whose metabolism is affected by itraconazole. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with itraconazole: Table 1: Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances is the drug to be coadministered with itraconazole, and up to two weeks after discontinuation of treatment with itraconazole. It is recommended that the use of the drug be avoided during and up to two weeks after discontinuation of treatment with itraconazole, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, it is recommended that plasma concentrations be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with itraconazole. Upon coadministration, it is recommended that patients be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, it is recommended that plasma concentrations be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes . Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with itraconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with itraconazole. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation. Antibacterials telithromycin, in subjects with severe renal impairment or severe hepatic impairment rifabutin telithromycin Telithromycin: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of telithromycin in subjects with severe renal impairment or severe hepatic impairment, when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Rifabutin: See also under \u2018Drugs that may decrease itraconazole plasma concentrations\u2019. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs ticagrelor apixaban, rivaroxaban coumarins, cilostazol, dabigatran Ticagrelor: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ticagrelor may increase the risk of bleeding. Coumarins: Itraconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, such as warfarin. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. Although there are no data regarding the effect of itraconazole on carbamazepine metabolism, because of the similarities between ketoconazole and itraconazole, concomitant administration of itraconazole and carbamazepine may inhibit the metabolism of carbamazepine. See also under \u2018Drugs that may decrease itraconazole plasma concentrations\u2019. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot Alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Antineoplastics irinotecan axitinib, dabrafenib, dasatinib, ibrutinib, nilotinib, sunitinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, lapatinib, ponatinib, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam alprazolam, aripiprazole, buspirone, diazepam, haloperidol, midazolam IV, perospirone, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone Midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of itraconazole and oral midazolam, or triazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with itraconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes . Antivirals simeprevir maraviroc, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Indinavir, ritonavir: See also under \u2018Drugs that may increase itraconazole plasma concentrations\u2019. Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of itraconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with itraconazole may increase the risk of congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of itraconazole may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Edema has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving itraconazole and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 10x the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (3.1x MRHD) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (6.25x MRHD) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant. Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium (6 strains) and Escherichia coli , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation ( Drosophila melanogaster ) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T\u00bd C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40 mg/kg/day (5x MRHD), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (20x MRHD)."

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C: Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40 to 160 mg/kg/day (5 to 20x MRHD), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (10x MRHD). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia. There are no studies in pregnant women. Itraconazole should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. Itraconazole should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Effective contraception should be continued throughout itraconazole therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment. During post-marketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience.)"

      "Nursing Mothers: Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of itraconazole therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant.

    "pediatric_use": [
      "Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of itraconazole have not been established in pediatric patients. The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (2.5x MRHD). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (10x MRHD) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (20x MRHD) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of itraconazole capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use itraconazole capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions, CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions)."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of itraconazole use should be reassessed. (See WARNINGS: Hepatic Effects and PRECAUTIONS: Hepatotoxicity and Information for Patients.) Adverse Events in the Treatment of Systemic Fungal Infections Adverse event data were derived from 602 patients treated for systemic fungal disease in U.S. clinical trials who were immunocompromised or receiving multiple concomitant medications. Treatment was discontinued in 10.5% of patients due to adverse events. The median duration before discontinuation of therapy was 81 days (range: 2 to 776 days). The table lists adverse events reported by at least 1% of patients.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Itraconazole capsules should be taken with a full meal to ensure maximal absorption. Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. Itraconazole capsule is a different preparation than itraconazole Oral Solution and should not be used interchangeably. Treatment of Blastomycosis and Histoplasmosis: The recommended dose is 200 mg once daily (2 capsules). If there is no obvious improvement, or there is evidence of progressive fungal disease, the dose should be increased in 100-mg increments to a maximum of 400 mg daily. Doses above 200 mg/day should be given in two divided doses. Treatment of Aspergillosis: A daily dose of 200 to 400 mg is recommended. Treatment in Life-Threatening Situations: In life-threatening situations, a loading dose should be used. Although clinical studies did not provide for a loading dose, it is recommended, based on pharmacokinetic data, that a loading dose of 200 mg (2 capsules) three times daily (600 mg/day) be given for the first 3 days of treatment. Treatment should be continued for a minimum of three months and until clinical parameters and laboratory tests indicate that the active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Itraconazole capsules and itraconazole Oral Solution should not be used interchangeably. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Treatment of Onychomycosis: Toenails with or without fingernail involvement: The recommended dose is 200 mg (2 capsules) once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Treatment of Onychomycosis: Fingernails only: The recommended dosing regimen is two treatment courses, each consisting of 200 mg (2 capsules) b.i.d. (400 mg/day) for 1 week. The courses are separated by a 3-week period without itraconazole. Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and PRECAUTIONS .) Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment.

      "PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET Itraconazole (IT-ra-KON-a-zole) Capsules Rx Only This summary contains important information about itraconazole. This information is for patients who have been prescribed itraconazole to treat fungal nail infections . If your doctor prescribed itraconazole for medical problems other than fungal nail infections, ask your doctor if there is any information in this summary that does not apply to you. Read this information carefully each time you start to use itraconazole. This information does not take the place of discussion between you and your doctor. Only your doctor can decide if itraconazole is the right treatment for you. If you do not understand some of this information or have any questions, talk with your doctor or pharmacist. WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ITRACONAZOLE? Itraconazole is used to treat fungal nail infections. However, itraconazole is not for everyone. Do not take itraconazole for fungal nail infections if you have had heart failure, including congestive heart failure. You should not take itraconazole if you are taking certain medicines that could lead to serious or life-threatening medical problems. (See \u201cWho Should Not Take Itraconazole?\u201d below.) If you have had heart, lung, liver, kidney or other serious health problems, ask your doctor if it is safe for you to take itraconazole. WHAT HAPPENS IF I HAVE A FUNGAL NAIL INFECTION? Anyone can have a fungal nail infection, but it is usually found in adults. When a fungus infects the tip or sides of a nail, the infected part of the nail may turn yellow or brown. If not treated, the fungus may spread under the nail towards the cuticle. If the fungus spreads, more of the nail may change color, may become thick or brittle, and the tip of the nail may become raised. In some patients, this can cause pain and discomfort. WHAT IS ITRACONAZOLE? Itraconazole is a prescription medicine used to treat fungal infections of the toenails and fingernails. It is also used to treat some types of fungal infections in other areas of your body. We do not know if itraconazole works in children with fungal nail infections or if it is safe for children to take. Itraconazole comes in the form of capsules and liquid (oral solution). The capsule and liquid forms work differently, so you should not use one in place of the other. This Patient Information discusses only the capsule form of itraconazole. You will get these capsules in a medicine bottle. Itraconazole goes into your bloodstream and travels to the source of the infection underneath the nail so that it can fight the infection there. Improved nails may not be obvious for several months after the treatment period is finished because it usually takes about 6 months to grow a new fingernail and 12 months to grow a new toenail. WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE ITRACONAZOLE? Itraconazole are not for everyone. Your doctor will decide if itraconazole is the right treatment for you. Some patients should not take itraconazole because they may have certain health problems or may be taking certain medicines that could lead to serious or life-threatening medical problems. Tell your doctor and pharmacist the name of all the prescription and non-prescription medicines you are taking, including dietary supplements and herbal remedies.
