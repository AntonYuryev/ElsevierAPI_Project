      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed. If either occurs, discontinue treatment until parameters of calcium metabolism normalize. (5.1) \u2022 Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency during and after withdrawal of treatment. Risk factors include the use of high-potency topical corticosteroid, use over a large surface area or to areas under occlusion, prolonged use, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and use in pediatric patients. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. (5.2, 8.4) \u2022 Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment may increase the risk of cataract and glaucoma. If visual symptoms occur, consider referral to an ophthalmologist. (5.3) 5.1 Hypercalcemia and Hypercalciuria Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed with use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. If hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria develops, treatment should be discontinued until parameters of calcium metabolism have normalized. In the trials that included assessment of the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on calcium metabolism, such testing was done after 4 weeks of treatment. The effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on calcium metabolism following treatment durations of longer than 4 weeks have not been evaluated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . 5.2 Effects on Endocrine System Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency corticosteroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the cosyntropin stimulation test [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a trial evaluating the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension and calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the HPA axis, 32 adult subjects were treated with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp and calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression was identified in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . The effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the HPA axis following treatment durations of longer than 4 weeks have not been adequately studied. If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid. Cushing's syndrome and hyperglycemia may also occur due to the systemic effects of topical corticosteroids. These complications are rare and generally occur after prolonged exposure to excessively large doses, especially of high-potency topical corticosteroids. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their higher skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. 5.3 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids, including Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment, may increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Glaucoma and cataracts have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products, including topical clobetasol products. Avoid contact of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.5 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Calcipotriene Allergic contact dermatitis has been observed with use of topical calcipotriene. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.6 Skin Irritation If irritation develops, treatment with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.7 Risk of Ultraviolet Light Exposure Patients who apply Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment to exposed skin should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight, including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc. Physicians may wish to limit or avoid use of phototherapy in patients who use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (\u22651%) are pruritus and scaly rash. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Perrigo at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Clinical Trials Conducted in Subjects 18 years and older with Plaque Psoriasis The data described below reflect exposure to calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment in 2448 subjects with plaque psoriasis, including 1992 exposed for 4 weeks, and 289 exposed for 8 weeks. Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was studied primarily in placebo- and active-controlled trials (N = 1176, and N = 1272, respectively). The population was 15-97 years old, 61% males and 39% females, mostly white (97%) and had a baseline disease severity ranging from mild to very severe. Most subjects received once daily application, and the median weekly dose was 24.5 g. The percentage of subjects reporting at least one adverse event was 27.1% in the calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment group, 33.0% in the calcipotriene group, 28.3% in the betamethasone group, and 33.4% in the vehicle group. Table 1 Adverse Events Reported by \u22651% of Subjects by Preferred Term Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment N = 2448 Calcipotriene N = 3197 Betamethasone dipropionate N = 1164 Vehicle N = 470 Any Adverse Event 663 (27.1) 1055 (33.0) 329 (28.3) 157 (33.4) Preferred Term # of subjects (%) Pruritus 75 (3.1) 183 (5.7) 38 (3.3) 43 (9.1) Headache 69 (2.8) 75 (2.3) 44 (3.8) 12 (2.6) Nasopharyngitis 56 (2.3) 77 (2.4) 34 (2.9) 9 (1.9) Psoriasis 30 (1.2) 47 (1.5) 14 (1.2) 5 (1.1) Rash scaly 30 (1.2) 40 (1.3) 0 (0.0) 1 (0.2) Influenza 23 (0.9) 34 (1.1) 14 (1.2) 6 (1.3) Upper respiratory tract infection 20 (0.8) 19 (0.6) 12 (1.0) 3 (0.6) Erythema 15 (0.6) 54 (1.7) 3 (0.3) 5 (1.1) Application site pruritus 13 (0.5) 24 (0.8) 10 (0.9) 6 (1.3) Skin irritation 11 (0.4) 60 (1.9) 8 (0.7) 5 (1.1) Pain 7 (0.3) 12 (0.4) 3 (0.3) 5 (1.1) Burning sensation 6 (0.2) 30 (0.9) 3 (0.3) 6 (1.3) A lesional/perilesional adverse event was generally defined as an adverse event located \u2264 2 cm from the lesional border. Table 2 Lesional/Perilesional Adverse Events Reported by \u2265 1% of Subjects Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment N = 2448 Calcipotriene N = 3197 Betamethasone dipropionate N = 1164 Vehicle N = 470 Any Adverse Event 213 (8.7) 419 (13.1) 85 (7.3) 76 (16.2) Preferred Term # of subjects (%) Pruritus 69 (2.8) 170 (5.3) 31 (2.7) 41 (8.7) Rash scaly 29 (1.2) 38 (1.2) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Application site pruritus 12 (0.5) 24 (0.8) 10 (0.9) 6 (1.3) Erythema 9 (0.4) 36 (1.1) 2 (0.2) 4 (0.9) Skin irritation 9 (0.4) 51 (1.6) 8 (0.7) 5 (1.1) Burning sensation 6 (0.2) 25 (0.8) 3 (0.3) 5 (1.1) For subjects who reported lesional/perilesional adverse events, the median time to onset was 7 days for calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment, 7 days for calcipotriene, 5 days for betamethasone dipropionate, and 3 days for vehicle. Other less common reactions (less than 1% but more than 0.1%) were, in decreasing order of incidence, folliculitis, rash papular, rash pustular, and skin hypopigmentation. Skin atrophy, telangiectasia and skin hyperpigmentation were reported infrequently (0.1%). In a separate trial, subjects (N = 207) with at least moderate disease severity were given calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment intermittently on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis for up to 52 weeks. The median use was 15.4 g per week. The effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on calcium metabolism were not studied and the effects on the HPA axis were not adequately studied. The following adverse reactions were reported by 1% or more of the subjects: pruritus (7.2%), psoriasis (3.4%), skin atrophy (1.9%), folliculitis (1.4%), burning sensation (1.4%), skin depigmentation (1.4%), ecchymosis (1.0%), erythema (1.0%) and hand dermatitis (1.0%). One case of serious flare-up of psoriasis was reported. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions associated with the use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment have been identified post-approval: pustular psoriasis and rebound effect. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Postmarketing reports for local adverse reactions to topical corticosteroids may also include: striae, dryness, acneiform eruptions, perioral dermatitis, secondary infection and miliaria."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment contains calcipotriene and bethamethasone dipropionate. The limited data with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment and calcipotriene use in pregnant women are not sufficient to evaluate a Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment-associated or calcipotriene-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Observational studies suggest an increased risk of having low birthweight infants with the maternal use of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women that Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment may increase the potential risk of having a low birth weight infant and to use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs ( see Data ). Oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis had no apparent effects on embryo-fetal development. Subcutaneous administration of betamethasone dipropionate to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, and fetal malformations (cleft palate and crooked or short tail) ( see Data ). The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposures of calcipotriene and betamethasone diproprionate observed in animal studies to the systemic exposures that would be expected in humans after topical use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Available observational studies in pregnant women did not identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, preterm delivery, or fetal mortality with the use of topical corticosteroids of any potency. However, when the dispensed amount of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids exceeded 300 g during the entire pregnancy, maternal use was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight in infants. Animal Data Embryo-fetal development studies with calcipotriene were performed by the oral route in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats received dosages of 0, 6, 18, or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-15 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). There were no apparent effects on maternal survival, behavior, or body weight gain, no effects on litter parameters, and no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses. Fetuses from dams dosed at 54 mcg/kg/day exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. Pregnant rabbits were dosed daily with calcipotriene at exposures of 0, 4, 12, or 36 mcg/kg/day (0, 48, 144, and 432 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Mean maternal body weight gain was reduced in animals dosed at 12 or 36 mcg/kg/day. The incidence of fetal deaths was increased in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day; reduced fetal weight was also observed in this group. The incidence of major malformations among fetuses was not affected. An increase in the incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including incomplete ossification of sternebrae, pubic bones, and forelimb phalanges, was observed in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day. Embryo-fetal development studies with betamethasone dipropionate were performed via subcutaneous injection in mice and rabbits. Pregnant mice were administered doses of 0, 156, 625, or 2500 mcg/kg/day (0, 468, 1875, and 7500 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 7 through 13 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, malformations (increased incidence of the cleft palate and crooked or short tail), and minor skeletal abnormalities (delayed ossification of vertebra and sternebrae). Fetal toxicity was observed at the lowest exposure that was evaluated (156 mcg/kg/day). Pregnant rabbits were injected subcutaneously at dosages of 0, 0.625, 2.5, and 10 mcg/kg/day (0, 7.5, 30, and 120 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6 through 18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, external malformations (including malformed ears, cleft palate, umbilical hernia, kinked tail, club foot, and club hand), and skeletal malformations (including absence of phalanges of the first digit and cranial dysplasia) at dosages of 2.5 mcg/kg/day and above. Calcipotriene was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 6, 18 or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 15 through day 20 postpartum. No remarkable effects were observed on any parameter, including survival, behavior, body weight, litter parameters, or the ability to nurse or rear pups. Betamethasone dipropionate was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day (0, 600, 1800, and 6000 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 6 through day 20 postpartum. Mean maternal body weight was significantly reduced on gestation day 20 in animals dosed at 300 and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean duration of gestation was slightly, but statistically significantly, increased at 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean percentage of pups that survived to day 4 was reduced in relation to dosage. On lactation day 5, the percentage of pups with a reflex to right themselves when placed on their back was significantly reduced at 1000 mcg/ kg/day. No effects on the ability of pups to learn were observed, and the ability of the offspring of treated rats to reproduce was not affected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topically administered calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. It is not known whether topically administered calcipotriene or corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of the use of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment in pediatric patients under the age of 12 years have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment for the treatment of plaque psoriasis have been established in the age group 12 to 17 years. In a prospective, uncontrolled trial, 33 pediatric subjects ages 12-17 years with plaque psoriasis on the body were treated with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment for 4 weeks up to a maximum of 55.8 g per week. Subjects were assessed for HPA axis suppression and effects on calcium metabolism. No adverse effects on adrenal suppression were observed. No hypercalcemia was observed but one subject had a possible treatment-related increase in urinary calcium [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical drugs. They are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency upon the use of topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Rare systemic toxicities such as Cushing\u2019s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids. Local adverse reactions including striae have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in the clinical studies of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment, approximately 14% were 65 years and older and approximately 3% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. All other reported clinical experience has not identified any differences in response between elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment combines the pharmacological effects of calcipotriene as a synthetic vitamin D 3 analogue and betamethasone dipropionate as a synthetic corticosteroid. However, while their pharmacologic and clinical effects are known, the exact mechanisms of their actions in plaque psoriasis are unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Vasoconstriction: In a vasoconstrictor trial in healthy subjects, the skin blanching response of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was consistent with that of a potent corticosteroid when compared with other topical corticosteroids. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression: HPA axis suppression was evaluated in four trials (Trial A, B, C and D) following the application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. In Trial A, calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was applied once daily for 4 weeks to adult subjects (N = 12) with plaque psoriasis to study its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Of eleven subjects tested, none demonstrated adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level \u2264 18 mcg/dL. In Trial B, calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was evaluated in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis (N = 19). One subject demonstrated adrenal suppression. In Trial C, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=32) with extensive plaque psoriasis involving at least 30% of the scalp and, in total, 15-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minutes post-stimulation cortisol level < 18 mcg/dL was observed in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment as per the recommended duration of use [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . In Trial D, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in subjects 12 to 17 years (N=32) with plaque psoriasis of the body involving 5-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment to the affected areas for up to 4 weeks. Mean weekly dose was 29.6 g with a range of 8.1-55.8 g/week. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level \u226418 mcg/dL was observed in none of 32 evaluable subjects after 4 weeks of treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Effects on Calcium Metabolism In Trial C described above, the effects of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp on calcium metabolism were also examined. Elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in 1 of 35 subjects (2.9%) after 4 weeks of treatment. In Trial D described above, calcium metabolism was evaluated in a total of 33 subjects aged 12 to 17 years with plaque psoriasis involving 5-30% of the body surface area who underwent once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment for up to 4 weeks. No cases of hypercalcemia and no clinically relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported. However, one subject had a normal urinary calcium: creatinine ratio at baseline (3.75 mmol/g), which increased above the normal range at week 4 (16 mmol/g). There were no relevant changes in albumin-corrected serum calcium or other markers of calcium metabolism for this subject. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In Trial C described above, the systemic effect of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment in extensive plaque psoriasis was investigated. In this trial, the serum levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 weeks (maximum recommended duration of treatment) and also after 8 weeks of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp. Both calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate were below the lower limit of quantification in all serum samples of the 34 subjects evaluated. However, one major metabolite of calcipotriene (MC1080) was quantifiable in 10 of 34 (29.4%) subjects at week 4 and in five of 12 (41.7%) subjects at week 8. The major metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) was also quantifiable in 19 of 34 (55.9%) subjects at week 4 and seven of 12 (58.3%) subjects at week 8. The serum concentrations for MC1080 ranged from 20-75 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Metabolism Calcipotriene: Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid and occurs in the liver. The primary metabolites of calcipotriene are less potent than the parent compound. Calcipotriene is metabolized to MC1046 (the alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone analogue of calcipotriene), which is metabolized further to MC1080 (a saturated ketone analogue). MC1080 is the major metabolite in plasma. MC1080 is slowly metabolized to calcitroic acid. Betamethasone dipropionate: Betamethasone dipropionate is metabolized to betamethasone 17-propionate and betamethasone, including the 6beta-hydroxy derivatives of those compounds by hydrolysis. Betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) is the primary metabolite."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility When calcipotriene was applied topically to mice for up to 24 months at dosages of 3, 10 and 30 mcg/kg/day (9, 30 and 90 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. A 104-week oral carcinogenicity study was conducted with calcipotriene in male and female rats at doses of 1, 5 and 15 mcg/kg/day (6, 30, and 90 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively). Beginning week 71, the dosage for high-dose animals of both genders was reduced to 10 mcg/kg/day (60 mcg/m 2 /day). A treatment-related increase in benign C-cell adenomas was observed in the thyroid of females that received 15 mcg/kg/day. A treatment-related increase in benign pheochromocytomas was observed in the adrenal glands of males that received 15 mcg/kg/day. No other statistically significant differences in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. The relevance of these findings to patients is unknown. When betamethasone dipropionate was applied topically to CD-1 mice for up to 24 months at dosages approximating 1.3, 4.2 and 8.5 mcg/kg/day in females, and 1.3, 4.2, and 12.9 mcg/kg/day in males (up to 26 mcg/m 2 /day and 39 mcg/m 2 /day, in females and males, respectively), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. When betamethasone dipropionate was administered via oral gavage to male and female Sprague Dawley rats for up to 24 months at dosages of 20, 60, and 200 mcg/kg/day (120, 360, and 1200 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. Calcipotriene did not elicit any genotoxic effects in the Ames mutagenicity assay, the mouse lymphoma TK locus assay, the human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse micronucleus test. Betamethasone dipropionate did not elicit any genotoxic effects in the Ames mutagenicity assay, the mouse lymphoma TK locus assay, or in the rat micronucleus test. Studies in rats with oral doses of up to 54 mcg/kg/day (324 mcg/m 2 /day) of calcipotriene indicated no impairment of fertility or general reproductive performance. Studies in male rats at oral doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (1200 mcg/m 2 /day), and in female rats at oral doses of up to 1000 mcg/kg/ day (6000 mcg/m 2 /day), of betamethasone dipropionate indicated no impairment of fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Clinical Trials Conducted in Subjects 18 years and older with Plaque Psoriasis In an international, multi-center, double-blind, vehicle- and active-controlled, parallel-group trial, 1603 subjects with mild to very severe plaque psoriasis on trunk and limbs were treated once daily for 4 weeks. Subjects were randomized to one of four treatment arms: calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment, calcipotriene hydrate 50 mcg/g in the same vehicle, betamethasone dipropionate 0.64 mg/g in the same vehicle, and vehicle alone. The mean age of the subjects was 48.4 years and 60.5% were male. Most subjects had disease of moderate severity at baseline. Efficacy was assessed as the proportion of subjects with absent or very mild disease according to the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment of Disease Severity at end of treatment (4 weeks). \u201cAbsent\u201d disease was defined as no evidence of redness, thickness, or scaling. \u201cVery mild disease\u201d was defined as controlled disease, but not entirely cleared: lesions with some discoloration with absolutely minimal thickness, i.e. the edges to the lesion(s) could just be felt. Table 3 contains the response rates for this trial.

In addition to the pivotal trial (N = 490), four randomized, double-blind, vehicle- or active-controlled, parallel-group trials were conducted and provided supportive evidence of efficacy. These trials included a total of 1058 subjects treated with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment once daily for up to 4 weeks. Clinical Trial Conducted in Subjects 12 to 17 years with Plaque Psoriasis A prospective, uncontrolled trial (N=33) was conducted in pediatric subjects ages 12 to 17 years with plaque psoriasis involving 5-30% of the body surface area. Approximately 91% of subjects had moderate disease at baseline. Subjects were treated once daily for up to 4 weeks with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. All subjects were evaluated for safety including calcium metabolism (N=33) and 32 subjects were evaluated for HPA axis suppression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In humans, the natural supply of vitamin D depends mainly on exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun for conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) in the skin. Calcipotriene is a synthetic analog of vitamin D 3 . Clinical studies with radiolabelled calcipotriene ointment, USP indicate that approximately 6% (\u00b1 3%, SD) of the applied dose of calcipotriene is absorbed systemically when the ointment is applied topically to psoriasis plaques or 5% (\u00b1 2.6%, SD) when applied to normal skin, and much of the absorbed active is converted to inactive metabolites within 24 hours of application. Vitamin D and its metabolites are transported in the blood, bound to specific plasma proteins. The active form of the vitamin, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (calcitriol), is known to be recycled via the liver and excreted in the bile. Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid, and occurs via a similar pathway to the natural hormone. The primary metabolites are much less potent than the parent compound. There is evidence that maternal 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (calcitriol) may enter the fetal circulation, but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. The systemic disposition of calcipotriene is expected to be similar to that of the naturally occurring vitamin."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "CLINICAL STUDIES Adequate and well-controlled trials of patients treated with calcipotriene ointment USP, 0.005% have demonstrated improvement usually beginning after 2 weeks of therapy. This improvement continued in patients using calcipotriene once daily and twice daily. After 8 weeks of once daily calcipotriene, 56.7% of patients showed at least marked improvements (6.4% showed complete clearing). After 8 weeks of twice daily calcipotriene, 70% of patients showed at least marked improvement (11.3% showed complete clearing). Subtracting percentages of patients using placebo (vehicle only) from percentages of patients using calcipotriene who had at least marked improvements after 8 weeks yields 39.9% for once daily and 49.6% for twice daily. This adjustment for placebo effect indicates that what might appear to be differences between once and twice daily use may reflect differences in the studies independent from the frequency of dosing. Although there was a numerical difference in comparison across studies, twice daily dosing has not been shown to be superior in efficacy to once daily dosing. Over 400 patients have been treated in open label clinical studies of calcipotriene for periods of up to one year. In half of these studies, patients who previously had not responded well to calcipotriene were excluded. The adverse reaction in these extended studies included skin irritation in approximately 25% of patients and worsening of psoriasis in approximately 10% of patients. In one of these open label studies, half of the patients no longer required calcipotriene by 16 weeks of treatment, because of satisfactory therapeutic results."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Use of calcipotriene may cause irritation of lesions and surrounding uninvolved skin. If irritation develops, calcipotriene should be discontinued. For external use only. Keep out of the reach of children. Always wash hands thoroughly after use. Reversible elevation of serum calcium has occurred with use of calcipotriene. If elevation in serum calcium outside the normal range should occur, discontinue treatment until normal calcium levels are restored. Information for Patients Patients using calcipotriene should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the face or eyes. As with any topical medication, patients should wash their hands after application. 2. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. 3. Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse reactions. 4. Patients that apply calcipotriene to exposed portions of the body should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight. (including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc.) Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility When calcipotriene was applied topically to mice for up to 24 months at dosages of 3, 10 and 30 mcg/kg/day (corresponding to 9, 30 and 90 mcg/m 2 /day), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. In a study in which albino hairless mice were exposed to both UVR and topically applied calcipotriene, a reduction in the time required for UVR to induce the formation of skin tumors was observed (statistically significant in males only), suggesting that calcipotriene may enhance the effect of UVR to induce skin tumors. Patients that apply calcipotriene to exposed portions of the body should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight (including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc.). Physicians may wish to avoid use of phototherapy in patients that use calcipotriene ointment USP, 0.005%. Calcipotriene did not elicit any mutagenic effects in an Ames mutagenicity assay, a mouse lymphoma TK locus assay, a human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay, or in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Studies in rats at doses up to 54 mcg/kg/day (324 mcg/m 2 /day) of calcipotriene indicated no impairment of fertility or general reproductive performance. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Studies of teratogenicity were done by the oral route where bioavailability is expected to be approximately 40 to 60% of the administered dose. In rabbits, increased maternal and fetal toxicity were noted at a dosage 12 mcg/kg/day (132 mcg/m 2 /day); a dosage of 36 mcg/kg/day (396 mcg/m 2 /day) resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of incomplete ossification of the pubic bones and forelimb phalanges of fetuses. In a rat study, a dosage of 54 mcg/kg/day (318 mcg/m 2 /day) resulted in a significantly increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities (enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs). The enlarged fontanelles are most likely due to calcipotriene's effect upon calcium metabolism. The estimated maternal and fetal no-effect exposure levels in the rat (43.2 mcg/m 2 /day) and rabbit (17.6 mcg/m 2 /day) studies are approximately equal to the expected human systemic exposure level (18.5 mcg/m 2 /day) from dermal application. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, calcipotriene ointment should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether calcipotriene is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when calcipotriene ointment, 0.005% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of calcipotriene in pediatric patients have not been established. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at greater risk than adults of systemic adverse effects when they are treated with topical medication. Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of calcipotriene ointment, USP approximately 12% were 65 or older, while approximately 4% were 75 and over. The results of an analysis of severity of skin-related adverse events showed a statistically significant difference for subjects over 65 years (more severe) compared to those under 65 years (less severe)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypercalcemia and Hypercalciuria: Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been reported. If either occurs, discontinue until parameters of calcium metabolism normalize. ( 5.1 ) Effects on Endocrine System: Can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency during and after withdrawal of treatment. Risk factors include the use of high-potency topical corticosteroid, use over a large surface area or to areas under occlusion, prolonged use, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and use in pediatric patients. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.2 , 8.4 ) Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: May increase the risk of cataracts and glaucoma. If visual symptoms occur, consider referral to an ophthalmologist. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hypercalcemia and Hypercalciuria Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed with use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension. If hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria develop, discontinue treatment until parameters of calcium metabolism have normalized. The incidence of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria following calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension treatment of more than 8 weeks has not been evaluated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 5.2 Effects on Endocrine System Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Suppression Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid. The following trials evaluated the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on HPA axis suppression: In a trial evaluating the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension and calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the HPA axis, 32 adult subjects applied both calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp and calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression was identified in 5 of 32 subjects (16%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in 2 of 11 subjects (18%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks. In another trial, 36 adult subjects applied calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the body and scalp and 7 subjects applied calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the body. Adrenal suppression occurred in 3 out of 43 subjects (7%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in none of the 36 subjects who continued treatment for 8 weeks [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. In two trials, the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the HPA axis were evaluated in 31 and 30 pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old who applied calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp and the scalp/body, respectively. Adrenal suppression occurred in 1 of 30 evaluable subjects (3%) after 4 weeks of treatment (scalp) and 5 of 31 evaluable subjects (16%) after up to 8 weeks of treatment (scalp and body) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Cushing's Syndrome and Hyperglycemia Cushing's syndrome and hyperglycemia may occur due to the systemic effects of the topical corticosteroid. These complications are rare and generally occur after prolonged exposure to excessively large doses, especially of high-potency topical corticosteroids. Additional Considerations for Endocrine Adverse Reactions Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to a topical corticosteroid is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Calcipotriene Allergic contact dermatitis has been observed with use of topical calcipotriene. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing. 5.5 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids, including calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension, may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported with the postmarketing use of topical corticosteroid products [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Avoid contact of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension with eyes. Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension may cause eye irritation. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation."

Clinical Trials Conducted in Subjects 12 to 17 years with Psoriasis of the Scalp In two uncontrolled clinical trials, 109 subjects aged 12 to 17 years with plaque psoriasis of the scalp applied calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension once daily for up to 8 weeks. The median weekly dose was 40 grams. Adverse reactions included acne, acneiform dermatitis and application site pruritus (0.9% each) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Postmarketing reports for local adverse reactions to topical corticosteroids included atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, itching, dryness, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Ophthalmic adverse reactions of cataracts, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and central serous chorioretinopathy have been reported during use of topical corticosteroids, including topical betamethasone products."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension are not sufficient to evaluate a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Although there are no available data on use of the calcipotriene component in pregnant women, systemic exposure to calcipotriene after topical administration of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension is likely to be low [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Observational studies suggest an increased risk of having low birth weight infants with the maternal use of potent or super potent topical corticosteroids (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women that calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension may increase the potential risk of having a low birth weight infant and to use calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs (see Data ) . Oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis had no apparent effects on embryo-fetal development. Subcutaneous administration of betamethasone dipropionate to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, and fetal malformations (cleft palate and crooked or short tail) (see Data ) . The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposures of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate observed in animal studies to the systemic exposures that would be expected in humans after topical use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Available observational studies in pregnant women did not identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, preterm delivery, or fetal mortality with the use of topical corticosteroids of any potency. However, when the dispensed amount of potent or super potent topical corticosteroids exceeded 300 grams during the entire pregnancy, maternal use was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight in infants. Animal Data Embryo-fetal development studies with calcipotriene were performed by the oral route in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats received dosages of 0, 6, 18, or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6 to 15 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). There were no apparent effects on maternal survival, behavior, or body weight gain, no effects on litter parameters, and no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses. Fetuses from dams dosed at 54 mcg/kg/day exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. Pregnant rabbits were dosed daily with calcipotriene at exposures of 0, 4, 12, or 36 mcg/kg/day (0, 48, 144, and 432 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6 to 18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Mean maternal body weight gain was reduced in animals dosed at 12 or 36 mcg/kg/day. The incidence of fetal deaths was increased in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day; reduced fetal weight was also observed in this group. The incidence of major malformations among fetuses was not affected. An increase in the incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including incomplete ossification of sternebrae, pubic bones, and forelimb phalanges, was observed in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day. Embryo-fetal development studies with betamethasone dipropionate were performed via subcutaneous injection in mice and rabbits. Pregnant mice were administered doses of 0, 156, 625, or 2500 mcg/kg/day (0, 468, 1875, and 7500 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 7 through 13 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, malformations (increased incidence of the cleft palate and crooked or short tail), and minor skeletal abnormalities (delayed ossification of vertebra and sternebrae). Fetal toxicity was observed at the lowest exposure that was evaluated (156 mcg/kg/day). Pregnant rabbits were injected subcutaneously at dosages of 0, 0.625, 2.5, and 10 mcg/kg/day (0, 7.5, 30, and 120 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6 through 18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, external malformations (including malformed ears, cleft palate, umbilical hernia, kinked tail, club foot, and club hand), and skeletal malformations (including absence of phalanges of the first digit and cranial dysplasia) at dosages of 2.5 mcg/kg/day and above. Calcipotriene was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 6, 18 or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 15 through day 20 postpartum. No remarkable effects were observed on any parameter, including survival, behavior, body weight, litter parameters, or the ability to nurse or rear pups. Betamethasone dipropionate was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day (0, 600, 1800, and 6000 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 6 through day 20 postpartum. Mean maternal body weight was significantly reduced on gestation day 20 in animals dosed at 300 and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean duration of gestation was slightly, but statistically significantly, increased at 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean percentage of pups that survived to day 4 was reduced in relation to dosage. On lactation day 5, the percentage of pups with a reflex to right themselves when placed on their back was significantly reduced at 1000 mcg/kg/day. No effects on the ability of pups to learn were observed, and the ability of the offspring of treated rats to reproduce was not affected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topically administered calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Concentrations of calcipotriene in plasma are low after topical administration, and therefore, concentrations in human milk are likely to be low [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. It is not known whether topical administration of large amounts of betamethasone dipropionate could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension for the treatment of plaque psoriasis of the scalp have been established in pediatric patients age 12 to 17 years. The use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and from uncontrolled trials in pediatric subjects that enrolled 109 adolescents with moderate psoriasis of the scalp. After 4 weeks of once daily treatment with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension, HPA axis suppression was observed in 3% of adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and 16% of adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and body [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical corticosteroids. Pediatric patients are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency with the use of topical corticosteroids including calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Rare systemic toxicities such as Cushing's syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids. Local adverse reactions including striae have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Additional pediatric use information is approved for LEO Pharma A/S's Taclonex \u00ae (calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate) Topical Suspension. However, due to LEO Pharma A/S's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in plaque psoriasis on non-scalp areas included 124 subjects who were 65 years of age or older, and 36 were 75 years of age or older. Clinical studies of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in subjects with psoriasis of the scalp included 334 subjects who were 65 years or older and 84 subjects who were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified any differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension combines the pharmacological effects of calcipotriene hydrate as a synthetic vitamin D 3 analog and betamethasone dipropionate as a synthetic corticosteroid. However, while their pharmacologic and clinical effects are known, the exact mechanisms of their actions in the treatment of plaque psoriasis of the scalp and body are unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression: HPA axis suppression was evaluated in four trials (Trial A, B, C, and D) following the application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension. In all these trials, adrenal suppression was defined by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level \u226418 mcg/dL. In Trial A, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=32) with extensive psoriasis involving at least 30% of the scalp and, in total, 15 to 30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body for 4 to 8 weeks. Adrenal suppression was observed in 5 of 32 subjects (16%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in 2 of 11 subjects (18%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks. In Trial B, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=43) with extensive psoriasis involving 15 to 30% of the body surface area (including the scalp). Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension to the body (including the scalp in 36 out of 43 subjects) for 4 to 8 weeks. Adrenal suppression was observed in 3 out of 43 subjects (7%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in none of the 36 subjects (0%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks. In Trial C, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years (N=30) with plaque psoriasis of the scalp involving at least 20% of the scalp area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension to the affected area on the scalp for up to 8 weeks. Adrenal suppression was observed in 1 of 30 evaluable subjects (3%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in no subjects (0%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . In Trial D, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in a subset of pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years (N=31) with plaque psoriasis of the scalp and body involving 10% to 29% of the body surface area. Adrenal suppression was observed in 5 of 31 subjects (16%): 3 subjects after 4 weeks of treatment, 1 subject after 8 weeks of treatment, and 1 subject after both 4 and 8 weeks of treatment [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Effects on Calcium Metabolism The effect on calcium metabolism was evaluated following the application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension (these trials are described above). In Trial A, elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in two subjects (one at 4 weeks and one at 8 weeks). In Trial B, there was no change in mean serum or urinary calcium levels. Elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in two subjects (one at 4 weeks and one at 8 weeks). In Trial C (N=109), including 31 subjects with at least 20% scalp involvement and 78 subjects with at least 10% scalp involvement, no cases of hypercalcemia and no clinically relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The systemic effect of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in psoriasis was investigated in Trials A and B [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. In Trial A, the serum levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 and 8 weeks of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body. Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate were below the lower limit of quantification in all serum samples of the 34 subjects evaluated. However, one major metabolite of calcipotriene (MC1080) was quantifiable in 10 of 34 (29%) subjects at week 4 and in 5 of 12 (42%) subjects at week 8. The major metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone 17propionate (B17P) was also quantifiable in 19 of 34 (56%) subjects at week 4 and 7 of 12 (58%) subjects at week 8. The serum concentrations for MC1080 ranged from 20-75 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. In Trial B, the plasma levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 weeks of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension. Calcipotriene and its metabolite MC1080 were below the lower limit of quantification in all plasma samples. Betamethasone dipropionate was quantifiable in 4 of 43 (9) subjects. The metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate (B17P) was quantifiable in 16 of 43 (37%) subjects. The plasma concentrations of betamethasone dipropionate ranged from 30.9-63.5 pg/mL and that of its metabolite betamethasone 17-propionate ranged from 30.5 to 257 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Elimination Metabolism Calcipotriene: Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid and occurs in the liver. The primary metabolites of calcipotriene are less potent than the parent compound. Calcipotriene is metabolized to MC1046 (the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone analog of calcipotriene), which is metabolized further to MC1080 (a saturated ketone analog). MC1080 is the major metabolite in plasma. MC1080 is slowly metabolized to calcitroic acid. Betamethasone dipropionate : Betamethasone dipropionate is metabolized to betamethasone 17-propionate and betamethasone, including the 6\u03b2-hydroxy derivatives of those compounds by hydrolysis. Betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) is the primary metabolite.

Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension to the body (including the scalp in 36 out of 43 subjects) for 4 to 8 weeks. Adrenal suppression was observed in 3 out of 43 subjects (7%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in none of the 36 subjects (0%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks. In Trial C, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years (N=30) with plaque psoriasis of the scalp involving at least 20% of the scalp area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension to the affected area on the scalp for up to 8 weeks. Adrenal suppression was observed in 1 of 30 evaluable subjects (3%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in no subjects (0%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . In Trial D, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in a subset of pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years (N=31) with plaque psoriasis of the scalp and body involving 10% to 29% of the body surface area. Adrenal suppression was observed in 5 of 31 subjects (16%): 3 subjects after 4 weeks of treatment, 1 subject after 8 weeks of treatment, and 1 subject after both 4 and 8 weeks of treatment [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Effects on Calcium Metabolism The effect on calcium metabolism was evaluated following the application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension (these trials are described above). In Trial A, elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in two subjects (one at 4 weeks and one at 8 weeks). In Trial B, there was no change in mean serum or urinary calcium levels. Elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in two subjects (one at 4 weeks and one at 8 weeks). In Trial C (N=109), including 31 subjects with at least 20% scalp involvement and 78 subjects with at least 10% scalp involvement, no cases of hypercalcemia and no clinically relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The systemic effect of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in psoriasis was investigated in Trials A and B [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. In Trial A, the serum levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 and 8 weeks of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body. Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate were below the lower limit of quantification in all serum samples of the 34 subjects evaluated. However, one major metabolite of calcipotriene (MC1080) was quantifiable in 10 of 34 (29%) subjects at week 4 and in 5 of 12 (42%) subjects at week 8. The major metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone 17propionate (B17P) was also quantifiable in 19 of 34 (56%) subjects at week 4 and 7 of 12 (58%) subjects at week 8. The serum concentrations for MC1080 ranged from 20-75 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. In Trial B, the plasma levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 weeks of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension. Calcipotriene and its metabolite MC1080 were below the lower limit of quantification in all plasma samples. Betamethasone dipropionate was quantifiable in 4 of 43 (9) subjects. The metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate (B17P) was quantifiable in 16 of 43 (37%) subjects. The plasma concentrations of betamethasone dipropionate ranged from 30.9-63.5 pg/mL and that of its metabolite betamethasone 17-propionate ranged from 30.5 to 257 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Elimination Metabolism Calcipotriene: Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid and occurs in the liver. The primary metabolites of calcipotriene are less potent than the parent compound. Calcipotriene is metabolized to MC1046 (the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone analog of calcipotriene), which is metabolized further to MC1080 (a saturated ketone analog). MC1080 is the major metabolite in plasma. MC1080 is slowly metabolized to calcitroic acid. Betamethasone dipropionate : Betamethasone dipropionate is metabolized to betamethasone 17-propionate and betamethasone, including the 6\u03b2-hydroxy derivatives of those compounds by hydrolysis. Betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) is the primary metabolite. Additional pediatric use information is approved for LEO Pharma A/S's Taclonex \u00ae (calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate) Topical Suspension. However, due to LEO Pharma A/S's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

A 104-week oral carcinogenicity study was conducted with calcipotriene in male and female rats at doses of 1, 5 and 15 mcg/kg/day (6, 30, and 90 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively). Beginning week 71, the dosage for high-dose animals of both genders was reduced to 10 mcg/kg/day (60 mcg/m 2 /day). A treatment-related increase in benign C-cell adenomas was observed in the thyroid of females that received 15 mcg/kg/day. A treatment-related increase in benign pheochromocytomas was observed in the adrenal glands of males that received 15 mcg/kg/day. No other statistically significant differences in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. The relevance of these findings to patients is unknown. When betamethasone dipropionate was applied topically to CD-1 mice for up to 24 months at dosages approximating 1.3, 4.2, and 8.5 mcg/kg/day in females, and 1.3, 4.2, and 12.9 mcg/kg/day in males (up to 26 mcg/m 2 /day and 39 mcg/m 2 /day, in females and males, respectively), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. When betamethasone dipropionate was administered via oral gavage to male and female Sprague Dawley rats for up to 24 months at dosages of 20, 60, and 200 mcg/kg/day (120, 360, and 1200 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. Calcipotriene did not elicit any genotoxic effects in the Ames mutagenicity assay, the mouse lymphoma TK locus assay, the human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse micronucleus test. Betamethasone dipropionate did not elicit any genotoxic effects in the Ames mutagenicity assay, the mouse lymphoma TK locus assay, or in the rat micronucleus test. Studies in rats with oral doses of up to 54 mcg/kg/day (324 mcg/m 2 /day) of calcipotriene indicated no impairment of fertility or general reproductive performance. Studies in male rats at oral doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (1200 mcg/m 2 /day), and in female rats at oral doses of up to 1000 mcg/kg/day (6000 mcg/m 2 /day), of betamethasone dipropionate indicated no impairment of fertility."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypercalcemia and Hypercalciuria: Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been reported. If either occurs, discontinue until parameters of calcium metabolism normalize. ( 5.1 ) Effects on Endocrine System: Can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency during and after withdrawal of treatment. Risk factors include the use of high-potency topical corticosteroid, use over a large surface area or to areas under occlusion, prolonged use, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and use in pediatric patients. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.2 , 8.4 ) Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: May increase the risk of cataracts and glaucoma. If visual symptoms occur, consider referral to an ophthalmologist. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hypercalcemia and Hypercalciuria Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed with use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension. If hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria develop, discontinue treatment until parameters of calcium metabolism have normalized. The incidence of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria following calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension treatment of more than 8 weeks has not been evaluated [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . 5.2 Effects on Endocrine System Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Suppression Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid. The following trials evaluated the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on HPA axis suppression: In a trial evaluating the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension and calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the HPA axis, 32 adult subjects applied both calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp and calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression was identified in 5 of 32 subjects (16%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in 2 of 11 subjects (18%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks. In another trial, 36 adult subjects applied calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the body and scalp and 7 subjects applied calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the body. Adrenal suppression occurred in 3 out of 43 subjects (7%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in none of the 36 subjects who continued treatment for 8 weeks [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . In two trials, the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the HPA axis were evaluated in 31 and 30 pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old who applied calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp and the scalp/body, respectively. Adrenal suppression occurred in 1 of 30 evaluable subjects (3%) after 4 weeks of treatment (scalp) and 5 of 31 evaluable subjects (16%) after up to 8 weeks of treatment (scalp and body) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Cushing\u2019s Syndrome and Hyperglycemia Cushing\u2019s syndrome and hyperglycemia may occur due to the systemic effects of the topical corticosteroid. These complications are rare and generally occur after prolonged exposure to excessively large doses, especially of high-potency topical corticosteroids. Additional Considerations for Endocrine Adverse Reactions Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to a topical corticosteroid is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Calcipotriene Allergic contact dermatitis has been observed with use of topical calcipotriene. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing. 5.5 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids, including calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension, may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported with the postmarketing use of topical corticosteroid products [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Avoid contact of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension with eyes. Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension may cause eye irritation. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation."

Clinical Trials Conducted in Subjects 18 years and older with Psoriasis of the Body In randomized, multicenter, vehicle- and/or active controlled clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis on non-scalp areas, 824 subjects applied calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension once daily for 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . The median weekly dose was 22.6 grams. There were no adverse reactions that occurred in \u22651% of subjects treated with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension and at a rate higher than in subjects treated with vehicle. Other less common adverse reactions (<1% but >0.1%) were, in decreasing order of incidence: rash and folliculitis. Clinical Trials Conducted in Subjects 12 to 17 years with Psoriasis of the Scalp In two uncontrolled clinical trials, 109 subjects aged 12 to 17 years with plaque psoriasis of the scalp applied calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension once daily for up to 8 weeks. The median weekly dose was 40 grams. Adverse reactions included acne, acneiform dermatitis and application site pruritus (0.9% each) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] .

Postmarketing reports for local adverse reactions to topical corticosteroids included atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, itching, dryness, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Ophthalmic adverse reactions of cataracts, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and central serous chorioretinopathy have been reported during use of topical corticosteroids, including topical betamethasone products."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension are not sufficient to evaluate a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Although there are no available data on use of the calcipotriene component in pregnant women, systemic exposure to calcipotriene after topical administration of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension is likely to be low [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Observational studies suggest an increased risk of having low birth weight infants with the maternal use of potent or super potent topical corticosteroids (see Data ). Advise pregnant women that calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension may increase the potential risk of having a low birth weight infant and to use calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs (see Data ). Oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis had no apparent effects on embryo-fetal development. Subcutaneous administration of betamethasone dipropionate to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, and fetal malformations (cleft palate and crooked or short tail) (see Data ). The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposures of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate observed in animal studies to the systemic exposures that would be expected in humans after topical use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Available observational studies in pregnant women did not identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, preterm delivery, or fetal mortality with the use of topical corticosteroids of any potency. However, when the dispensed amount of potent or super potent topical corticosteroids exceeded 300 grams during the entire pregnancy, maternal use was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight in infants. Animal Data Embryo-fetal development studies with calcipotriene were performed by the oral route in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats received dosages of 0, 6, 18, or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-15 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). There were no apparent effects on maternal survival, behavior, or body weight gain, no effects on litter parameters, and no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses. Fetuses from dams dosed at 54 mcg/kg/day exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. Pregnant rabbits were dosed daily with calcipotriene at exposures of 0, 4, 12, or 36 mcg/kg/day (0, 48, 144, and 432 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Mean maternal body weight gain was reduced in animals dosed at 12 or 36 mcg/kg/day. The incidence of fetal deaths was increased in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day; reduced fetal weight was also observed in this group. The incidence of major malformations among fetuses was not affected. An increase in the incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including incomplete ossification of sternebrae, pubic bones, and forelimb phalanges, was observed in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day. Embryo-fetal development studies with betamethasone dipropionate were performed via subcutaneous injection in mice and rabbits. Pregnant mice were administered doses of 0, 156, 625, or 2500 mcg/kg/day (0, 468, 1875, and 7500 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 7 through 13 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, malformations (increased incidence of the cleft palate and crooked or short tail), and minor skeletal abnormalities (delayed ossification of vertebra and sternebrae). Fetal toxicity was observed at the lowest exposure that was evaluated (156 mcg/kg/day). Pregnant rabbits were injected subcutaneously at dosages of 0, 0.625, 2.5, and 10 mcg/kg/day (0, 7.5, 30, and 120 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6 through 18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, external malformations (including malformed ears, cleft palate, umbilical hernia, kinked tail, club foot, and club hand), and skeletal malformations (including absence of phalanges of the first digit and cranial dysplasia) at dosages of 2.5 mcg/kg/day and above. Calcipotriene was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 6, 18 or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 15 through day 20 postpartum. No remarkable effects were observed on any parameter, including survival, behavior, body weight, litter parameters, or the ability to nurse or rear pups. Betamethasone dipropionate was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day (0, 600, 1800, and 6000 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 6 through day 20 postpartum. Mean maternal body weight was significantly reduced on gestation day 20 in animals dosed at 300 and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean duration of gestation was slightly, but statistically significantly, increased at 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean percentage of pups that survived to day 4 was reduced in relation to dosage. On lactation day 5, the percentage of pups with a reflex to right themselves when placed on their back was significantly reduced at 1000 mcg/kg/day. No effects on the ability of pups to learn were observed, and the ability of the offspring of treated rats to reproduce was not affected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topically administered calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Concentrations of calcipotriene in plasma are low after topical administration, and therefore, concentrations in human milk are likely to be low [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. It is not known whether topical administration of large amounts of betamethasone dipropionate could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension for the treatment of plaque psoriasis of the scalp has been established in pediatric patients age 12 to 17 years. The use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and from uncontrolled trials in pediatric subjects that enrolled 109 adolescents with moderate psoriasis of the scalp. After 4 weeks of once daily treatment with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension, HPA axis suppression was observed in 3% of adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and 16% of adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and body. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical corticosteroids. Pediatric patients are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency with the use of topical corticosteroids including calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Rare systemic toxicities such as Cushing\u2019s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids. Local adverse reactions including striae have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Additional pediatric use information is approved for LEO Pharma A/S\u2019s Taclonex\u00ae (calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate) Topical Suspension. However, due to LEO Pharma A/S\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in plaque psoriasis on non-scalp areas included 124 subjects who were 65 years of age or older, and 36 were 75 years of age or older. Clinical studies of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in subjects with psoriasis of the scalp included 334 subjects who were 65 years or older and 84 subjects who were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified any differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension for the treatment of plaque psoriasis of the scalp has been established in pediatric patients age 12 to 17 years. The use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and from uncontrolled trials in pediatric subjects that enrolled 109 adolescents with moderate psoriasis of the scalp. After 4 weeks of once daily treatment with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension, HPA axis suppression was observed in 3% of adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and 16% of adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and body. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical corticosteroids. Pediatric patients are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency with the use of topical corticosteroids including calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Rare systemic toxicities such as Cushing\u2019s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids. Local adverse reactions including striae have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Additional pediatric use information is approved for LEO Pharma A/S\u2019s Taclonex\u00ae (calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate) Topical Suspension. However, due to LEO Pharma A/S\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension combines the pharmacological effects of calcipotriene as a synthetic vitamin D 3 analog and betamethasone dipropionate as a synthetic corticosteroid. However, while their pharmacologic and clinical effects are known, the exact mechanisms of their actions in the treatment of plaque psoriasis of the scalp and body are unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression: HPA axis suppression was evaluated in four trials (Trial A, B, C, and D) following the application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension. In all these trials, adrenal suppression was defined by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level \u226418 mcg/dL. In Trial A, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=32) with extensive psoriasis involving at least 30% of the scalp and, in total, 15-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body for 4 to 8 weeks. Adrenal suppression was observed in 5 of 32 subjects (16%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in 2 of 11 subjects (18%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks. In Trial B, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=43) with extensive psoriasis involving 15-30% of the body surface area (including the scalp). Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension to the body (including the scalp in 36 out of 43 subjects) for 4 to 8 weeks. Adrenal suppression was observed in 3 out of 43 subjects (7%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in none of the 36 subjects (0%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks. In Trial C, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years (N=30) with plaque psoriasis of the scalp involving at least 20% of the scalp area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension to the affected area on the scalp for up to 8 weeks. Adrenal suppression was observed in 1 of 30 evaluable subjects (3%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in no subjects (0%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . In Trial D, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in a subset of pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years (N=31) with plaque psoriasis of the scalp and body involving 10% to 29% of the body surface area. Adrenal suppression was observed in 5 of 31 subjects (16%): 3 subjects after 4 weeks of treatment, 1 subject after 8 weeks of treatment, and 1 subject after both 4 and 8 weeks of treatment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Effects on Calcium Metabolism The effect on calcium metabolism was evaluated following the application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension (these trials are described above). In Trial A, elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in two subjects (one at 4 weeks and one at 8 weeks). In Trial B, there was no change in mean serum or urinary calcium levels. Elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in two subjects (one at 4 weeks and one at 8 weeks). In Trial C (N=109), including 31 subjects with at least 20% scalp involvement and 78 subjects with at least 10% scalp involvement, no cases of hypercalcemia and no clinically relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The systemic effect of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in psoriasis was investigated in Trials A and B [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . In Trial A, the serum levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 and 8 weeks of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body. Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate were below the lower limit of quantification in all serum samples of the 34 subjects evaluated. However, one major metabolite of calcipotriene (MC1080) was quantifiable in 10 of 34 (29%) subjects at week 4 and in 5 of 12 (42%) subjects at week 8. The major metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) was also quantifiable in 19 of 34 (56%) subjects at week 4 and 7 of 12 (58%) subjects at week 8. The serum concentrations for MC1080 ranged from 20-75 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. In Trial B, the plasma levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 weeks of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension. Calcipotriene and its metabolite MC1080 were below the lower limit of quantification in all plasma samples. Betamethasone dipropionate was quantifiable in 4 of 43 (9) subjects. The metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate (B17P) was quantifiable in 16 of 43 (37%) subjects. The plasma concentrations of betamethasone dipropionate ranged from 30.9-63.5 pg/mL and that of its metabolite betamethasone 17-propionate ranged from 30.5-257 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Elimination Metabolism Calcipotriene: Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid and occurs in the liver. The primary metabolites of calcipotriene are less potent than the parent compound. Calcipotriene is metabolized to MC1046 (the \u03b1,\u00df-unsaturated ketone analog of calcipotriene), which is metabolized further to MC1080 (a saturated ketone analog). MC1080 is the major metabolite in plasma. MC1080 is slowly metabolized to calcitroic acid. Betamethasone dipropionate: Betamethasone dipropionate is metabolized to betamethasone 17-propionate and betamethasone, including the 6\u00df-hydroxy derivatives of those compounds by hydrolysis. Betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) is the primary metabolite.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In humans, the natural supply of vitamin D depends mainly on exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun for conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) in the skin. Calcipotriene is a synthetic analog of vitamin D 3 . Although the precise mechanism of calcipotriene\u2019s antipsoriatic action is not fully understood, in vitro evidence suggests that calcipotriene is roughly equipotent to the natural vitamin in its effects on proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cell types. Calcipotriene has also been shown, in animal studies, to be 100-200 times less potent in its effects on calcium utilization than the natural hormone. Clinical studies with radiolabelled calcipotriene solution indicate that less than 1% of the applied dose of calcipotriene is absorbed through the scalp when the solution (2.0 mL) is applied topically to normal skin or psoriasis plaques (160 cm 2 ) for 12 hours, and that much of the absorbed calcipotriene is converted to inactive metabolites within 24 hours of application. Vitamin D and its metabolites are transported in the blood, bound to specific plasma proteins. The active form of the vitamin, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (calcitriol), is known to be recycled via the liver and excreted in the bile. Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid, and occurs via a similar pathway to the natural hormone. The primary metabolites are much less potent than the parent compound. There is evidence that maternal 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (calcitriol) may enter the fetal circulation, but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. The systemic disposition of calcipotriene is expected to be similar to that of the naturally occurring vitamin."

If irritation develops, Calcipotriene Topical Solution, 0.005% (Scalp Solution), should be discontinued. For external use only. Keep out of the reach of children. Always wash hands thoroughly after use. Reversible elevation of serum calcium has occurred with use of topical calcipotriene. If elevation in serum calcium outside the normal range should occur, discontinue treatment until normal calcium levels are restored. Information for Patients Patients using Calcipotriene Topical Solution, 0.005% (Scalp Solution) should receive the following information and instructions: This medication is to be used only as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the face or eyes. As with any topical medication, patients should wash their hands after application. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. Patients should report to their physician any signs of adverse reactions. Patients that apply Calcipotriene Topical Solution, 0.005% (Scalp Solution) to exposed portions of the body should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight (including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc.) Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility When calcipotriene was applied topically to mice for up to 24 months at dosages of 3, 10 and 30 \u03bcg/kg/day (corresponding to 9, 30 and 90 \u03bcg/m 2 /day), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. In a study in which albino hairless mice were exposed to both UVR and topically applied calcipotriene, a reduction in the time required for UVR to induce the formation of skin tumors was observed (statistically significant in males only), suggesting that calcipotriene may enhance the effect of UVR to induce skin tumors. Patients that apply Calcipotriene Topical Solution, 0.005% (Scalp Solution) to exposed portions of the body should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight (including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc.). Physicians may wish to limit or avoid use of phototherapy in patients that use Calcipotriene Topical Solution, 0.005% (Scalp Solution). Calcipotriene did not elicit any mutagenic effects in an Ames mutagenicity assay, a mouse lymphoma TK locus assay, a human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay, or in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Studies in rats at doses up to 54 \u03bcg/kg/day (324 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) of calcipotriene indicated no impairment of fertility or general reproductive performance. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C Studies of teratogenicity were done by the oral route where bioavailability is expected to be approximately 40-60% of the administered dose. Increased rabbit maternal and fetal toxicity was noted at 12 \u03bcg/kg/day (132 \u03bcg/m 2 /day). Rabbits administered 36 \u03bcg/kg/day (396 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) resulted in fetuses with a significant increase in the incidences of pubic bones, forelimb phalanges, and incomplete bone ossification. In a rat study, oral doses of 54 \u03bcg/kg/day (318 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) resulted in a significantly higher incidence of skeletal abnormalities consisting primarily of enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. The enlarged fontanelles are most likely due to calcipotriene\u2019s effect upon calcium metabolism. The maternal and fetal calculated no-effect exposures in the rat (43.2 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) and rabbit (17.6 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) studies are greater than the expected human systemic exposure level (0.13 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) from dermal application. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Calcipotriene Topical Solution, 0.005% (Scalp Solution), should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers There is evidence that maternal 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (calcitriol) may enter the fetal circulation, but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. The systemic disposition of calcipotriene is expected to be similar to that of the naturally occurring vitamin. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Calcipotriene Topical Solution, 0.005% (Scalp Solution) is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Calcipotriene Topical Solution, 0.005% (Scalp Solution), in pediatric patients have not been specifically established. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at greater risk than adults of systemic adverse effects when they are treated with topical medication. Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of calcipotriene solution, approximately 16% were 65 or older, while approximately 4% were 75 and over. The results of an analysis of severity of skin-related adverse events showed no differences for subjects over 65 years compared to those under 65 years, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

( 6 ) 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Calcipotriene foam was studied in four vehicle-controlled trials. A total of 1094 adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, including 654 exposed to calcipotriene foam, were treated twice daily for 8 weeks. Adverse reactions reported in \u22651% of subjects treated with calcipotriene foam and at a higher incidence than subjects treated with vehicle were application site erythema (2%) and application site pain (3%). The incidence of these adverse reactions was similar between the body and scalp. In an open-label study, 19 pediatric subjects age 12 to less than 17 years applied calcipotriene foam twice daily for 14 days and once on Day 15. Adverse reactions included application site pain, application site pruritus and pruritus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 and 12.3) and Pediatric Use (8.4) ] . In an open-label study, 36 pediatric subjects age 4 to less than 12 years applied calcipotriene foam twice daily for up to 8 weeks. Adverse reactions included application site pain and contact dermatitis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 and 12.3) and Pediatric Use (8.4) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of calcipotriene foam. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Although there are no available data on the drug- associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in pregnant women exposed to calcipotriene foam, systemic exposure to calcipotriene is likely to be low [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 , 12.3) ] . In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs in rats and an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including incomplete ossification of pubic bones and forelimb phalanges in rabbits (see Data ) . The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposure of calcipotriene observed in animal studies to the systemic exposure that would be expected in humans after topical use of calcipotriene foam. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal development studies were conducted with calcipotriene after oral administration in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats received daily oral administration of calcipotriene during the period of organogenesis. Fetuses from dams dosed with 54 mcg/kg/day (318 mcg/m 2 /day) exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities consisting primarily of enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. The enlarged fontanelles are most likely due to calcipotriene's effect upon calcium metabolism. There were no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses. Pregnant rabbits received daily oral administration of calcipotriene during the period of organogenesis. Increased rabbit maternal and fetal toxicity was noted at 12 mcg/kg/day (132 mcg/m 2 /day). Fetuses from does dosed with 36 mcg/kg/day (396 mcg/m 2 /day) exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities including incomplete ossification of pubic bones and forelimb phalanges. There were no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of topically administered calcipotriene in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. After topical administration of calcipotriene foam, concentrations of calcipotriene in plasma are low, and therefore, concentrations in human milk are likely to be low [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from calcipotriene foam or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of calcipotriene foam have been established in pediatric patients age 4 years and older for topical treatment of plaque psoriasis of the scalp and body. Use of calcipotriene foam in this age group is supported by two adequate and well controlled 8-week trials in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older, with additional data from a 15-day open-label safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) study conducted in 19 subjects 12 to less than 17 years of age; and an 8-week open-label safety and PK study in 36 subjects 4 to 11 years of age with psoriasis. Data from 19 subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years and 18 subjects aged 5 to 11 years showed no significant effects on indices of calcium metabolism. Systemic concentrations of calcipotriene were not quantifiable in the two studies in subjects aged 7 years to less than 17 years. [see Clinical Studies (14) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 , 12.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The safety and effectiveness of calcipotriene foam in pediatric patients less than 4 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of calcipotriene foam did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

However, the exact mechanism of action contributing to the clinical efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on Calcium Metabolism In 19 subjects with psoriasis aged 12 to less than 17 years treated with calcipotriene foam two times a day for 15 days, there was no significant effect on indices of calcium metabolism including serum albumin adjusted calcium, urine calcium/creatinine ratio, iPTH, alkaline phosphatase, magnesium and phosphorus. The effects of calcipotriene foam, 0.005%, on calcium metabolism were evaluated in 18 pediatric subjects 5 to 11 years of age receiving calcipotriene foam administered twice daily for a minimum of 14 days (mean: 56 days, range: 14 to 69 days). These subjects had plaque psoriasis involving an average of 10% of the body surface area (BSA) (range: 0.5%-36.5%). There was no relationship between urinary calcium/creatinine ratio (comparing Week 2 to Baseline) and % BSA treated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The systemic absorption of calcipotriene in subjects with psoriasis of the body was evaluated at steady state following application of either calcipotriene foam or calcipotriene ointment to a body surface area of 5% to 10%. In the calcipotriene foam treatment group, 15 out of 16 subjects had calcipotriene plasma concentrations below the limit of quantitation (10 pg/mL), while in the calcipotriene ointment treated group, 5 out of 16 subjects had measurable calcipotriene plasma concentrations at various time points. All measurable plasma calcipotriene concentrations were below 25 pg/mL. The pharmacokinetics of calcipotriene foam, 0.005% was investigated when applied topically for 15 days to 17 subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years with moderate plaque psoriasis involving a mean BSA of 24%, excluding face and scalp, and a mean scalp involvement of 43%. Systemic concentration of calcipotriene were not quantifiable in any of the subjects (limit of quantification = 10 pg/mL). In 11 pediatric subjects 7 to 11 years of age with plaque psoriasis involving a mean BSA of 10%, plasma concentration of calcipotriene was measured following 2 weeks of twice daily administration of calcipotriene foam. No subject had quantifiable calcipotriene plasma concentration (limit of quantification = 10 pg/mL). The systemic disposition of calcipotriene is expected to be similar to that of the naturally occurring vitamin D. Absorbed calcipotriene is known to be converted to inactive metabolites within 24 hours of application and the metabolism occurs via a similar pathway to the natural hormone."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In two multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials a total of 659 subjects with psoriasis were randomized 2:1 to calcipotriene foam or vehicle; subjects applied the assigned treatment twice daily for 8 weeks. Baseline disease severity was graded using a 5-point Investigator Static Global Assessment scale (ISGA), on which subjects scored either \"mild\" or \"moderate\" as shown in Table 1. Table 1. Investigator Static Global Assessment (ISGA) Scale for Body Disease Severity Grade Definition Clear 0 No evidence of scaling, erythema, or plaque thickness Almost clear 1 Occasional fine scale, faint erythema, and barely perceptible plaque thickness Mild 2 Fine scale with light coloration and mild plaque elevation Moderate 3 Coarse scale with moderate red coloration and moderate plaque thickness Severe 4 Thick tenacious scale with deep coloration and severe plaque thickness Efficacy evaluation was carried out at Week 8 with treatment success being defined as a score of \"clear\" (grade 0) or \"almost clear\" (grade 1) and at least 2 grade improvement from the baseline score. Approximately 30% of enrolled subjects were graded as \"mild\" on the ISGA scale. The study population ranged in age from 12 to 89 years with 10 subjects less than 18 years of age at baseline. The subjects were 54% male and 88% Caucasian. Table 2 presents the efficacy results for each trial. Table 2.

Subjects applied the assigned treatment to the affected areas twice daily for 8 weeks. Baseline disease severity of the scalp was graded using a 6-point ISGA; a score of \"moderate\" corresponded to grade 3. The primary efficacy evaluation for scalp involvement was carried out at Week 8 with treatment success being defined as a score of \"clear\" (grade 0) or \"almost clear\" (grade 1). The study population ranged in age from 12 to 97 years with 11 subjects less than 18 years of age at baseline. The subjects were 60% male and 87% Caucasian.

      "DESCRIPTION Calcipotriene ointment, 0.005% contains the compound calcipotriene, a synthetic vitamin D 3 derivative for topical dermatological use. Chemically, calcipotriene is (5Z,7E,22E,24S)-24-cyclopropyl-9,10-secochola- 5,7,10(19),22-tetraene-1\u03b1,3\u03b2,24-triol-, with the empirical formula C 27 H 40 O 3 , a molecular weight of 412.6, and the following structural formula: Calcipotriene is a white or off-white crystalline substance. Calcipotriene ointment contains calcipotriene 50 \u03bcg/g in an ointment base of disodium phosphate dihydrate, edetate disodium, mineral oil, petrolatum, propylene glycol, \u03b1-tocopherol, steareth-2 and purified water.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In humans, the natural supply of vitamin D depends mainly on exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun for conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) in the skin. Calcipotriene is a synthetic analog of vitamin D 3 . Clinical studies with radiolabelled ointment indicate that approximately 6% (\u00b1 3%, SD) of the applied dose of calcipotriene is absorbed systemically when the ointment is applied topically to psoriasis plaques or 5% (\u00b1 2.6%, SD) when applied to normal skin, and much of the absorbed active is converted to inactive metabolites within 24 hours of application. Vitamin D and its metabolites are transported in the blood, bound to specific plasma proteins. The active form of the vitamin, 1,25-dihyroxy vitamin D 3 (calcitriol), is known to be recycled via the liver and excreted in the bile. Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid, and occurs via a similar pathway to the natural hormone. The primary metabolites are much less potent than the parent compound. There is evidence that maternal 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (calcitriol) may enter the fetal circulation, but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. The systemic disposition of calcipotriene is expected to be similar to that of the naturally occurring vitamin."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "CLINICAL STUDIES Adequate and well-controlled trials of patients treated with calcipotriene ointment have demonstrated improvement usually beginning after two weeks of therapy. This improvement continued in patients using calcipotriene once daily and twice daily. After 8 weeks of once daily calcipotriene, 56.7% of patients showed at least marked improvements (6.4% showed complete clearing). After 8 weeks of twice daily calcipotriene, 70.0% of patients showed at least marked improvement (11.3% showed complete clearing). Subtracting percentages of patients using placebo (vehicle only) from percentages of patients using calcipotriene who had at least marked improvements after 8 weeks yields 39.9% for once daily and 49.6% for twice daily. This adjustment for placebo effect indicated that what might appear to be differences between once and twice daily use may reflect differences in the studies independent from the frequency of dosing. Although there was a numerical difference in comparison across studies, twice daily dosing has not been shown to be superior in efficacy to once daily dosing. Over 400 patients have been treated in open label clinical studies of calcipotriene for periods of up to one year. In half of these studies, patients who previously had not responded well to calcipotriene were excluded. The adverse events in these extended studies included skin irritation in approximately 25% of patients and worsening of psoriasis in approximately 10% of patients. In one of these open label studies, half of the patients no longer required calcipotriene by 16 weeks of treatment, because of satisfactory therapeutic results."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Calcipotriene is contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the preparation.

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Use of calcipotriene may cause irritation of lesions and surrounding uninvolved skin. If irritation develops, calcipotriene should be discontinued. For external use only. Keep out of the reach of children. Always wash hands thoroughly after use. Transient, rapidly reversible elevation of serum calcium has occurred with use of calcipotriene. If elevation in serum calcium outside the normal range should occur, discontinue treatment until normal calcium levels are restored. Information for Patients Patients using calcipotriene should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the face or eyes. As with any topical medication, patients should wash hands after application. 2. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. 3. Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse reactions. 4. Patients that apply calcipotriene to exposed portions of the body should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight (including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc.) Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility When calcipotriene was applied topically to mice for up to 24 months at dosages of 3, 10 and 30 \u03bcg/kg/day (corresponding to 9, 30 and 90 \u03bcg/m2/day), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. In a study in which albino hairless mice were exposed to both UVR and topically applied calcipotriene, a reduction in the time required for UVR to indicate the formation of skin tumors was observed (statistically significant in males only), suggesting that calcipotriene may enhance the effect of UVR to induce skin tumors. Patients that apply calcipotriene to exposed portions of the body should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight (including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc.). Physicians may wish to limit or avoid use of phototherapy in patients that use calcipotriene. Calcipotriene did not elicit any mutagenic effects in an Ames mutagenicity assay, a mouse lymphoma TK locus assay, a human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay, or in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Studies in rats at doses up to 54 \u03bcg/kg/day (324 \u03bcg/m2/day) of calcipotriene indicated no impairment of fertility or general reproductive performance. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C Studies of teratogenicity were done by the oral route where bioavailability is expected to be approximately 40-60% of the administered dose. In rabbits, increased maternal and fetal toxicity were noted at a dosage of 12 \u03bcg/kg/day (132 \u03bcg/m2/day); a dosage of 36 \u03bcg/kg/day (396 \u03bcg/m2/day) resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of incomplete ossification of the pubic bones and forelimb phalanges of fetuses. In a rat study, a dosage of 54 \u03bcg/kg/day (318 \u03bcg/m2/day) resulted in a significantly increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities (enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs). The enlarged fontanelles are most likely due to calcipotriene's effect upon calcium metabolism. The estimated maternal and fetal no-effect exposure levels in the rat (43.2 \u03bcg/m2/day) and rabbit (17.6 \u03bcg/m2/day) studies are approximately equal to the expected human systemic exposure level (18.5 \u03bcg/m2/day) from dermal application. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, calcipotriene ointment should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether calcipotriene is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when calcipotriene ointment, 0.005% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of calcipotriene in pediatric patients have not been established. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at greater risk than adults of systemic adverse effects when they are treated with topical medication. Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of calcipotriene ointment, approximately 12% were 65 or older, while approximately 4% were 75 and over. The results of an analysis of severity of skin-related adverse events showed a statistically significant difference for subjects over 65 years (more severe) compared to those under 65 years (less severe)."

Studies in rats at doses up to 54 \u03bcg/kg/day (324 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) of calcipotriene indicated no impairment of fertility or general reproductive performance. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Studies of teratogenicity were done by the oral route where bioavailability is expected to be approximately 40-60% of the administered dose. Increased rabbit maternal and fetal toxicity was noted at 12 \u03bcg/kg/day (132 \u03bcg/m 2 /day). Rabbits administered 36 \u03bcg/kg/day (396 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) resulted in fetuses with a significant increase in the incidences of pubic bones, forelimb phalanges, and incomplete bone ossification. In a rat study, oral doses of 54 \u03bcg/kg/day (318 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) resulted in a significantly higher incidence of skeletal abnormalities consisting primarily of enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. The enlarged fontanelles are most likely due to calcipotriene's effect upon calcium metabolism. The maternal and fetal calculated no-effect exposures in the rat (43.2 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) and rabbit (17.6 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) studies are approximately equal to the expected human systemic exposure level (18.5 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) from dermal application. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Calcipotriene Cream should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers There is evidence that maternal 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (calcitriol) may enter the fetal circulation, but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. The systemic disposition of calcipotriene is expected to be similar to that of the naturally occurring vitamin. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Calcipotriene Cream is administered to a nursing woman.

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility When calcipotriene was applied topically to mice for up to 24 months at dosages of 3, 10 and 30 \u00b5g/kg/day (corresponding to 9, 30 and 90 \u00b5g/m 2 /day), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. In a study in which albino hairless mice were exposed to both UVR and topically applied calcipotriene, a reduction in the time required for UVR to induce the formation of skin tumors was observed (statistically significant in males only), suggesting that calcipotriene may enhance the effect of UVR to induce skin tumors. Patients that apply Calcipotriene Cream to exposed portions of the body should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight (including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc.). Physicians may wish to limit or avoid use of phototherapy in patients that use Calcipotriene Cream.

      "Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Studies of teratogenicity were done by the oral route where bioavailability is expected to be approximately 40-60% of the administered dose. Increased rabbit maternal and fetal toxicity was noted at 12 \u03bcg/kg/day (132 \u03bcg/m 2 /day). Rabbits administered 36 \u03bcg/kg/day (396 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) resulted in fetuses with a significant increase in the incidences of pubic bones, forelimb phalanges, and incomplete bone ossification. In a rat study, oral doses of 54 \u03bcg/kg/day (318 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) resulted in a significantly higher incidence of skeletal abnormalities consisting primarily of enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. The enlarged fontanelles are most likely due to calcipotriene's effect upon calcium metabolism. The maternal and fetal calculated no-effect exposures in the rat (43.2 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) and rabbit (17.6 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) studies are approximately equal to the expected human systemic exposure level (18.5 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) from dermal application.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In humans, the natural supply of vitamin D depends mainly on exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun for conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) in the skin. Calcipotriene is a synthetic analog of vitamin D 3 . Clinical studies with radiolabelled calcipotriene ointment indicate that approximately 6% (\u00b1 3%, SD) of the applied dose of calcipotriene is absorbed systemically when the ointment is applied topically to psoriasis plaques, or 5% (\u00b1 2.6%, SD) when applied to normal skin, and much of the absorbed active is converted to inactive metabolites within 24 hours of application. Systemic absorption of the cream has not been studied. Vitamin D and its metabolites are transported in the blood, bound to specific plasma proteins. The active form of the vitamin, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (calcitriol), is known to be recycled via the liver and excreted in the bile. Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid, and occurs via a similar pathway to the natural hormone."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In humans, the natural supply of vitamin D depends mainly on exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun for conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) in the skin. Calcipotriene is a synthetic analog of vitamin D 3 . Clinical studies with radiolabelled calcipotriene ointment indicate that approximately 6% (\u00b1 3%, SD) of the applied dose of calcipotriene is absorbed systemically when the ointment is applied topically to psoriasis plaques, or 5% (\u00b1 2.6%, SD) when applied to normal skin, and much of the absorbed active is converted to inactive metabolites within 24 hours of application. Systemic absorption of the cream has not been studied. Vitamin D and its metabolites are transported in the blood, bound to specific plasma proteins. The active form of the vitamin, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (calcitriol), is known to be recycled via the liver and excreted in the bile. Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid, and occurs via a similar pathway to the natural hormone."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "CLINICAL STUDIES Adequate and well-controlled trials of patients treated with calcipotriene cream have demonstrated improvement usually beginning after 2 weeks of therapy. This improvement continued with approximately 50% of patients showing at least marked improvement in the signs and symptoms of psoriasis after 8 weeks of therapy, but only approximately 4% showed complete clearing."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Use of calcipotriene cream may cause transient irritation of both lesions and surrounding uninvolved skin. If irritation develops, calcipotriene cream should be discontinued. For external use only. Keep out of the reach of children. Always wash hands thoroughly after use. Reversible elevation of serum calcium has occurred with use of topical calcipotriene. If elevation in serum calcium outside the normal range should occur, discontinue treatment until normal calcium levels are restored. Information for Patients Patients using calcipotriene cream should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used only as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the face or eyes. As with any topical medication, patients should wash their hands after application. 2. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. 3. Patients should report to their physician any signs of adverse reactions. 4. Patients that apply calcipotriene cream to exposed portions of the body should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight (including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc.). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility When calcipotriene was applied topically to mice for up to 24 months at dosages of 3, 10 and 30 mcg/kg/day (corresponding to 9, 30 and 90 mcg/m 2 /day), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. In a study in which albino hairless mice were exposed to both UVR and topically applied calcipotriene, a reduction in the time required for UVR to induce the formation of skin tumors was observed (statistically significant in males only), suggesting that calcipotriene may enhance the effect of UVR to induce skin tumors. Patients that apply calcipotriene cream to exposed portions of the body should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight (including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc.). Physicians may wish to limit or avoid use of phototherapy in patients that use calcipotriene cream. Calcipotriene did not elicit any mutagenic effects in an Ames mutagenicity assay, a mouse lymphoma TK locus assay, a human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay, or in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Studies in rats at doses up to 54 mcg/kg/day (324 mcg/m 2 /day) of calcipotriene indicated no impairment of fertility or general reproductive performance. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Studies of teratogenicity were done by the oral route where bioavailability is expected to be approximately 40 to 60% of the administered dose. Increased rabbit maternal and fetal toxicity was noted at 12 mcg/kg/day (132 mcg/m 2 /day). Rabbits administered 36 mcg/kg/day (396 mcg/m 2 /day) resulted in fetuses with a significant increase in the incidences of pubic bones, forelimb phalanges, and incomplete bone ossification. In a rat study, oral doses of 54 mcg/kg/day (318 mcg/m 2 /day) resulted in a significantly higher incidence of skeletal abnormalities consisting primarily of enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. The enlarged fontanelles are most likely due to calcipotriene's effect upon calcium metabolism. The maternal and fetal calculated no-effect exposures in the rat (43.2 mcg/m 2 /day) and rabbit (17.6 mcg/m 2 /day) studies are approximately equal to the expected human systemic exposure level (18.5 mcg/m 2 /day) from dermal application. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, calcipotriene cream should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers There is evidence that maternal 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (calcitriol) may enter the fetal circulation, but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. The systemic disposition of calcipotriene is expected to be similar to that of the naturally occurring vitamin. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when calcipotriene cream is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of calcipotriene cream in pediatric patients have not been established. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at greater risk than adults of systemic adverse effects when they are treated with topical medication. Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of calcipotriene cream, approximately 15% were 65 or older, while approximately 3% were 75 and over. There were no significant differences in adverse events for subjects over 65 years compared to those under 65 years of age. However, the greater sensitivity of older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed. If either occurs, discontinue treatment until parameters of calcium metabolism normalize. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency during and after withdrawal of treatment. Risk factors include the use of high-potency topical corticosteroid, use over a large surface area or to areas under occlusion, prolonged use, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and use in pediatric patients. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.2 , 8.4 ) \u2022 Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment may increase the risk of cataract and glaucoma. If visual symptoms occur, consider referral to an ophthalmologist. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hypercalcemia and Hypercalciuria Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed with use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. If hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria develops, treatment should be discontinued until parameters of calcium metabolism have normalized. In the trials that included assessment of the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on calcium metabolism, such testing was done after 4 weeks of treatment. The effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on calcium metabolism following treatment durations of longer than 4 weeks have not been evaluated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . 5.2 Effects on Endocrine System Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency corticosteroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the cosyntropin stimulation test [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a trial evaluating the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension and calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the HPA axis, 32 adult subjects were treated with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp and calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression was identified in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . The effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the HPA axis following treatment durations of longer than 4 weeks have not been adequately studied. If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid. Cushing's syndrome and hyperglycemia may also occur due to the systemic effects of topical corticosteroids. These complications are rare and generally occur after prolonged exposure to excessively large doses, especially of high-potency topical corticosteroids. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their higher skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. 5.3 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids, including Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment, may increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Glaucoma and cataracts have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products, including topical clobetasol products. Avoid contact of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.5 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Calcipotriene Allergic contact dermatitis has been observed with use of topical calcipotriene. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.6 Skin Irritation If irritation develops, treatment with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.7 Risk of Ultraviolet Light Exposure Patients who apply Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment to exposed skin should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight, including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc. Physicians may wish to limit or avoid use of phototherapy in patients who use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment."

Other less common reactions (less than 1% but more than 0.1%) were, in decreasing order of incidence, folliculitis, rash papular, rash pustular, and skin hypopigmentation. Skin atrophy, telangiectasia and skin hyperpigmentation were reported infrequently (0.1%). In a separate trial, subjects (N = 207) with at least moderate disease severity were given calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment intermittently on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis for up to 52 weeks. The median use was 15.4 g per week. The effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on calcium metabolism were not studied and the effects on the HPA axis were not adequately studied. The following adverse reactions were reported by 1% or more of the subjects: pruritus (7.2%), psoriasis (3.4%), skin atrophy (1.9%), folliculitis (1.4%), burning sensation (1.4%), skin depigmentation (1.4%), ecchymosis (1.0%), erythema (1.0%) and hand dermatitis (1.0%). One case of serious flare-up of psoriasis was reported. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions associated with the use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment have been identified post-approval: pustular psoriasis and rebound effect. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Postmarketing reports for local adverse reactions to topical corticosteroids may also include: striae, dryness, acneiform eruptions, perioral dermatitis, secondary infection and miliaria."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment contains calcipotriene and bethamethasone dipropionate. The limited data with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment and calcipotriene use in pregnant women are not sufficient to evaluate a Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment-associated or calcipotriene-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Observational studies suggest an increased risk of having low birthweight infants with the maternal use of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women that Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment may increase the potential risk of having a low birth weight infant and to use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs ( see Data ). Oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis had no apparent effects on embryo-fetal development. Subcutaneous administration of betamethasone dipropionate to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, and fetal malformations (cleft palate and crooked or short tail) ( see Data ). The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposures of calcipotriene and betamethasone diproprionate observed in animal studies to the systemic exposures that would be expected in humans after topical use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Available observational studies in pregnant women did not identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, preterm delivery, or fetal mortality with the use of topical corticosteroids of any potency. However, when the dispensed amount of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids exceeded 300 g during the entire pregnancy, maternal use was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight in infants. Animal Data Embryo-fetal development studies with calcipotriene were performed by the oral route in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats received dosages of 0, 6, 18, or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-15 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). There were no apparent effects on maternal survival, behavior, or body weight gain, no effects on litter parameters, and no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses. Fetuses from dams dosed at 54 mcg/kg/day exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. Pregnant rabbits were dosed daily with calcipotriene at exposures of 0, 4, 12, or 36 mcg/kg/day (0, 48, 144, and 432 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Mean maternal body weight gain was reduced in animals dosed at 12 or 36 mcg/kg/day. The incidence of fetal deaths was increased in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day; reduced fetal weight was also observed in this group. The incidence of major malformations among fetuses was not affected. An increase in the incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including incomplete ossification of sternebrae, pubic bones, and forelimb phalanges, was observed in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day. Embryo-fetal development studies with betamethasone dipropionate were performed via subcutaneous injection in mice and rabbits. Pregnant mice were administered doses of 0, 156, 625, or 2500 mcg/kg/day (0, 468, 1875, and 7500 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 7 through 13 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, malformations (increased incidence of the cleft palate and crooked or short tail), and minor skeletal abnormalities (delayed ossification of vertebra and sternebrae). Fetal toxicity was observed at the lowest exposure that was evaluated (156 mcg/kg/day). Pregnant rabbits were injected subcutaneously at dosages of 0, 0.625, 2.5, and 10 mcg/kg/day (0, 7.5, 30, and 120 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6 through 18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, external malformations (including malformed ears, cleft palate, umbilical hernia, kinked tail, club foot, and club hand), and skeletal malformations (including absence of phalanges of the first digit and cranial dysplasia) at dosages of 2.5 mcg/kg/day and above. Calcipotriene was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 6, 18 or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 15 through day 20 postpartum. No remarkable effects were observed on any parameter, including survival, behavior, body weight, litter parameters, or the ability to nurse or rear pups. Betamethasone dipropionate was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day (0, 600, 1800, and 6000 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 6 through day 20 postpartum. Mean maternal body weight was significantly reduced on gestation day 20 in animals dosed at 300 and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean duration of gestation was slightly, but statistically significantly, increased at 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean percentage of pups that survived to day 4 was reduced in relation to dosage. On lactation day 5, the percentage of pups with a reflex to right themselves when placed on their back was significantly reduced at 1000 mcg/ kg/day. No effects on the ability of pups to learn were observed, and the ability of the offspring of treated rats to reproduce was not affected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topically administered calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. It is not known whether topically administered calcipotriene or corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of the use of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment in pediatric patients under the age of 12 years have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment for the treatment of plaque psoriasis have been established in the age group 12 to 17 years. In a prospective, uncontrolled trial, 33 pediatric subjects ages 12-17 years with plaque psoriasis on the body were treated with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment for 4 weeks up to a maximum of 55.8 g per week. Subjects were assessed for HPA axis suppression and effects on calcium metabolism. No adverse effects on adrenal suppression were observed. No hypercalcemia was observed but one subject had a possible treatment-related increase in urinary calcium [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical drugs. They are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency upon the use of topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Rare systemic toxicities such as Cushing\u2019s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids. Local adverse reactions including striae have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in the clinical studies of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment, approximately 14% were 65 years and older and approximately 3% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. All other reported clinical experience has not identified any differences in response between elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment contains calcipotriene and bethamethasone dipropionate. The limited data with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment and calcipotriene use in pregnant women are not sufficient to evaluate a Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment-associated or calcipotriene-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Observational studies suggest an increased risk of having low birthweight infants with the maternal use of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women that Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment may increase the potential risk of having a low birth weight infant and to use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs ( see Data ). Oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis had no apparent effects on embryo-fetal development. Subcutaneous administration of betamethasone dipropionate to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, and fetal malformations (cleft palate and crooked or short tail) ( see Data ). The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposures of calcipotriene and betamethasone diproprionate observed in animal studies to the systemic exposures that would be expected in humans after topical use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Available observational studies in pregnant women did not identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, preterm delivery, or fetal mortality with the use of topical corticosteroids of any potency. However, when the dispensed amount of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids exceeded 300 g during the entire pregnancy, maternal use was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight in infants. Animal Data Embryo-fetal development studies with calcipotriene were performed by the oral route in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats received dosages of 0, 6, 18, or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-15 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). There were no apparent effects on maternal survival, behavior, or body weight gain, no effects on litter parameters, and no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses. Fetuses from dams dosed at 54 mcg/kg/day exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. Pregnant rabbits were dosed daily with calcipotriene at exposures of 0, 4, 12, or 36 mcg/kg/day (0, 48, 144, and 432 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Mean maternal body weight gain was reduced in animals dosed at 12 or 36 mcg/kg/day. The incidence of fetal deaths was increased in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day; reduced fetal weight was also observed in this group. The incidence of major malformations among fetuses was not affected. An increase in the incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including incomplete ossification of sternebrae, pubic bones, and forelimb phalanges, was observed in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day. Embryo-fetal development studies with betamethasone dipropionate were performed via subcutaneous injection in mice and rabbits. Pregnant mice were administered doses of 0, 156, 625, or 2500 mcg/kg/day (0, 468, 1875, and 7500 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 7 through 13 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, malformations (increased incidence of the cleft palate and crooked or short tail), and minor skeletal abnormalities (delayed ossification of vertebra and sternebrae). Fetal toxicity was observed at the lowest exposure that was evaluated (156 mcg/kg/day). Pregnant rabbits were injected subcutaneously at dosages of 0, 0.625, 2.5, and 10 mcg/kg/day (0, 7.5, 30, and 120 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6 through 18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, external malformations (including malformed ears, cleft palate, umbilical hernia, kinked tail, club foot, and club hand), and skeletal malformations (including absence of phalanges of the first digit and cranial dysplasia) at dosages of 2.5 mcg/kg/day and above. Calcipotriene was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 6, 18 or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 15 through day 20 postpartum. No remarkable effects were observed on any parameter, including survival, behavior, body weight, litter parameters, or the ability to nurse or rear pups. Betamethasone dipropionate was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day (0, 600, 1800, and 6000 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 6 through day 20 postpartum. Mean maternal body weight was significantly reduced on gestation day 20 in animals dosed at 300 and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean duration of gestation was slightly, but statistically significantly, increased at 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean percentage of pups that survived to day 4 was reduced in relation to dosage. On lactation day 5, the percentage of pups with a reflex to right themselves when placed on their back was significantly reduced at 1000 mcg/ kg/day. No effects on the ability of pups to learn were observed, and the ability of the offspring of treated rats to reproduce was not affected."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of the use of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment in pediatric patients under the age of 12 years have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment for the treatment of plaque psoriasis have been established in the age group 12 to 17 years. In a prospective, uncontrolled trial, 33 pediatric subjects ages 12-17 years with plaque psoriasis on the body were treated with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment for 4 weeks up to a maximum of 55.8 g per week. Subjects were assessed for HPA axis suppression and effects on calcium metabolism. No adverse effects on adrenal suppression were observed. No hypercalcemia was observed but one subject had a possible treatment-related increase in urinary calcium [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical drugs. They are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency upon the use of topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Rare systemic toxicities such as Cushing\u2019s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids. Local adverse reactions including striae have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment combines the pharmacological effects of calcipotriene as a synthetic vitamin D 3 analogue and betamethasone dipropionate as a synthetic corticosteroid. However, while their pharmacologic and clinical effects are known, the exact mechanisms of their actions in plaque psoriasis are unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Vasoconstriction: In a vasoconstrictor trial in healthy subjects, the skin blanching response of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was consistent with that of a potent corticosteroid when compared with other topical corticosteroids. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression: HPA axis suppression was evaluated in four trials (Trial A, B, C and D) following the application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. In Trial A, calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was applied once daily for 4 weeks to adult subjects (N = 12) with plaque psoriasis to study its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Of eleven subjects tested, none demonstrated adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level \u2264 18 mcg/dL. In Trial B, calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was evaluated in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis (N = 19). One subject demonstrated adrenal suppression. In Trial C, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=32) with extensive plaque psoriasis involving at least 30% of the scalp and, in total, 15-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minutes post-stimulation cortisol level < 18 mcg/dL was observed in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment as per the recommended duration of use [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . In Trial D, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in subjects 12 to 17 years (N=32) with plaque psoriasis of the body involving 5-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment to the affected areas for up to 4 weeks. Mean weekly dose was 29.6 g with a range of 8.1-55.8 g/week. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level \u226418 mcg/dL was observed in none of 32 evaluable subjects after 4 weeks of treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Effects on Calcium Metabolism In Trial C described above, the effects of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp on calcium metabolism were also examined. Elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in 1 of 35 subjects (2.9%) after 4 weeks of treatment. In Trial D described above, calcium metabolism was evaluated in a total of 33 subjects aged 12 to 17 years with plaque psoriasis involving 5-30% of the body surface area who underwent once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment for up to 4 weeks. No cases of hypercalcemia and no clinically relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported. However, one subject had a normal urinary calcium: creatinine ratio at baseline (3.75 mmol/g), which increased above the normal range at week 4 (16 mmol/g). There were no relevant changes in albumin-corrected serum calcium or other markers of calcium metabolism for this subject. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In Trial C described above, the systemic effect of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment in extensive plaque psoriasis was investigated. In this trial, the serum levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 weeks (maximum recommended duration of treatment) and also after 8 weeks of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp. Both calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate were below the lower limit of quantification in all serum samples of the 34 subjects evaluated. However, one major metabolite of calcipotriene (MC1080) was quantifiable in 10 of 34 (29.4%) subjects at week 4 and in five of 12 (41.7%) subjects at week 8. The major metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) was also quantifiable in 19 of 34 (55.9%) subjects at week 4 and seven of 12 (58.3%) subjects at week 8. The serum concentrations for MC1080 ranged from 20-75 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Metabolism Calcipotriene: Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid and occurs in the liver. The primary metabolites of calcipotriene are less potent than the parent compound. Calcipotriene is metabolized to MC1046 (the alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone analogue of calcipotriene), which is metabolized further to MC1080 (a saturated ketone analogue). MC1080 is the major metabolite in plasma. MC1080 is slowly metabolized to calcitroic acid. Betamethasone dipropionate: Betamethasone dipropionate is metabolized to betamethasone 17-propionate and betamethasone, including the 6beta-hydroxy derivatives of those compounds by hydrolysis. Betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) is the primary metabolite."

Subjects were randomized to one of four treatment arms: calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment, calcipotriene hydrate 50 mcg/g in the same vehicle, betamethasone dipropionate 0.64 mg/g in the same vehicle, and vehicle alone. The mean age of the subjects was 48.4 years and 60.5% were male. Most subjects had disease of moderate severity at baseline. Efficacy was assessed as the proportion of subjects with absent or very mild disease according to the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment of Disease Severity at end of treatment (4 weeks). \u201cAbsent\u201d disease was defined as no evidence of redness, thickness, or scaling. \u201cVery mild disease\u201d was defined as controlled disease, but not entirely cleared: lesions with some discoloration with absolutely minimal thickness, i.e. the edges to the lesion(s) could just be felt.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed. If either occurs, discontinue treatment until parameters of calcium metabolism normalize. (5.1) \u2022 Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency during and after withdrawal of treatment. Risk factors include the use of high-potency topical corticosteroid, use over a large surface area or to areas under occlusion, prolonged use, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and use in pediatric patients. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. (5.2, 8.4) \u2022 Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment may increase the risk of cataract and glaucoma. If visual symptoms occur, consider referral to an ophthalmologist. (5.3) 5.1 Hypercalcemia and Hypercalciuria Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed with use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. If hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria develops, treatment should be discontinued until parameters of calcium metabolism have normalized. In the trials that included assessment of the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on calcium metabolism, such testing was done after 4 weeks of treatment. The effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on calcium metabolism following treatment durations of longer than 4 weeks have not been evaluated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . 5.2 Effects on Endocrine System Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency corticosteroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the cosyntropin stimulation test [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a trial evaluating the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension and calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the HPA axis, 32 adult subjects were treated with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp and calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression was identified in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . The effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the HPA axis following treatment durations of longer than 4 weeks have not been adequately studied. If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid. Cushing's syndrome and hyperglycemia may also occur due to the systemic effects of topical corticosteroids. These complications are rare and generally occur after prolonged exposure to excessively large doses, especially of high-potency topical corticosteroids. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their higher skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. 5.3 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids, including Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment, may increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Glaucoma and cataracts have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products, including topical clobetasol products. Avoid contact of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.5 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Calcipotriene Allergic contact dermatitis has been observed with use of topical calcipotriene. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.6 Skin Irritation If irritation develops, treatment with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.7 Risk of Ultraviolet Light Exposure Patients who apply Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment to exposed skin should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight, including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc. Physicians may wish to limit or avoid use of phototherapy in patients who use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment."

Other less common reactions (less than 1% but more than 0.1%) were, in decreasing order of incidence, folliculitis, rash papular, rash pustular, and skin hypopigmentation. Skin atrophy, telangiectasia and skin hyperpigmentation were reported infrequently (0.1%). In a separate trial, subjects (N = 207) with at least moderate disease severity were given calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment intermittently on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis for up to 52 weeks. The median use was 15.4 g per week. The effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on calcium metabolism were not studied and the effects on the HPA axis were not adequately studied. The following adverse reactions were reported by 1% or more of the subjects: pruritus (7.2%), psoriasis (3.4%), skin atrophy (1.9%), folliculitis (1.4%), burning sensation (1.4%), skin depigmentation (1.4%), ecchymosis (1.0%), erythema (1.0%) and hand dermatitis (1.0%). One case of serious flare-up of psoriasis was reported. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions associated with the use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment have been identified post-approval: pustular psoriasis and rebound effect. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Postmarketing reports for local adverse reactions to topical corticosteroids may also include: striae, dryness, acneiform eruptions, perioral dermatitis, secondary infection and miliaria."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment contains calcipotriene and bethamethasone dipropionate. The limited data with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment and calcipotriene use in pregnant women are not sufficient to evaluate a Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment-associated or calcipotriene-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Observational studies suggest an increased risk of having low birthweight infants with the maternal use of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women that Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment may increase the potential risk of having a low birth weight infant and to use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs ( see Data ). Oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis had no apparent effects on embryo-fetal development. Subcutaneous administration of betamethasone dipropionate to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, and fetal malformations (cleft palate and crooked or short tail) ( see Data ). The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposures of calcipotriene and betamethasone diproprionate observed in animal studies to the systemic exposures that would be expected in humans after topical use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Available observational studies in pregnant women did not identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, preterm delivery, or fetal mortality with the use of topical corticosteroids of any potency. However, when the dispensed amount of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids exceeded 300 g during the entire pregnancy, maternal use was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight in infants. Animal Data Embryo-fetal development studies with calcipotriene were performed by the oral route in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats received dosages of 0, 6, 18, or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-15 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). There were no apparent effects on maternal survival, behavior, or body weight gain, no effects on litter parameters, and no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses. Fetuses from dams dosed at 54 mcg/kg/day exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. Pregnant rabbits were dosed daily with calcipotriene at exposures of 0, 4, 12, or 36 mcg/kg/day (0, 48, 144, and 432 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Mean maternal body weight gain was reduced in animals dosed at 12 or 36 mcg/kg/day. The incidence of fetal deaths was increased in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day; reduced fetal weight was also observed in this group. The incidence of major malformations among fetuses was not affected. An increase in the incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including incomplete ossification of sternebrae, pubic bones, and forelimb phalanges, was observed in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day. Embryo-fetal development studies with betamethasone dipropionate were performed via subcutaneous injection in mice and rabbits. Pregnant mice were administered doses of 0, 156, 625, or 2500 mcg/kg/day (0, 468, 1875, and 7500 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 7 through 13 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, malformations (increased incidence of the cleft palate and crooked or short tail), and minor skeletal abnormalities (delayed ossification of vertebra and sternebrae). Fetal toxicity was observed at the lowest exposure that was evaluated (156 mcg/kg/day). Pregnant rabbits were injected subcutaneously at dosages of 0, 0.625, 2.5, and 10 mcg/kg/day (0, 7.5, 30, and 120 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6 through 18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, external malformations (including malformed ears, cleft palate, umbilical hernia, kinked tail, club foot, and club hand), and skeletal malformations (including absence of phalanges of the first digit and cranial dysplasia) at dosages of 2.5 mcg/kg/day and above. Calcipotriene was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 6, 18 or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 15 through day 20 postpartum. No remarkable effects were observed on any parameter, including survival, behavior, body weight, litter parameters, or the ability to nurse or rear pups. Betamethasone dipropionate was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day (0, 600, 1800, and 6000 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 6 through day 20 postpartum. Mean maternal body weight was significantly reduced on gestation day 20 in animals dosed at 300 and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean duration of gestation was slightly, but statistically significantly, increased at 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean percentage of pups that survived to day 4 was reduced in relation to dosage. On lactation day 5, the percentage of pups with a reflex to right themselves when placed on their back was significantly reduced at 1000 mcg/ kg/day. No effects on the ability of pups to learn were observed, and the ability of the offspring of treated rats to reproduce was not affected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topically administered calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. It is not known whether topically administered calcipotriene or corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of the use of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment in pediatric patients under the age of 12 years have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment for the treatment of plaque psoriasis have been established in the age group 12 to 17 years. In a prospective, uncontrolled trial, 33 pediatric subjects ages 12-17 years with plaque psoriasis on the body were treated with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment for 4 weeks up to a maximum of 55.8 g per week. Subjects were assessed for HPA axis suppression and effects on calcium metabolism. No adverse effects on adrenal suppression were observed. No hypercalcemia was observed but one subject had a possible treatment-related increase in urinary calcium [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical drugs. They are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency upon the use of topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Rare systemic toxicities such as Cushing\u2019s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids. Local adverse reactions including striae have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in the clinical studies of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment, approximately 14% were 65 years and older and approximately 3% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. All other reported clinical experience has not identified any differences in response between elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

The limited data with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment and calcipotriene use in pregnant women are not sufficient to evaluate a Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment-associated or calcipotriene-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Observational studies suggest an increased risk of having low birthweight infants with the maternal use of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women that Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment may increase the potential risk of having a low birth weight infant and to use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs ( see Data ). Oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis had no apparent effects on embryo-fetal development. Subcutaneous administration of betamethasone dipropionate to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, and fetal malformations (cleft palate and crooked or short tail) ( see Data ). The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposures of calcipotriene and betamethasone diproprionate observed in animal studies to the systemic exposures that would be expected in humans after topical use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Available observational studies in pregnant women did not identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, preterm delivery, or fetal mortality with the use of topical corticosteroids of any potency. However, when the dispensed amount of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids exceeded 300 g during the entire pregnancy, maternal use was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight in infants. Animal Data Embryo-fetal development studies with calcipotriene were performed by the oral route in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats received dosages of 0, 6, 18, or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-15 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). There were no apparent effects on maternal survival, behavior, or body weight gain, no effects on litter parameters, and no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses. Fetuses from dams dosed at 54 mcg/kg/day exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. Pregnant rabbits were dosed daily with calcipotriene at exposures of 0, 4, 12, or 36 mcg/kg/day (0, 48, 144, and 432 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Mean maternal body weight gain was reduced in animals dosed at 12 or 36 mcg/kg/day. The incidence of fetal deaths was increased in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day; reduced fetal weight was also observed in this group. The incidence of major malformations among fetuses was not affected. An increase in the incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including incomplete ossification of sternebrae, pubic bones, and forelimb phalanges, was observed in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day. Embryo-fetal development studies with betamethasone dipropionate were performed via subcutaneous injection in mice and rabbits. Pregnant mice were administered doses of 0, 156, 625, or 2500 mcg/kg/day (0, 468, 1875, and 7500 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 7 through 13 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, malformations (increased incidence of the cleft palate and crooked or short tail), and minor skeletal abnormalities (delayed ossification of vertebra and sternebrae). Fetal toxicity was observed at the lowest exposure that was evaluated (156 mcg/kg/day). Pregnant rabbits were injected subcutaneously at dosages of 0, 0.625, 2.5, and 10 mcg/kg/day (0, 7.5, 30, and 120 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6 through 18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, external malformations (including malformed ears, cleft palate, umbilical hernia, kinked tail, club foot, and club hand), and skeletal malformations (including absence of phalanges of the first digit and cranial dysplasia) at dosages of 2.5 mcg/kg/day and above. Calcipotriene was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 6, 18 or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 15 through day 20 postpartum. No remarkable effects were observed on any parameter, including survival, behavior, body weight, litter parameters, or the ability to nurse or rear pups. Betamethasone dipropionate was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day (0, 600, 1800, and 6000 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 6 through day 20 postpartum. Mean maternal body weight was significantly reduced on gestation day 20 in animals dosed at 300 and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean duration of gestation was slightly, but statistically significantly, increased at 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean percentage of pups that survived to day 4 was reduced in relation to dosage. On lactation day 5, the percentage of pups with a reflex to right themselves when placed on their back was significantly reduced at 1000 mcg/ kg/day. No effects on the ability of pups to learn were observed, and the ability of the offspring of treated rats to reproduce was not affected."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of the use of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment in pediatric patients under the age of 12 years have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment for the treatment of plaque psoriasis have been established in the age group 12 to 17 years. In a prospective, uncontrolled trial, 33 pediatric subjects ages 12-17 years with plaque psoriasis on the body were treated with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment for 4 weeks up to a maximum of 55.8 g per week. Subjects were assessed for HPA axis suppression and effects on calcium metabolism. No adverse effects on adrenal suppression were observed. No hypercalcemia was observed but one subject had a possible treatment-related increase in urinary calcium [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical drugs. They are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency upon the use of topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Rare systemic toxicities such as Cushing\u2019s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids. Local adverse reactions including striae have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment combines the pharmacological effects of calcipotriene as a synthetic vitamin D 3 analogue and betamethasone dipropionate as a synthetic corticosteroid. However, while their pharmacologic and clinical effects are known, the exact mechanisms of their actions in plaque psoriasis are unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Vasoconstriction: In a vasoconstrictor trial in healthy subjects, the skin blanching response of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was consistent with that of a potent corticosteroid when compared with other topical corticosteroids. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression: HPA axis suppression was evaluated in four trials (Trial A, B, C and D) following the application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. In Trial A, calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was applied once daily for 4 weeks to adult subjects (N = 12) with plaque psoriasis to study its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Of eleven subjects tested, none demonstrated adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level \u2264 18 mcg/dL. In Trial B, calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was evaluated in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis (N = 19). One subject demonstrated adrenal suppression. In Trial C, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=32) with extensive plaque psoriasis involving at least 30% of the scalp and, in total, 15-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minutes post-stimulation cortisol level < 18 mcg/dL was observed in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment as per the recommended duration of use [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . In Trial D, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in subjects 12 to 17 years (N=32) with plaque psoriasis of the body involving 5-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment to the affected areas for up to 4 weeks. Mean weekly dose was 29.6 g with a range of 8.1-55.8 g/week. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level \u226418 mcg/dL was observed in none of 32 evaluable subjects after 4 weeks of treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Effects on Calcium Metabolism In Trial C described above, the effects of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp on calcium metabolism were also examined. Elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in 1 of 35 subjects (2.9%) after 4 weeks of treatment. In Trial D described above, calcium metabolism was evaluated in a total of 33 subjects aged 12 to 17 years with plaque psoriasis involving 5-30% of the body surface area who underwent once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment for up to 4 weeks. No cases of hypercalcemia and no clinically relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported. However, one subject had a normal urinary calcium: creatinine ratio at baseline (3.75 mmol/g), which increased above the normal range at week 4 (16 mmol/g). There were no relevant changes in albumin-corrected serum calcium or other markers of calcium metabolism for this subject. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In Trial C described above, the systemic effect of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment in extensive plaque psoriasis was investigated. In this trial, the serum levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 weeks (maximum recommended duration of treatment) and also after 8 weeks of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp. Both calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate were below the lower limit of quantification in all serum samples of the 34 subjects evaluated. However, one major metabolite of calcipotriene (MC1080) was quantifiable in 10 of 34 (29.4%) subjects at week 4 and in five of 12 (41.7%) subjects at week 8. The major metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) was also quantifiable in 19 of 34 (55.9%) subjects at week 4 and seven of 12 (58.3%) subjects at week 8. The serum concentrations for MC1080 ranged from 20-75 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Metabolism Calcipotriene: Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid and occurs in the liver. The primary metabolites of calcipotriene are less potent than the parent compound. Calcipotriene is metabolized to MC1046 (the alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone analogue of calcipotriene), which is metabolized further to MC1080 (a saturated ketone analogue). MC1080 is the major metabolite in plasma. MC1080 is slowly metabolized to calcitroic acid. Betamethasone dipropionate: Betamethasone dipropionate is metabolized to betamethasone 17-propionate and betamethasone, including the 6beta-hydroxy derivatives of those compounds by hydrolysis. Betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) is the primary metabolite."

Subjects were randomized to one of four treatment arms: calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment, calcipotriene hydrate 50 mcg/g in the same vehicle, betamethasone dipropionate 0.64 mg/g in the same vehicle, and vehicle alone. The mean age of the subjects was 48.4 years and 60.5% were male. Most subjects had disease of moderate severity at baseline. Efficacy was assessed as the proportion of subjects with absent or very mild disease according to the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment of Disease Severity at end of treatment (4 weeks). \u201cAbsent\u201d disease was defined as no evidence of redness, thickness, or scaling. \u201cVery mild disease\u201d was defined as controlled disease, but not entirely cleared: lesions with some discoloration with absolutely minimal thickness, i.e. the edges to the lesion(s) could just be felt.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed. If either occurs, discontinue treatment until parameters of calcium metabolism normalize. (5.1) Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency during and after withdrawal of treatment. Risk factors include the use of high-potency topical corticosteroid, use over a large surface area or to areas under occlusion, prolonged use, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and use in pediatric patients. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. (5.2, 8.4) Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment may increase the risk of cataract and glaucoma. If visual symptoms occur, consider referral to an ophthalmologist. (5.3) 5.1 Hypercalcemia and Hypercalciuria Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed with use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. If hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria develops, treatment should be discontinued until parameters of calcium metabolism have normalized. In the trials that included assessment of the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on calcium metabolism, such testing was done after 4 weeks of treatment. The effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on calcium metabolism following treatment durations of longer than 4 weeks have not been evaluated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . 5.2 Effects on Endocrine System Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency corticosteroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the cosyntropin stimulation test [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a trial evaluating the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension and calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the HPA axis, 32 adult subjects were treated with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp and calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression was identified in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . The effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the HPA axis following treatment durations of longer than 4 weeks have not been adequately studied. If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid. Cushing's syndrome and hyperglycemia may also occur due to the systemic effects of topical corticosteroids. These complications are rare and generally occur after prolonged exposure to excessively large doses, especially of high-potency topical corticosteroids. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their higher skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. 5.3 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids, including Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment, may increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Glaucoma and cataracts have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products, including topical clobetasol products. Avoid contact of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.5 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Calcipotriene Allergic contact dermatitis has been observed with use of topical calcipotriene. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.6 Skin Irritation If irritation develops, treatment with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.7 Risk of Ultraviolet Light Exposure Patients who apply Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment to exposed skin should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight, including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc. Physicians may wish to limit or avoid use of phototherapy in patients who use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment."

Other less common reactions (less than 1% but more than 0.1%) were, in decreasing order of incidence, folliculitis, rash papular, rash pustular, and skin hypopigmentation. Skin atrophy, telangiectasia and skin hyperpigmentation were reported infrequently (0.1%). In a separate trial, subjects (N = 207) with at least moderate disease severity were given calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment intermittently on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis for up to 52 weeks. The median use was 15.4 g per week. The effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on calcium metabolism were not studied and the effects on the HPA axis were not adequately studied. The following adverse reactions were reported by 1% or more of the subjects: pruritus (7.2%), psoriasis (3.4%), skin atrophy (1.9%), folliculitis (1.4%), burning sensation (1.4%), skin depigmentation (1.4%), ecchymosis (1.0%), erythema (1.0%) and hand dermatitis (1.0%). One case of serious flare-up of psoriasis was reported. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions associated with the use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment have been identified post-approval: pustular psoriasis and rebound effect. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Postmarketing reports for local adverse reactions to topical corticosteroids may also include: striae, dryness, acneiform eruptions, perioral dermatitis, secondary infection and miliaria."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment contains calcipotriene and bethamethasone dipropionate. The limited data with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment and calcipotriene use in pregnant women are not sufficient to evaluate a Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment-associated or calcipotriene-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Observational studies suggest an increased risk of having low birthweight infants with the maternal use of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women that Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment may increase the potential risk of having a low birth weight infant and to use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs ( see Data ). Oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis had no apparent effects on embryo-fetal development. Subcutaneous administration of betamethasone dipropionate to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, and fetal malformations (cleft palate and crooked or short tail) ( see Data ). The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposures of calcipotriene and betamethasone diproprionate observed in animal studies to the systemic exposures that would be expected in humans after topical use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Available observational studies in pregnant women did not identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, preterm delivery, or fetal mortality with the use of topical corticosteroids of any potency. However, when the dispensed amount of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids exceeded 300 g during the entire pregnancy, maternal use was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight in infants. Animal Data Embryo-fetal development studies with calcipotriene were performed by the oral route in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats received dosages of 0, 6, 18, or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-15 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). There were no apparent effects on maternal survival, behavior, or body weight gain, no effects on litter parameters, and no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses. Fetuses from dams dosed at 54 mcg/kg/day exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. Pregnant rabbits were dosed daily with calcipotriene at exposures of 0, 4, 12, or 36 mcg/kg/day (0, 48, 144, and 432 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Mean maternal body weight gain was reduced in animals dosed at 12 or 36 mcg/kg/day. The incidence of fetal deaths was increased in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day; reduced fetal weight was also observed in this group. The incidence of major malformations among fetuses was not affected. An increase in the incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including incomplete ossification of sternebrae, pubic bones, and forelimb phalanges, was observed in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day. Embryo-fetal development studies with betamethasone dipropionate were performed via subcutaneous injection in mice and rabbits. Pregnant mice were administered doses of 0, 156, 625, or 2500 mcg/kg/day (0, 468, 1875, and 7500 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 7 through 13 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, malformations (increased incidence of the cleft palate and crooked or short tail), and minor skeletal abnormalities (delayed ossification of vertebra and sternebrae). Fetal toxicity was observed at the lowest exposure that was evaluated (156 mcg/kg/day). Pregnant rabbits were injected subcutaneously at dosages of 0, 0.625, 2.5, and 10 mcg/kg/day (0, 7.5, 30, and 120 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6 through 18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, external malformations (including malformed ears, cleft palate, umbilical hernia, kinked tail, club foot, and club hand), and skeletal malformations (including absence of phalanges of the first digit and cranial dysplasia) at dosages of 2.5 mcg/kg/day and above. Calcipotriene was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 6, 18 or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 15 through day 20 postpartum. No remarkable effects were observed on any parameter, including survival, behavior, body weight, litter parameters, or the ability to nurse or rear pups. Betamethasone dipropionate was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day (0, 600, 1800, and 6000 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 6 through day 20 postpartum. Mean maternal body weight was significantly reduced on gestation day 20 in animals dosed at 300 and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean duration of gestation was slightly, but statistically significantly, increased at 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean percentage of pups that survived to day 4 was reduced in relation to dosage. On lactation day 5, the percentage of pups with a reflex to right themselves when placed on their back was significantly reduced at 1000 mcg/ kg/day. No effects on the ability of pups to learn were observed, and the ability of the offspring of treated rats to reproduce was not affected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topically administered calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. It is not known whether topically administered calcipotriene or corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of the use of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment in pediatric patients under the age of 12 years have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment for the treatment of plaque psoriasis have been established in the age group 12 to 17 years. In a prospective, uncontrolled trial, 33 pediatric subjects ages 12-17 years with plaque psoriasis on the body were treated with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment for 4 weeks up to a maximum of 55.8 g per week. Subjects were assessed for HPA axis suppression and effects on calcium metabolism. No adverse effects on adrenal suppression were observed. No hypercalcemia was observed but one subject had a possible treatment-related increase in urinary calcium [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical drugs. They are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency upon the use of topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Rare systemic toxicities such as Cushing\u2019s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids. Local adverse reactions including striae have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in the clinical studies of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment, approximately 14% were 65 years and older and approximately 3% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. All other reported clinical experience has not identified any differences in response between elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

The limited data with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment and calcipotriene use in pregnant women are not sufficient to evaluate a Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment-associated or calcipotriene-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Observational studies suggest an increased risk of having low birthweight infants with the maternal use of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women that Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment may increase the potential risk of having a low birth weight infant and to use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs ( see Data ). Oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis had no apparent effects on embryo-fetal development. Subcutaneous administration of betamethasone dipropionate to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, and fetal malformations (cleft palate and crooked or short tail) ( see Data ). The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposures of calcipotriene and betamethasone diproprionate observed in animal studies to the systemic exposures that would be expected in humans after topical use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Available observational studies in pregnant women did not identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, preterm delivery, or fetal mortality with the use of topical corticosteroids of any potency. However, when the dispensed amount of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids exceeded 300 g during the entire pregnancy, maternal use was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight in infants. Animal Data Embryo-fetal development studies with calcipotriene were performed by the oral route in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats received dosages of 0, 6, 18, or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-15 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). There were no apparent effects on maternal survival, behavior, or body weight gain, no effects on litter parameters, and no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses. Fetuses from dams dosed at 54 mcg/kg/day exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. Pregnant rabbits were dosed daily with calcipotriene at exposures of 0, 4, 12, or 36 mcg/kg/day (0, 48, 144, and 432 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Mean maternal body weight gain was reduced in animals dosed at 12 or 36 mcg/kg/day. The incidence of fetal deaths was increased in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day; reduced fetal weight was also observed in this group. The incidence of major malformations among fetuses was not affected. An increase in the incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including incomplete ossification of sternebrae, pubic bones, and forelimb phalanges, was observed in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day. Embryo-fetal development studies with betamethasone dipropionate were performed via subcutaneous injection in mice and rabbits. Pregnant mice were administered doses of 0, 156, 625, or 2500 mcg/kg/day (0, 468, 1875, and 7500 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 7 through 13 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, malformations (increased incidence of the cleft palate and crooked or short tail), and minor skeletal abnormalities (delayed ossification of vertebra and sternebrae). Fetal toxicity was observed at the lowest exposure that was evaluated (156 mcg/kg/day). Pregnant rabbits were injected subcutaneously at dosages of 0, 0.625, 2.5, and 10 mcg/kg/day (0, 7.5, 30, and 120 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6 through 18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, external malformations (including malformed ears, cleft palate, umbilical hernia, kinked tail, club foot, and club hand), and skeletal malformations (including absence of phalanges of the first digit and cranial dysplasia) at dosages of 2.5 mcg/kg/day and above. Calcipotriene was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 6, 18 or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 15 through day 20 postpartum. No remarkable effects were observed on any parameter, including survival, behavior, body weight, litter parameters, or the ability to nurse or rear pups. Betamethasone dipropionate was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day (0, 600, 1800, and 6000 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 6 through day 20 postpartum. Mean maternal body weight was significantly reduced on gestation day 20 in animals dosed at 300 and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean duration of gestation was slightly, but statistically significantly, increased at 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean percentage of pups that survived to day 4 was reduced in relation to dosage. On lactation day 5, the percentage of pups with a reflex to right themselves when placed on their back was significantly reduced at 1000 mcg/ kg/day. No effects on the ability of pups to learn were observed, and the ability of the offspring of treated rats to reproduce was not affected."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of the use of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment in pediatric patients under the age of 12 years have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment for the treatment of plaque psoriasis have been established in the age group 12 to 17 years. In a prospective, uncontrolled trial, 33 pediatric subjects ages 12-17 years with plaque psoriasis on the body were treated with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment for 4 weeks up to a maximum of 55.8 g per week. Subjects were assessed for HPA axis suppression and effects on calcium metabolism. No adverse effects on adrenal suppression were observed. No hypercalcemia was observed but one subject had a possible treatment-related increase in urinary calcium [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical drugs. They are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency upon the use of topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Rare systemic toxicities such as Cushing\u2019s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids. Local adverse reactions including striae have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment combines the pharmacological effects of calcipotriene as a synthetic vitamin D 3 analogue and betamethasone dipropionate as a synthetic corticosteroid. However, while their pharmacologic and clinical effects are known, the exact mechanisms of their actions in plaque psoriasis are unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Vasoconstriction: In a vasoconstrictor trial in healthy subjects, the skin blanching response of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was consistent with that of a potent corticosteroid when compared with other topical corticosteroids. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression: HPA axis suppression was evaluated in four trials (Trial A, B, C and D) following the application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. In Trial A, calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was applied once daily for 4 weeks to adult subjects (N = 12) with plaque psoriasis to study its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Of eleven subjects tested, none demonstrated adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level \u2264 18 mcg/dL. In Trial B, calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was evaluated in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis (N = 19). One subject demonstrated adrenal suppression. In Trial C, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=32) with extensive plaque psoriasis involving at least 30% of the scalp and, in total, 15-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minutes post-stimulation cortisol level < 18 mcg/dL was observed in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment as per the recommended duration of use [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . In Trial D, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in subjects 12 to 17 years (N=32) with plaque psoriasis of the body involving 5-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment to the affected areas for up to 4 weeks. Mean weekly dose was 29.6 g with a range of 8.1-55.8 g/week. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level \u226418 mcg/dL was observed in none of 32 evaluable subjects after 4 weeks of treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Effects on Calcium Metabolism In Trial C described above, the effects of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp on calcium metabolism were also examined. Elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in 1 of 35 subjects (2.9%) after 4 weeks of treatment. In Trial D described above, calcium metabolism was evaluated in a total of 33 subjects aged 12 to 17 years with plaque psoriasis involving 5-30% of the body surface area who underwent once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment for up to 4 weeks. No cases of hypercalcemia and no clinically relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported. However, one subject had a normal urinary calcium: creatinine ratio at baseline (3.75 mmol/g), which increased above the normal range at week 4 (16 mmol/g). There were no relevant changes in albumin-corrected serum calcium or other markers of calcium metabolism for this subject. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In Trial C described above, the systemic effect of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment in extensive plaque psoriasis was investigated. In this trial, the serum levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 weeks (maximum recommended duration of treatment) and also after 8 weeks of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp. Both calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate were below the lower limit of quantification in all serum samples of the 34 subjects evaluated. However, one major metabolite of calcipotriene (MC1080) was quantifiable in 10 of 34 (29.4%) subjects at week 4 and in five of 12 (41.7%) subjects at week 8. The major metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) was also quantifiable in 19 of 34 (55.9%) subjects at week 4 and seven of 12 (58.3%) subjects at week 8. The serum concentrations for MC1080 ranged from 20-75 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Metabolism Calcipotriene: Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid and occurs in the liver. The primary metabolites of calcipotriene are less potent than the parent compound. Calcipotriene is metabolized to MC1046 (the alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone analogue of calcipotriene), which is metabolized further to MC1080 (a saturated ketone analogue). MC1080 is the major metabolite in plasma. MC1080 is slowly metabolized to calcitroic acid. Betamethasone dipropionate: Betamethasone dipropionate is metabolized to betamethasone 17-propionate and betamethasone, including the 6beta-hydroxy derivatives of those compounds by hydrolysis. Betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) is the primary metabolite."

Subjects were randomized to one of four treatment arms: calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment, calcipotriene hydrate 50 mcg/g in the same vehicle, betamethasone dipropionate 0.64 mg/g in the same vehicle, and vehicle alone. The mean age of the subjects was 48.4 years and 60.5% were male. Most subjects had disease of moderate severity at baseline. Efficacy was assessed as the proportion of subjects with absent or very mild disease according to the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment of Disease Severity at end of treatment (4 weeks). \u201cAbsent\u201d disease was defined as no evidence of redness, thickness, or scaling. \u201cVery mild disease\u201d was defined as controlled disease, but not entirely cleared: lesions with some discoloration with absolutely minimal thickness, i.e. the edges to the lesion(s) could just be felt.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed. If either occurs, discontinue treatment until parameters of calcium metabolism normalize. ( 5.1 ) Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency during and after withdrawal of treatment. Risk factors include the use of high-potency topical corticosteroid, use over a large surface area or to areas under occlusion, prolonged use, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and use in pediatric patients. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.2, 8.4 ) Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment may increase the risk of cataract and glaucoma. If visual symptoms occur, consider referral to an ophthalmologist. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hypercalcemia and Hypercalciuria Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed with use of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment. If hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria develops, treatment should be discontinued until parameters of calcium metabolism have normalized. In the trials that included assessment of the effects of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on calcium metabolism, such testing was done after 4 weeks of treatment. The effects of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on calcium metabolism following treatment durations of longer than 4 weeks have not been evaluated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 5.2 Effects on Endocrine System Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency corticosteroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the cosyntropin stimulation test [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. In a trial evaluating the effects of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension and Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the HPA axis, 32 adult subjects were treated with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension on the scalp and Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression was identified in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . The effects of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the HPA axis following treatment durations of longer than 4 weeks have not been adequately studied. If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid. Cushing's syndrome and hyperglycemia may also occur due to the systemic effects of topical corticosteroids. These complications are rare and generally occur after prolonged exposure to excessively large doses, especially of high-potency topical corticosteroids. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their higher skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. 5.3 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids, including Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment, may increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Glaucoma and cataracts have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products, including topical clobetasol products. Avoid contact of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.5 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Calcipotriene Allergic contact dermatitis has been observed with use of topical calcipotriene. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.6 Skin Irritation If irritation develops, treatment with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.7 Risk of Ultraviolet Light Exposure Patients who apply Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment to exposed skin should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight, including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc. Physicians may wish to limit or avoid use of phototherapy in patients who use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment."

The following adverse reactions were reported by 1% or more of the subjects: pruritus (7.2%), psoriasis (3.4%), skin atrophy (1.9%), folliculitis (1.4%), burning sensation (1.4%), skin depigmentation (1.4%), ecchymosis (1.0%), erythema (1.0%) and hand dermatitis (1.0%). One case of serious flare-up of psoriasis was reported. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions associated with the use of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment have been identified post-approval: pustular psoriasis and rebound effect. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Postmarketing reports for local adverse reactions to topical corticosteroids may also include: striae, dryness, acneiform eruptions, perioral dermatitis, secondary infection and miliaria."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment contains calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate. The limited data with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment and calcipotriene use in pregnant women are not sufficient to evaluate a Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment-associated or calcipotriene-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Observational studies suggest an increased risk of having low birthweight infants with the maternal use of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women that Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment may increase the potential risk of having a low birth weight infant and to use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs (see Data ) . Oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis had no apparent effects on embryo-fetal development. Subcutaneous administration of betamethasone dipropionate to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, and fetal malformations (cleft palate and crooked or short tail) (see Data ) . The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposures of calcipotriene and betamethasone diproprionate observed in animal studies to the systemic exposures that would be expected in humans after topical use of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Available observational studies in pregnant women did not identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, preterm delivery, or fetal mortality with the use of topical corticosteroids of any potency. However, when the dispensed amount of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids exceeded 300 g during the entire pregnancy, maternal use was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight in infants. Animal Data Embryo-fetal development studies with calcipotriene were performed by the oral route in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats received dosages of 0, 6, 18, or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-15 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). There were no apparent effects on maternal survival, behavior, or body weight gain, no effects on litter parameters, and no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses. Fetuses from dams dosed at 54 mcg/kg/day exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. Pregnant rabbits were dosed daily with calcipotriene at exposures of 0, 4, 12, or 36 mcg/kg/day (0, 48, 144, and 432 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6-18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Mean maternal body weight gain was reduced in animals dosed at 12 or 36 mcg/kg/day. The incidence of fetal deaths was increased in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day; reduced fetal weight was also observed in this group. The incidence of major malformations among fetuses was not affected. An increase in the incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including incomplete ossification of sternebrae, pubic bones, and forelimb phalanges, was observed in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day. Embryo-fetal development studies with betamethasone dipropionate were performed via subcutaneous injection in mice and rabbits. Pregnant mice were administered doses of 0, 156, 625, or 2500 mcg/kg/day (0, 468, 1875, and 7500 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 7 through 13 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, malformations (increased incidence of the cleft palate and crooked or short tail), and minor skeletal abnormalities (delayed ossification of vertebra and sternebrae). Fetal toxicity was observed at the lowest exposure that was evaluated (156 mcg/kg/day). Pregnant rabbits were injected subcutaneously at dosages of 0, 0.625, 2.5, and 10 mcg/kg/day (0, 7.5, 30, and 120 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) on days 6 through 18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, external malformations (including malformed ears, cleft palate, umbilical hernia, kinked tail, club foot, and club hand), and skeletal malformations (including absence of phalanges of the first digit and cranial dysplasia) at dosages of 2.5 mcg/kg/day and above. Calcipotriene was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 6, 18 or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 15 through day 20 postpartum. No remarkable effects were observed on any parameter, including survival, behavior, body weight, litter parameters, or the ability to nurse or rear pups. Betamethasone dipropionate was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day (0, 600, 1800, and 6000 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively) from gestation day 6 through day 20 postpartum. Mean maternal body weight was significantly reduced on gestation day 20 in animals dosed at 300 and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean duration of gestation was slightly, but statistically significantly, increased at 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean percentage of pups that survived to day 4 was reduced in relation to dosage. On lactation day 5, the percentage of pups with a reflex to right themselves when placed on their back was significantly reduced at 1000 mcg/ kg/day. No effects on the ability of pups to learn were observed, and the ability of the offspring of treated rats to reproduce was not affected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topically administered calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. It is not known whether topically administered calcipotriene or corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of the use of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment in pediatric patients under the age of 12 years have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment for the treatment of plaque psoriasis have been established in the age group 12 to 17 years. In a prospective, uncontrolled trial, 33 pediatric subjects ages 12-17 years with plaque psoriasis on the body were treated with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment for 4 weeks up to a maximum of 55.8 g per week. Subjects were assessed for HPA axis suppression and effects on calcium metabolism. No adverse effects on adrenal suppression were observed. No hypercalcemia was observed but one subject had a possible treatment-related increase in urinary calcium [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical drugs. They are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency upon the use of topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Rare systemic toxicities such as Cushing's syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids. Local adverse reactions including striae have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in the clinical studies of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment, approximately 14% were 65 years and older and approximately 3% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. All other reported clinical experience has not identified any differences in response between elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment combines the pharmacological effects of calcipotriene hydrate as a synthetic vitamin D 3 analogue and betamethasone dipropionate as a synthetic corticosteroid. However, while their pharmacologic and clinical effects are known, the exact mechanisms of their actions in plaque psoriasis are unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Vasoconstriction : In a vasoconstrictor trial in healthy subjects, the skin blanching response of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment was consistent with that of a potent corticosteroid when compared with other topical corticosteroids. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression: HPA axis suppression was evaluated in four trials (Trial A, B, C and D) following the application of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment. In Trial A, Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment was applied once daily for 4 weeks to adult subjects (N = 12) with plaque psoriasis to study its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Of eleven subjects tested, none demonstrated adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level \u2264 18 mcg/dL. In Trial B, Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment was evaluated in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis (N = 19). One subject demonstrated adrenal suppression. In Trial C, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=32) with extensive plaque psoriasis involving at least 30% of the scalp and, in total, 15-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of Taclonex Scalp \u00ae Topical Suspension on the scalp in combination with Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minutes post-stimulation cortisol level < 18 mcg/dL was observed in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment as per the recommended duration of use [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. In Trial D, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in subjects 12 to 17 years (N=32) with plaque psoriasis of the body involving 5-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment to the affected areas for up to 4 weeks. Mean weekly dose was 29.6 g with a range of 8.1-55.8 g/week. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level \u226418 mcg/dL was observed in none of 32 evaluable subjects after 4 weeks of treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Effects on Calcium Metabolism In Trial C described above, the effects of once daily application of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the body in combination with Taclonex Scalp \u00ae Topical Suspension on the scalp on calcium metabolism were also examined. Elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in 1 of 35 subjects (2.9%) after 4 weeks of treatment. In Trial D described above, calcium metabolism was evaluated in a total of 33 subjects aged 12 to 17 years with plaque psoriasis involving 5-30% of the body surface area who underwent once daily application of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment for up to 4 weeks. No cases of hypercalcemia and no clinically relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported. However, one subject had a normal urinary calcium:creatinine ratio at baseline (3.75 mmol/g), which increased above the normal range at week 4 (16 mmol/g). There were no relevant changes in albumin-corrected serum calcium or other markers of calcium metabolism for this subject. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In Trial C described above, the systemic effect of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment in extensive plaque psoriasis was investigated. In this trial, the serum levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 weeks (maximum recommended duration of treatment) and also after 8 weeks of once daily application of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment on the body in combination with Taclonex Scalp \u00ae Topical Suspension on the scalp. Both calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate were below the lower limit of quantification in all serum samples of the 34 subjects evaluated. However, one major metabolite of calcipotriene (MC1080) was quantifiable in 10 of 34 (29.4%) subjects at week 4 and in five of 12 (41.7%) subjects at week 8. The major metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) was also quantifiable in 19 of 34 (55.9%) subjects at week 4 and seven of 12 (58.3%) subjects at week 8. The serum concentrations for MC1080 ranged from 20-75 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Metabolism Calcipotriene: Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid and occurs in the liver. The primary metabolites of calcipotriene are less potent than the parent compound. Calcipotriene is metabolized to MC1046 (the alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone analogue of calcipotriene), which is metabolized further to MC1080 (a saturated ketone analogue). MC1080 is the major metabolite in plasma. MC1080 is slowly metabolized to calcitroic acid. Betamethasone dipropionate: Betamethasone dipropionate is metabolized to betamethasone 17-propionate and betamethasone, including the 6beta-hydroxy derivatives of those compounds by hydrolysis. Betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) is the primary metabolite."

A 104-week oral carcinogenicity study was conducted with calcipotriene in male and female rats at doses of 1, 5 and 15 mcg/kg/day (6, 30, and 90 mcg/m 2 /day, respectively). Beginning week 71, the dosage for high-dose animals of both genders was reduced to 10 mcg/kg/day (60 mcg/m 2 /day). A treatment-related increase in benign C-cell adenomas was observed in the thyroid of females that received 15 mcg/kg/day. A treatment-related increase in benign pheochromocytomas was observed in the adrenal glands of males that received 15 mcg/kg/day. No other statistically significant differences in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. The relevance of these findings to patients is unknown. When betamethasone dipropionate was applied topically to CD-1 mice for up to 24 months at dosages approximating 1.3, 4.2 and 8.5 mcg/kg/day in females, and 1.3, 4.2, and 12.9 mcg/kg/day in males (up to 26 mcg/m 2 /day and 39 mcg/m 2 /day, in females and males, respectively), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Clinical Trials Conducted in Subjects 18 years and older with Plaque Psoriasis In an international, multi-center, double-blind, vehicle- and active-controlled, parallel-group trial, 1603 subjects with mild to very severe plaque psoriasis on trunk and limbs were treated once daily for 4 weeks. Subjects were randomized to one of four treatment arms: Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Ointment, calcipotriene hydrate 50 mcg/g in the same vehicle, betamethasone dipropionate 0.64 mg/g in the same vehicle, and vehicle alone. The mean age of the subjects was 48.4 years and 60.5% were male. Most subjects had disease of moderate severity at baseline. Efficacy was assessed as the proportion of subjects with absent or very mild disease according to the Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Severity at end of treatment (4 weeks). \"Absent\" disease was defined as no evidence of redness, thickness, or scaling. \"Very mild disease\" was defined as controlled disease, but not entirely cleared: lesions with some discoloration with absolutely minimal thickness, i.e. the edges to the lesion(s) could just be felt. Table 3 contains the response rates for this trial. Table 3 Percentage of Subjects with Absent or Very Mild Disease According to the Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Severity at End of Treatment (4 weeks) Subjects with mild disease at baseline were required to have \"Absent\" disease to be considered a success.

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In humans, the natural supply of vitamin D depends mainly on exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun for conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) in the skin. Calcipotriene is a synthetic analog of vitamin D 3 . Clinical studies with radiolabelled Calcipotriene Ointment indicate that approximately 6% (\u00b1 3%, SD) of the applied dose of calcipotriene is absorbed systemically when the ointment is applied topically to psoriasis plaques, or 5% (\u00b1 2.6%, SD) when applied to normal skin, and much of the absorbed active is converted to inactive metabolites within 24 hours of application. Vitamin D and its metabolites are transported in the blood, bound to specific plasma proteins. The active form of the vitamin, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (calcitriol), is known to be recycled via the liver and excreted in the bile. Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid, and occurs via a similar pathway to the natural hormone. The primary metabolites are much less potent than the parent compound. There is evidence that maternal 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (calcitriol) may enter the fetal circulation, but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. The systemic disposition of calcipotriene is expected to be similar to that of the naturally occurring vitamin."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "CLINICAL STUDIES Adequate and well-controlled trials of patients treated with Calcipotriene Ointment have demonstrated improvement usually beginning after 2 weeks of therapy. This improvement continued in patients using Calcipotriene Ointment once daily and twice daily. After 8 weeks of once daily Calcipotriene Ointment, 56.7% of patients showed at least marked improvements (6.4% showed complete clearing). After 8 weeks of twice daily Calcipotriene Ointment, 70.0% of patients showed at least marked improvement (11.3% showed complete clearing). Subtracting percentages of patients using placebo (vehicle only) from percentages of patients using Calcipotriene Ointment who had at least marked improvements after 8 weeks yields 39.9% for once daily and 49.6% for twice daily. This adjustment for placebo effect indicates that what might appear to be differences between once and twice daily use may reflect differences in the studies independent from the frequency of dosing. Although there was a numerical difference in comparison across studies, twice daily dosing has not been shown to be superior in efficacy to once daily dosing. Over 400 patients have been treated in open label clinical studies of Calcipotriene Ointment for periods of up to one year. In half of these studies, patients who previously had not responded well to Calcipotriene Ointment were excluded. The adverse events in these extended studies included skin irritation in approximately 25% of patients and worsening of psoriasis in approximately 10% of patients. In one of these open label studies, half of the patients no longer required Calcipotriene Ointment by 16 weeks of treatment, because of satisfactory therapeutic results.",
      "Clinical Trials Experience In controlled clinical trials, the most frequent adverse reactions reported for Calcipotriene Ointment were burning, itching and skin irritation, which occurred in approximately 10-15% of patients. Erythema, dry skin, peeling, rash, dermatitis, worsening of psoriasis including development of facial/scalp psoriasis were reported in 1 to 10% of patients. Other experiences reported in less than 1% of patients included skin atrophy, hyperpigmentation, hypercalcemia, and folliculitis. Once daily dosing has not been shown to be superior in safety to twice daily dosing."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Use of Calcipotriene Ointment may cause irritation of lesions and surrounding uninvolved skin. If irritation develops, Calcipotriene Ointment should be discontinued. For external use only. Keep out of the reach of children. Always wash hands thoroughly after use. Transient, rapidly reversible elevation of serum calcium has occurred with use of Calcipotriene Ointment. If elevation in serum calcium outside the normal range should occur, discontinue treatment until normal calcium levels are restored. Information for Patients Patients using Calcipotriene Ointment should receive the following information and instructions: This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the face or eyes. As with any topical medication, patients should wash hands after application. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse reactions. Patients that apply Calcipotriene Ointment to exposed portions of the body should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight (including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc.). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility When calcipotriene was applied topically to mice for up to 24 months at dosages of 3, 10 and 30 \u03bcg/kg/day (corresponding to 9, 30 and 90 \u03bcg/m 2 /day), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. In a study in which albino hairless mice were exposed to both UVR and topically applied calcipotriene, a reduction in the time required for UVR to induce the formation of skin tumors was observed (statistically significant in males only), suggesting that calcipotriene may enhance the effect of UVR to induce skin tumors. Patients that apply Calcipotriene Ointment to exposed portions of the body should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight (including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc.). Physicians may wish to avoid use of phototherapy in patients that use Calcipotriene Ointment. Calcipotriene did not elicit any mutagenic effects in an Ames mutagenicity assay, a mouse lymphoma TK locus assay, a human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay, or in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Studies in rats at doses up to 54 \u03bcg/kg/day (324 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) of calcipotriene indicated no impairment of fertility or general reproductive performance. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Studies of teratogenicity were done by the oral route where bioavailability is expected to be approximately 40-60% of the administered dose. In rabbits, increased maternal and fetal toxicity were noted at a dosage of 12 \u03bcg/kg/day (132 \u03bcg/m 2 /day); a dosage of 36 \u03bcg/kg/day (396 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of incomplete ossification of the pubic bones and forelimb phalanges of fetuses. In a rat study, a dosage of 54 \u03bcg/kg/day (318 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) resulted in a significantly increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities (enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs). The enlarged fontanelles are most likely due to calcipotriene's effect upon calcium metabolism. The estimated maternal and fetal no-effect exposure levels in the rat (43.2 \u03bcg/m2/day) and rabbit (17.6 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) studies are approximately equal to the expected human systemic exposure level (18.5 \u03bcg/m 2 /day) from dermal application. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Calcipotriene Ointment should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether calcipotriene is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Calcipotriene Ointment, 0.005% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Calcipotriene Ointment in pediatric patients have not been established. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at greater risk than adults of systemic adverse effects when they are treated with topical medication. Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of calcipotriene ointment, approximately 12% were 65 or older, while approximately 4% were 75 and over. The results of an analysis of severity of skin-related adverse events showed a statistically significant difference for subjects over 65 years (more severe) compared to those under 65 years (less severe)."
