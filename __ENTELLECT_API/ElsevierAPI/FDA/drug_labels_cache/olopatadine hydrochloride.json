      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Epistaxis, Nasal Ulceration, and Nasal Septal Perforation : Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Discontinue if ulcerations or perforations occur. Avoid use in patients with nasal disease other than allergic rhinitis ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Avoid engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and coordination, such as driving or operating machinery when taking olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Avoid concurrent use of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray ( 5.2 ). 5.1 Local Nasal Effects Epistaxis and Nasal Ulceration In placebo-controlled clinical trials (vehicle nasal spray) of 2 weeks to 12 months duration, epistaxis and nasal ulcerations were reported [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Nasal Septal Perforation Three placebo-controlled long term (12 months) safety trials (vehicle nasal spray) were conducted. In the first safety trial, patients were treated with an investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray containing povidone (not the commercially marketed formulation) or a vehicle nasal spray containing povidone. Nasal septal perforations were reported in one patient treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 2 patients treated with the vehicle nasal spray. In the second safety trial with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, which does not contain povidone, there were no reports of nasal septal perforation. In the third safety trial, one patient exposed to the 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray (containing no povidone) reported a nasal septal perforation [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Before starting olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, conduct a nasal examination to ensure that patients are free of nasal disease other than allergic rhinitis. Perform nasal examinations periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa and consider stopping olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray if patients develop nasal ulcerations. 5.2 Somnolence and Impaired Mental Alertness In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients taking olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray [ see Adverse Reactions 6.1 ]. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as driving or operating machinery after administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. Concurrent use of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most clinically significant adverse reactions described in other sections of labeling include: \u2022 Epistaxis, Nasal Ulceration, and Nasal Septal Perforation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] \u2022 Somnolence and Impaired Mental Alertness [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] The most common (>1%) adverse reactions, included bitter taste, headache, epistaxis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, post-nasal drip, cough, and urinary tract infection in patients 12 years of age and older and epistaxis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, bitter taste, pyrexia, and rash in patients 6 to 11 years of age ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Padagis \u00ae at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below reflect exposure to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray in 2770 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis in 10 controlled clinical trials of 2 weeks to 12 months duration. Olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray is not indicated for use in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. The safety data from adults and adolescents are based upon 6 placebo-controlled clinical trials (3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray or 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray) in which 1834 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (652 males and 1182 females) 12 years of age and older were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily. There were 1180 patients (olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 587; vehicle nasal spray, 593) that participated in 3 efficacy and safety trials of 2 weeks duration. There were 2840 patients (olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 1247; 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, 1251; 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray, 342) that participated in 3 long-term clinical trials of 1-year duration. The racial distribution of adult and adolescent patients receiving olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was 77% white, 9% black, and 14% other. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in these controlled clinical trials was comparable for olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and vehicle nasal spray. Overall, 4.7% of the 1834 adult and adolescent patients across all 6 studies treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 3.5% of the 1844 patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to adverse reactions, and 2.9% of the 342 patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to adverse reactions. The safety data from pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age are based upon 3 clinical trials in which 870 children with seasonal allergic rhinitis (376 females and 494 males) were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray one or two sprays per nostril twice daily for 2 weeks. The racial distribution of pediatric patients receiving olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was 68.6% white, 16.6% black, and 14.8% other. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in these controlled clinical trials was comparable for olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and vehicle nasal spray. Overall, 1.4% of the 870 pediatric patients across all 3 studies treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 1.3% of the 872 pediatric patients treated with vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to adverse reactions. Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older in Short-Term (2-week) Trials There were 1180 patients 12 years of age and older (olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 587; vehicle nasal spray, 593) that participated in 3 efficacy and safety trials of 2 weeks duration. Table 1 presents the most common adverse reactions (0.9% or greater in patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray) that occurred more frequently in patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray compared with vehicle nasal spray in the 3 clinical trials of 2 weeks duration. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 0.9% or Greater in Controlled Clinical Trials of 2 Weeks Duration with Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray in Adolescent and Adult Patients 12 Years of Age and Older With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Reaction Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years and Older Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray N = 587 Vehicle Nasal Spray N = 593 Bitter taste 75 (12.8%) 5 (0.8%) Headache 26 (4.4%) 24 (4.0%) Epistaxis 19 (3.2%) 10 (1.7%) Pharyngolaryngeal Pain 13 (2.2%) 8 (1.3%) Post-nasal drip 9 (1.5%) 5 (0.8%) Cough 8 (1.4%) 3 (0.5%) Urinary tract infection 7 (1.2%) 3 (0.5%) CPK elevation 5 (0.9%) 2 (0.3%) Dry mouth 5 (0.9%) 1 (0.2%) Fatigue 5 (0.9%) 4 (0.7%) Influenza 5 (0.9%) 1 (0.2%) Nasopharyngitis 5 (0.9%) 4 (0.7%) Somnolence 5 (0.9%) 2 (0.3%) Throat irritation 5 (0.9%) 0 (0.0%) There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender or race. Clinical trials did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age There were 1742 pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age (olopatadine nasal spray, 870; vehicle nasal spray, 872) with seasonal allergic rhinitis that participated in 3 clinical trials of 2 weeks duration. Two of the studies used the investigational formulation of olopatadine nasal spray, and one of the studies used olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. One study evaluated the safety of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray at doses of one and two sprays per nostril twice daily in 1188 patients, in which 298 were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 1 spray, 296 were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 2 sprays, 297 were exposed to vehicle 1 spray, and 297 were exposed to vehicle 2 sprays twice daily for 2 weeks. Table 2 presents the most common adverse reactions (greater than 1.0% in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray one spray per nostril) that occurred more frequently with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray compared with vehicle nasal spray. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of Greater than 1.0% in a Controlled Clinical Trial of 2 Weeks Duration With Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray in Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Reaction Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray One Spray per Nostril N = 298 Vehicle Nasal Spray One Spray per Nostril N = 297 Epistaxis Headache Upper respiratory tract infection Bitter taste 17 (5.7%) 13 (4.4%) 8 (2.6%) 3 (1.0%) 11 (3.7%) 11 (3.7%) 0 0 Pyrexia 4 (1.3%) 3 (1.0%) Rash 4 (1.3%) 0 There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender, race, or ethnicity. Long-Term (12 month) Safety Trials In a 12-month, placebo-controlled, safety trial (vehicle nasal spray), 890 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were randomized to treatment with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily (445 patients) or vehicle nasal spray (445 patients). In the olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and vehicle nasal spray groups, 72% and 74% of patients, respectively, completed the trial. Overall, 7% and 5%, respectively, discontinued study participation due to an adverse reaction. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was epistaxis, which occurred in 25% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 28% in patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Epistaxis resulted in discontinuation of 0.9% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 0.2% of patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulcerations occurred in 10% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 9% of patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulcerations resulted in discontinuation of 0.4% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 0.2% patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. There were no patients with nasal septal perforation in either treatment group. Somnolence was reported in 1 patient treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. Weight increase was reported in 6 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. Depression or worsening of depression occurred in 9 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and in 5 patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Three patients, 2 of whom had preexisting histories of depression, who received olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray were hospitalized for depression compared to none who received vehicle nasal spray. In a second 12-month, placebo-controlled, safety trial (vehicle nasal spray), 459 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with two sprays per nostril of an investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray containing povidone (not the commercially marketed formulation) and 465 patients were treated with 2 sprays of a vehicle nasal spray containing povidone. Nasal septal perforations were reported in one patient treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 2 patients treated with the vehicle nasal spray. Epistaxis was reported in 19% of patients treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 12% of patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Somnolence was reported in 3 patients treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray compared to 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. Fatigue was reported in 5 patients treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray compared to 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. In a third 3-arm, 12-month, placebo-controlled, safety trial (vehicle nasal spray), conducted post approval, 1026 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were randomized to treatment with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray (343 patients), a 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray (341 patients), or a 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray (342 patients). All treatments were administered as two sprays per nostril, twice daily. Overall, 5% of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray patients, 2% of 3.7 pH vehicle patients and 3% of 7.0 pH vehicle patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was epistaxis, which occurred in 24% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 20% of patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, and 23% of patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. Epistaxis resulted in the discontinuation of 2 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 1 patient treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. Nasal septal perforation was reported for one patient treated with the 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulcerations occurred in 9% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 8% of patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, and 9% of patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulceration resulted in the discontinuation of 1 patient treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. Hyposmia and anosmia were each reported by one patient treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. Neither somnolence nor weight loss was reported. Depression occurred in 3 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 2 patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, and 3 patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. There were no long-term clinical trials in children below 12 years of age. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most common adverse reactions reported include dizziness, dysgeusia, epistaxis, headache, nasal discomfort, oropharyngeal pain, and somnolence. Additionally, hyposmia and anosmia have been reported with the use of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from postmarketing experience with antihistamines, with similar mechanism of action to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, there are no published human data specific to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of olopatadine hydrochloride to pregnant rats and rabbits caused a decrease in the number of live fetuses at maternal doses approximately 110 and 1460 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4%, and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an oral embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rabbits were dosed throughout the period of organogenesis at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. A decrease in the number of live fetuses was observed at 400 mg/kg/day (1460 times the MRHDID, on a mg/m 2 basis). In an oral embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rats were dosed throughout the period of organogenesis at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. Maternal toxicity, producing death and reduced maternal body weight gain was observed at 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 1100 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis). Olopatadine produced cleft palate at 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 110 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis) and decreased embryo-fetal viability and reduced fetal weight in rats at 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 1100 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis). In peri-/postnatal toxicity studies, pregnant rats received oral doses of olopatadine up to 600 mg/kg/day during late gestation and throughout the lactation period. Olopatadine produced decreased neonatal survival at 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 110 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis) and reduced body weight gain in pups at 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 7 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis). These effects appeared attributable to exposure of pups via the milk as demonstrated in a cross-fostered study in which pups of untreated dams cross-fostered to dams treated with 60 mg/kg/day olopatadine orally during the lactation period exhibited decreased body weight gain. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of olopatadine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Although orally administered olopatadine is present in rat milk, there is no information about nasally administered olopatadine. It is not known whether topical nasal administration could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human breast milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and any potential adverse effects on the breast fed infant from olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age are supported by 3 vehicle-controlled 2-week studies in 870 patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Doses studied included one and two sprays per nostril twice daily. One of these studies evaluated the safety of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray at doses of one and two sprays per nostril twice daily in 1,188 patients, of which 298 patients were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 1 spray and 297 patients were exposed to vehicle 1 spray. In this study, the incidence of epistaxis with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray use was 5.7% [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older are supported by 3 randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 weeks duration in adult and adolescent patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . In these studies, the incidence of epistaxis with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray use in 587 patients was 3.2% [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray have not been established in pediatric patients under 6 years of age. The safety of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray at a dose of one spray per nostril twice daily was evaluated in one 2-week vehicle-controlled study in 132 pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis. In this trial, 66 patients were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. The most common (greater than 1.0%) adverse reactions reported were diarrhea (9.1%), epistaxis (6.1%), rhinorrhea (4.5%), bitter taste (3.0%) and wheezing (3.0%). Diarrhea was reported more frequently (9.1%) in patients 2 to 5 years of age than 6 to 11 year old age group (< 1%). 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from postmarketing experience with antihistamines, with similar mechanism of action to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, there are no published human data specific to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of olopatadine hydrochloride to pregnant rats and rabbits caused a decrease in the number of live fetuses at maternal doses approximately 110 and 1460 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4%, and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an oral embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rabbits were dosed throughout the period of organogenesis at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. A decrease in the number of live fetuses was observed at 400 mg/kg/day (1460 times the MRHDID, on a mg/m 2 basis). In an oral embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rats were dosed throughout the period of organogenesis at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Olopatadine is a histamine H 1 receptor antagonist. The antihistaminic activity of olopatadine has been documented in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a placebo-controlled cardiovascular safety study, 32 healthy volunteers received 20 mg oral solution of olopatadine twice daily for 14 days (8-fold greater daily dose than the recommended daily nasal dose). The mean QTcF (QT corrected by Fridericia\u2019s correction method for heart rate) change from baseline was -2.7 msec and -3.8 msec for olopatadine, and placebo, respectively. In this study, 8 subjects treated with olopatadine had a QTcF change from baseline of 30-60 msec, 1 subject had a QTcF change from baseline greater than 60 msec, and no subjects had QTcF values greater than 500 msec. Eight subjects treated with placebo had a QTcF change from baseline of 30-60 msec, no subjects had a QTcF change from baseline greater than 60 msec, and no subjects had QTcF values greater than 500 msec. In a 12-month study in 429 perennial allergic rhinitis patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily, no evidence of any effect of olopatadine hydrochloride on QT prolongation was observed. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of olopatadine were studied after administration by the nasal, oral, intravenous, and topical ocular routes. Olopatadine exhibited linear pharmacokinetics across the routes studied over a large dose range. Absorption Healthy Subjects: Olopatadine was absorbed with individual peak plasma concentrations observed between 30 minutes and 1 hour after twice daily intranasal administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. The mean ( \u00b1 SD) steady-state peak plasma concentration (C max ) of olopatadine was 16.0 \u00b1 8.99 ng/mL. Systemic exposure as indexed by area under the curve (AUC 0-12 ) averaged 66.0 \u00b1 26.8 ng\u00b7h/mL. The average absolute bioavailability of intranasal olopatadine is 57%. The mean accumulation ratio following multiple intranasal administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was about 1.3. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Patients: Systemic exposure of olopatadine in seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients after twice daily intranasal administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was comparable to that observed in healthy subjects. Olopatadine was absorbed with peak plasma concentrations observed between 15 minutes and 2 hours. The mean steady-state C max was 23.3 \u00b1 6.2 ng/mL and AUC 0-12 averaged 78.0 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL. Distribution The protein binding of olopatadine was moderate at approximately 55% in human serum, and independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.1 to 1000 ng/mL. Olopatadine was bound predominately to human serum albumin. Elimination The plasma elimination half-life of olopatadine is 8 to 12 hours. Olopatadine is mainly eliminated through urinary excretion. Approximately 70% of a [ 14 C] olopatadine hydrochloride oral dose was recovered in urine with 17% in the feces. Of the drug-related material recovered within the first 24 hours in the urine, 86% was unchanged olopatadine with the balance comprised of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine. Metabolism Olopatadine is not extensively metabolized. Based on plasma metabolite profiles following oral administration of [ 14 C] olopatadine, at least six minor metabolites circulate in human plasma. Olopatadine accounts for 77% of peak plasma total radioactivity and all metabolites amounted to < 6% combined. Two of these have been identified as the olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine. In in vitro studies with cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP) and flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO), N-desmethyl olopatadine (Ml) formation was catalyzed mainly by CYP3A4, while olopatadine N-oxide (M3) was primarily catalyzed by FMO1 and FMO3. Olopatadine at concentrations up to 33,900 ng/mL did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. The potential for olopatadine and its metabolites to act as inducers of CYP enzymes has not been evaluated. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic study examining the effect of hepatic impairment was conducted. Since metabolism of olopatadine is a minor route of elimination, no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray is warranted in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with Renal Impairment The mean C max values for olopatadine following single nasal doses were not markedly different between healthy subjects (18.1 ng/mL) and patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment (range 15.5 to 21.6 ng/mL). The mean plasma AUC 0-12 was 2-fold higher in patients with severe impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). In these patients, peak steady-state plasma concentrations of olopatadine are approximately 10-fold lower than those observed after higher 20 mg oral doses, twice daily, which were well-tolerated. These findings indicate that no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray is warranted in patients with renal impairment. Male and Female Patients The mean systemic exposure (C max and AUC 0-12 ) in female SAR patients following multiple administration of olopatadine was 40% and 27% higher, respectively than those values observed in male SAR patients. Racial or Ethnic Groups The effects of race on olopatadine pharmacokinetics have not been adequately investigated. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine in patients 6 through 11 years of age were characterized using data from 42 pediatric patients administered olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, one spray per nostril twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max (15.4 \u00b1 7.3 ng/mL) of olopatadine was approximately 2-fold less than was comparable to that observed in adults (78.0 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL). The C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide were comparable to that observed in adults. The C max and AUC 0-12 of N-desmethyl olopatadine are approximately 18% and 37% higher than that observed in adults, respectively. Pediatric Patients 2 to 5 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide, and N-desmethyl olopatadine were characterized using population pharmacokinetic methods applied to sparse data (approximately 5 samples per patient) obtained from 66 pediatric patients (2 to less than 6 years of age) administered one-half the recommended adult dose (one spray per nostril) of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine were 13.4 \u00b1 4.6 ng/mL and 75.0 \u00b1 26.4 ng\u2022hr/mL respectively. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine were similar to that of patients 6 to 11 years of age. Drug Interaction Studies Drug interactions with inhibitors of liver enzymes are not anticipated because olopatadine is eliminated predominantly by renal excretion. Olopatadine did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. Based on these data, drug interactions involving P450 inhibition are not expected. Due to the modest protein binding of olopatadine (55%), drug interactions through displacement from plasma proteins are also not expected."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age and Older The efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray were evaluated in 3 randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials (vehicle nasal spray) of 2 weeks duration in adult and adolescent patients, 12 years of age and older with symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. The 3 clinical trials were conducted in the United States and included 1598 patients (556 males, and 1042 females) 12 years of age and older. In these 3 trials, 587 patients were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 0.6%, 418 patients were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 0.4%, and 593 patients were treated with vehicle nasal spray. Assessment of efficacy was based on patient recording of 4 individual nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, and sneezing) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) as reflective or instantaneous scores. Reflective scoring required patients to record symptom severity over the previous 12 hours; the instantaneous scoring required patients to record symptom severity at the time of recording. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference from placebo in the percent change from baseline in the average of morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) averaged for the 2-week treatment period. In all 3 trials, patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, two sprays per nostril, twice-daily, exhibited statistically significantly greater decreases in rTNSS compared to vehicle nasal spray. Results for the rTNSS from 2 representative trials are shown in Table 3. Table 3: Mean Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) in Adult and Adolescent Patients With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Study No. Treatment N Baseline Change from Baseline Difference from Placebo Estimate 95% CI p-value Study 1 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.6% 183 8.71 -3.63 -0.96 (-1.42, -0.51) <0.0001 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.4% 188 8.90 -3.38 -0.71 (-1.17, -0.26) 0.0023 Vehicle Nasal Spray 191 8.75 -2.67 Study 2 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.6% 220 9.17 -2.90 -0.98 (-1.37, -0.59) <0.0001 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.4% 228 9.26 -2.63 -0.72 (-1.11, -0.33) 0.0003 Vehicle Nasal Spray 223 9.07 -1.92 Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval. Itchy eyes and watery eyes were evaluated as secondary endpoints but eye redness was not evaluated. In 2 of the studies, patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray had significantly greater decreases in reflective symptom scores for itchy eyes and watery eyes, compared to vehicle nasal spray. In the 2-week seasonal allergy trials, onset of action was also evaluated by instantaneous TNSS assessments twice-daily after the first dose of study medication. In these trials, onset of action was seen after 1 day of dosing. Onset of action was evaluated in 3 environmental exposure unit studies with single doses of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. In these studies, patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to high levels of pollen in the environmental exposure unit and then treated with either olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray or vehicle nasal spray, two sprays in each nostril, after which they self-reported their allergy symptoms hourly as instantaneous scores for the subsequent 12 hours. Olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 0.6% was found to have an onset of action of 30 minutes after dosing in the environmental exposure unit. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age There were 3 clinical trials of 2 weeks duration with olopatadine nasal spray in patients 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Efficacy of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was evaluated in 2 of the 3 trials. One of the 2 trials that showed efficacy was a randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo (vehicle nasal spray)-controlled clinical trial of 2 weeks duration, including 1188 children ages 6 to < 12 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Assessment of efficacy was based on patient/caregiver recording of 4 individual nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, and sneezing) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) as reflective or instantaneous scores. Reflective scoring captured symptom severity over the previous 12 hours; the instantaneous scoring captured symptom severity at the time of recording. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference from placebo in the percent change from baseline in the average of patient/caregiver-reported morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) averaged for the 2-week treatment period. Patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, one or two sprays per nostril twice daily, had statistically significantly greater decreases in rTNSS compared to vehicle nasal spray. Results for rTNSS are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Mean Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score in Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Treatment N Baseline Change from Baseline Difference from Placebo Estimate 95% CI p-value Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.6%, one spray per nostril twice daily 294 8.99 -2.24 -0.55 (-0.90, -0.19) 0.0015 Vehicle Nasal Spray, one spray per nostril twice daily 294 9.09 -1.70 Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval. Itchy eyes and watery eyes were evaluated as secondary endpoints in the same study but eye redness was not evaluated. Patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray had significantly greater decreases in reflective symptom scores for itchy eyes and watery eyes, compared to vehicle nasal spray."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Epistaxis, Nasal Ulceration, and Nasal Septal Perforation : Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Discontinue if ulcerations or perforations occur. Avoid use in patients with nasal disease other than allergic rhinitis ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Avoid engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and coordination, such as driving or operating machinery when taking olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Avoid concurrent use of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) ( 5.2 ). 5.1 Local Nasal Effects Epistaxis and Nasal Ulceration In placebo-controlled clinical trials (vehicle nasal spray) of 2 weeks to 12 months duration, epistaxis and nasal ulcerations were reported [ see Adverse Reactions 6.1 ]. Nasal Septal Perforation Three placebo-controlled long term (12 months) safety trials (vehicle nasal spray) were conducted. In the first safety trial, patients were treated with an investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) containing povidone (not the commercially marketed formulation) or a vehicle nasal spray containing povidone. Nasal septal perforations were reported in one patient treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and 2 patients treated with the vehicle nasal spray. In the second safety trial with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), which does not contain povidone, there were no reports of nasal septal perforation. In the third safety trial, one patient exposed to the 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray (containing no povidone) reported a nasal septal perforation [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Before starting olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), conduct a nasal examination to ensure that patients are free of nasal disease other than allergic rhinitis. Perform nasal examinations periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa and consider stopping olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) if patients develop nasal ulcerations. 5.2 Somnolence and Impaired Mental Alertness In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients taking olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as driving or operating machinery after administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray). Concurrent use of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most clinically significant adverse reactions described in other sections of labeling include: \u2022 Epistaxis, Nasal Ulceration, and Nasal Septal Perforation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] \u2022 Somnolence and Impaired Mental Alertness [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] The most common (>1%) adverse reactions, included bitter taste, headache, epistaxis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, post-nasal drip, cough, and urinary tract infection in patients 12 years of age and older and epistaxis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, bitter taste, pyrexia, and rash in patients 6 to 11 years of age ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Perrigo at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below reflect exposure to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) in 2770 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis in 10 controlled clinical trials of 2 weeks to 12 months duration. Olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) is not indicated for use in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. The safety data from adults and adolescents are based upon 6 placebo-controlled clinical trials (3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray or 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray) in which 1834 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (652 males and 1182 females) 12 years of age and older were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) two sprays per nostril twice daily. There were 1180 patients (olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 587; vehicle nasal spray, 593) that participated in 3 efficacy and safety trials of 2 weeks duration. There were 2840 patients (olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 1247; 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, 1251; 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray, 342) that participated in 3 long-term clinical trials of 1-year duration. The racial distribution of adult and adolescent patients receiving olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) was 77% white, 9% black, and 14% other. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in these controlled clinical trials was comparable for olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and vehicle nasal spray. Overall, 4.7% of the 1834 adult and adolescent patients across all 6 studies treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 3.5% of the 1844 patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to adverse reactions, and 2.9% of the 342 patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to adverse reactions. The safety data from pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age are based upon 3 clinical trials in which 870 children with seasonal allergic rhinitis (376 females and 494 males) were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) one or two sprays per nostril twice daily for 2 weeks. The racial distribution of pediatric patients receiving olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) was 68.6% white, 16.6% black, and 14.8% other. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in these controlled clinical trials was comparable for olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and vehicle nasal spray. Overall, 1.4% of the 870 pediatric patients across all 3 studies treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and 1.3% of the 872 pediatric patients treated with vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to adverse reactions. Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older in Short-Term (2-week) Trials There were 1180 patients 12 years of age and older (olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 587; vehicle nasal spray, 593) that participated in 3 efficacy and safety trials of 2 weeks duration. Table 1 presents the most common adverse reactions (0.9% or greater in patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray)) that occurred more frequently in patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) compared with vehicle nasal spray in the 3 clinical trials of 2 weeks duration. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 0.9% or Greater in Controlled Clinical Trials of 2 Weeks Duration with Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray) in Adolescent and Adult Patients 12 Years of Age and Older With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Reaction Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years and Older Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray) N = 587 Vehicle Nasal Spray N = 593 Bitter taste 75 (12.8%) 5 (0.8%) Headache 26 (4.4%) 24 (4.0%) Epistaxis 19 (3.2%) 10 (1.7%) Pharyngolaryngeal Pain 13 (2.2%) 8 (1.3%) Post-nasal drip 9 (1.5%) 5 (0.8%) Cough 8 (1.4%) 3 (0.5%) Urinary tract infection 7 (1.2%) 3 (0.5%) CPK elevation 5 (0.9%) 2 (0.3%) Dry mouth 5 (0.9%) 1 (0.2%) Fatigue 5 (0.9%) 4 (0.7%) Influenza 5 (0.9%) 1 (0.2%) Nasopharyngitis 5 (0.9%) 4 (0.7%) Somnolence 5 (0.9%) 2 (0.3%) Throat irritation 5 (0.9%) 0 (0.0%) There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender or race. Clinical trials did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age There were 1742 pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age (olopatadine nasal spray, 870; vehicle nasal spray, 872) with seasonal allergic rhinitis that participated in 3 clinical trials of 2 weeks duration. Two of the studies used the investigational formulation of olopatadine nasal spray, and one of the studies used olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray). One study evaluated the safety of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) at doses of one and two sprays per nostril twice daily in 1188 patients, in which 298 were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) 1 spray, 296 were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) 2 sprays, 297 were exposed to vehicle 1 spray, and 297 were exposed to vehicle 2 sprays twice daily for 2 weeks. Table 2 presents the most common adverse reactions (greater than 1.0% in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) one spray per nostril) that occurred more frequently with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) compared with vehicle nasal spray. Table 2.

Long-Term (12 month) Safety Trials In a 12-month, placebo-controlled, safety trial (vehicle nasal spray), 890 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were randomized to treatment with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) two sprays per nostril twice daily (445 patients) or vehicle nasal spray (445 patients). In the olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and vehicle nasal spray groups, 72% and 74% of patients, respectively, completed the trial. Overall, 7% and 5%, respectively, discontinued study participation due to an adverse reaction. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was epistaxis, which occurred in 25% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and 28% in patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Epistaxis resulted in discontinuation of 0.9% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and 0.2% of patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulcerations occurred in 10% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and 9% of patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulcerations resulted in discontinuation of 0.4% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and 0.2% patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. There were no patients with nasal septal perforation in either treatment group. Somnolence was reported in 1 patient treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. Weight increase was reported in 6 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. Depression or worsening of depression occurred in 9 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and in 5 patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Three patients, 2 of whom had preexisting histories of depression, who received olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) were hospitalized for depression compared to none who received vehicle nasal spray. In a second 12-month, placebo-controlled, safety trial (vehicle nasal spray), 459 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with two sprays per nostril of an investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) containing povidone (not the commercially marketed formulation) and 465 patients were treated with 2 sprays of a vehicle nasal spray containing povidone. Nasal septal perforations were reported in one patient treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and 2 patients treated with the vehicle nasal spray. Epistaxis was reported in 19% of patients treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and 12% of patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Somnolence was reported in 3 patients treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) compared to 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. Fatigue was reported in 5 patients treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) compared to 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. In a third 3-arm, 12-month, placebo-controlled, safety trial (vehicle nasal spray), conducted post approval, 1026 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were randomized to treatment with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) (343 patients), a 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray (341 patients), or a 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray (342 patients). All treatments were administered as two sprays per nostril, twice daily. Overall, 5% of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) patients, 2% of 3.7 pH vehicle patients and 3% of 7.0 pH vehicle patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was epistaxis, which occurred in 24% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 20% of patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, and 23% of patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. Epistaxis resulted in the discontinuation of 2 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and 1 patient treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. Nasal septal perforation was reported for one patient treated with the 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulcerations occurred in 9% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 8% of patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, and 9% of patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulceration resulted in the discontinuation of 1 patient treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray). Hyposmia and anosmia were each reported by one patient treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray). Neither somnolence nor weight loss was reported. Depression occurred in 3 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 2 patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, and 3 patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. There were no long-term clinical trials in children below 12 years of age. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most common adverse reactions reported include dizziness, dysgeusia, epistaxis, headache, nasal discomfort, oropharyngeal pain, and somnolence. Additionally, hyposmia and anosmia have been reported with the use of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from postmarketing experience with antihistamines, with similar mechanism of action to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, there are no published human data specific to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray). In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of olopatadine hydrochloride to pregnant rats and rabbits caused a decrease in the number of live fetuses at maternal doses approximately 110 and 1460 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4%, and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an oral embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rabbits were dosed throughout the period of organogenesis at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. A decrease in the number of live fetuses was observed at 400 mg/kg/day (1460 times the MRHDID, on a mg/m 2 basis). In an oral embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rats were dosed throughout the period of organogenesis at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. Maternal toxicity, producing death and reduced maternal body weight gain was observed at 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 1100 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis). Olopatadine produced cleft palate at 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 110 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis) and decreased embryo-fetal viability and reduced fetal weight in rats at 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 1100 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis). In peri-/postnatal toxicity studies, pregnant rats received oral doses of olopatadine up to 600 mg/kg/day during late gestation and throughout the lactation period. Olopatadine produced decreased neonatal survival at 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 110 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis) and reduced body weight gain in pups at 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 7 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis). These effects appeared attributable to exposure of pups via the milk as demonstrated in a cross-fostered study in which pups of untreated dams cross-fostered to dams treated with 60 mg/kg/day olopatadine orally during the lactation period exhibited decreased body weight gain. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of olopatadine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Although orally administered olopatadine is present in rat milk, there is no information about nasally administered olopatadine. It is not known whether topical nasal administration could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human breast milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) and any potential adverse effects on the breast fed infant from olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age are supported by 3 vehicle-controlled 2-week studies in 870 patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Doses studied included one and two sprays per nostril twice daily. One of these studies evaluated the safety of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) at doses of one and two sprays per nostril twice daily in 1,188 patients, of which 298 patients were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) 1 spray and 297 patients were exposed to vehicle 1 spray. In this study, the incidence of epistaxis with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) use was 5.7% [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older are supported by 3 randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 weeks duration in adult and adolescent patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . In these studies, the incidence of epistaxis with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) use in 587 patients was 3.2% [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) have not been established in pediatric patients under 6 years of age. The safety of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) at a dose of one spray per nostril twice daily was evaluated in one 2-week vehicle-controlled study in 132 pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis. In this trial, 66 patients were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray). The most common (greater than 1.0%) adverse reactions reported were diarrhea (9.1%), epistaxis (6.1%), rhinorrhea (4.5%), bitter taste (3.0%) and wheezing (3.0%). Diarrhea was reported more frequently (9.1%) in patients 2 to 5 years of age than 6 to 11 year old age group (< 1%). 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Olopatadine is a histamine H 1 receptor antagonist. The antihistaminic activity of olopatadine has been documented in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a placebo-controlled cardiovascular safety study, 32 healthy volunteers received 20 mg oral solution of olopatadine twice daily for 14 days (8-fold greater daily dose than the recommended daily nasal dose). The mean QTcF (QT corrected by Fridericia\u2019s correction method for heart rate) change from baseline was -2.7 msec and -3.8 msec for olopatadine, and placebo, respectively. In this study, 8 subjects treated with olopatadine had a QTcF change from baseline of 30-60 msec, 1 subject had a QTcF change from baseline greater than 60 msec, and no subjects had QTcF values greater than 500 msec. Eight subjects treated with placebo had a QTcF change from baseline of 30-60 msec, no subjects had a QTcF change from baseline greater than 60 msec, and no subjects had QTcF values greater than 500 msec. In a 12-month study in 429 perennial allergic rhinitis patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) two sprays per nostril twice daily, no evidence of any effect of olopatadine hydrochloride on QT prolongation was observed. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of olopatadine were studied after administration by the nasal, oral, intravenous, and topical ocular routes. Olopatadine exhibited linear pharmacokinetics across the routes studied over a large dose range. Absorption Healthy Subjects: Olopatadine was absorbed with individual peak plasma concentrations observed between 30 minutes and 1 hour after twice daily intranasal administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray). The mean ( \u00b1 SD) steady-state peak plasma concentration (C max ) of olopatadine was 16.0 \u00b1 8.99 ng/mL. Systemic exposure as indexed by area under the curve (AUC 0-12 ) averaged 66.0 \u00b1 26.8 ng\u00b7h/mL. The average absolute bioavailability of intranasal olopatadine is 57%. The mean accumulation ratio following multiple intranasal administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) was about 1.3. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Patients: Systemic exposure of olopatadine in seasonal allergic rhinitis SAR patients after twice daily intranasal administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) was comparable to that observed in healthy subjects. Olopatadine was absorbed with peak plasma concentrations observed between 15 minutes and 2 hours. The mean steady-state C max was 23.3 \u00b1 6.2 ng/mL and AUC 0-12 averaged 78.0 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL. Distribution The protein binding of olopatadine was moderate at approximately 55% in human serum, and independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.1 to 1000 ng/mL. Olopatadine was bound predominately to human serum albumin. Elimination The plasma elimination half-life of olopatadine is 8 to 12 hours. Olopatadine is mainly eliminated through urinary excretion. Approximately 70% of a [ 14 C] olopatadine hydrochloride oral dose was recovered in urine with 17% in the feces. Of the drug-related material recovered within the first 24 hours in the urine, 86% was unchanged olopatadine with the balance comprised of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine. Metabolism Olopatadine is not extensively metabolized. Based on plasma metabolite profiles following oral administration of [ 14 C] olopatadine, at least six minor metabolites circulate in human plasma. Olopatadine accounts for 77% of peak plasma total radioactivity and all metabolites amounted to <6% combined. Two of these have been identified as the olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine. In in vitro studies with cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP) and flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO), N-desmethyl olopatadine (Ml) formation was catalyzed mainly by CYP3A4, while olopatadine N-oxide (M3) was primarily catalyzed by FMO1 and FMO3. Olopatadine at concentrations up to 33,900 ng/mL did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. The potential for olopatadine and its metabolites to act as inducers of CYP enzymes has not been evaluated. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic study examining the effect of hepatic impairment was conducted. Since metabolism of olopatadine is a minor route of elimination, no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) is warranted in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with Renal Impairment The mean C max values for olopatadine following single nasal doses were not markedly different between healthy subjects (18.1 ng/mL) and patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment (range 15.5 to 21.6 ng/mL). The mean plasma AUC 0-12 was 2-fold higher in patients with severe impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). In these patients, peak steady-state plasma concentrations of olopatadine are approximately 10-fold lower than those observed after higher 20 mg oral doses, twice daily, which were well-tolerated. These findings indicate that no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) is warranted in patients with renal impairment. Male and Female Patients The mean systemic exposure (C max and AUC 0-12 ) in female SAR patients following multiple administration of olopatadine was 40% and 27% higher, respectively than those values observed in male SAR patients. Racial or Ethnic Groups The effects of race on olopatadine pharmacokinetics have not been adequately investigated. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine in patients 6 through 11 years of age were characterized using data from 42 pediatric patients administered olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), one spray per nostril twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max (15.4 \u00b1 7.3 ng/mL) of olopatadine was approximately 2-fold less than was comparable to that observed in adults (78.0 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL). The C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide were comparable to that observed in adults. The C max and AUC 0-12 of N-desmethyl olopatadine are approximately 18% and 37% higher than that observed in adults, respectively. Pediatric Patients 2 to 5 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, Olopatadine N-oxide, and N-desmethyl olopatadine were characterized using population pharmacokinetic methods applied to sparse data (approximately 5 samples per patient) obtained from 66 pediatric patients (2 to less than 6 years of age) administered one-half the recommended adult dose (1 spray per nostril) of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine were 13.4 \u00b1 4.6 ng/mL and 75.0 \u00b1 26.4 ng*hr/mL respectively. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine were similar to that of patients 6 to 11 years of age. Drug Interaction Studies Drug interactions with inhibitors of liver enzymes are not anticipated because olopatadine is eliminated predominantly by renal excretion. Olopatadine did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. Based on these data, drug interactions involving P450 inhibition are not expected. Due to the modest protein binding of olopatadine (55%), drug interactions through displacement from plasma proteins are also not expected."

The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine were 13.4 \u00b1 4.6 ng/mL and 75.0 \u00b1 26.4 ng*hr/mL respectively. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine were similar to that of patients 6 to 11 years of age. Drug Interaction Studies Drug interactions with inhibitors of liver enzymes are not anticipated because olopatadine is eliminated predominantly by renal excretion. Olopatadine did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. Based on these data, drug interactions involving P450 inhibition are not expected. Due to the modest protein binding of olopatadine (55%), drug interactions through displacement from plasma proteins are also not expected."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age and Older The efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) were evaluated in 3 randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials (vehicle nasal spray) of 2 weeks duration in adult and adolescent patients, 12 years of age and older with symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. The 3 clinical trials were conducted in the United States and included 1598 patients (556 males, and 1042 females) 12 years of age and older. In these 3 trials, 587 patients were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) 0.6%, 418 patients were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) 0.4%, and 593 patients were treated with vehicle nasal spray. Assessment of efficacy was based on patient recording of 4 individual nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, and sneezing) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) as reflective or instantaneous scores. Reflective scoring required patients to record symptom severity over the previous 12 hours; the instantaneous scoring required patients to record symptom severity at the time of recording. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference from placebo in the percent change from baseline in the average of morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) averaged for the 2-week treatment period. In all 3 trials, patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), two sprays per nostril, twice-daily, exhibited statistically significantly greater decreases in rTNSS compared to vehicle nasal spray. Results for the rTNSS from 2 representative trials are shown in Table 3. Table 3: Mean Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) in Adult and Adolescent Patients With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Study No. Treatment N Baseline Change from Baseline Difference from Placebo Estimate 95% CI p-value Study 1 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray) 0.6% 183 8.71 -3.63 -0.96 (-1.42, -0.51) <0.0001 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray) 0.4% 188 8.90 -3.38 -0.71 (-1.17, -0.26) 0.0023 Vehicle Nasal Spray 191 8.75 -2.67 Study 2 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray) 0.6% 220 9.17 -2.90 -0.98 (-1.37, -0.59) <0.0001 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray) 0.4% 228 9.26 -2.63 -0.72 (-1.11, -0.33) 0.0003 Vehicle Nasal Spray 223 9.07 -1.92 Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval. Itchy eyes and watery eyes were evaluated as secondary endpoints but eye redness was not evaluated. In 2 of the studies, patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) had significantly greater decreases in reflective symptom scores for itchy eyes and watery eyes, compared to vehicle nasal spray. In the 2-week seasonal allergy trials, onset of action was also evaluated by instantaneous TNSS assessments twice-daily after the first dose of study medication. In these trials, onset of action was seen after 1 day of dosing. Onset of action was evaluated in 3 environmental exposure unit studies with single doses of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray). In these studies, patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to high levels of pollen in the environmental exposure unit and then treated with either olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) or vehicle nasal spray, two sprays in each nostril, after which they self-reported their allergy symptoms hourly as instantaneous scores for the subsequent 12 hours. Olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) 0.6% was found to have an onset of action of 30 minutes after dosing in the environmental exposure unit. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age There were 3 clinical trials of 2 weeks duration with olopatadine nasal spray in patients 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Efficacy of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) was evaluated in 2 of the 3 trials. One of the 2 trials that showed efficacy was a randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo (vehicle nasal spray)-controlled clinical trial of 2 weeks duration, including 1188 children ages 6 to < 12 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Assessment of efficacy was based on patient/caregiver recording of 4 individual nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, and sneezing) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) as reflective or instantaneous scores. Reflective scoring captured symptom severity over the previous 12 hours; the instantaneous scoring captured symptom severity at the time of recording. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference from placebo in the percent change from baseline in the average of patient/caregiver-reported morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) averaged for the 2-week treatment period. Patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), one or two sprays per nostril twice daily, had statistically significantly greater decreases in rTNSS compared to vehicle nasal spray. Results for rTNSS are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Mean Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) in Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Treatment N Baseline Change from Baseline Difference from Placebo Estimate 95% CI p-value Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray) 0.6%, one spray per nostril twice daily 294 8.99 -2.24 -0.55 (-0.90, -0.19) 0.0015 Vehicle Nasal Spray, one spray per nostril twice daily 294 9.09 -1.70 Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval. Itchy eyes and watery eyes were evaluated as secondary endpoints in the same study but eye redness was not evaluated.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Epistaxis, Nasal Ulceration, and Nasal Septal Perforation: Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Discontinue if ulcerations or perforations occur. Avoid use in patients with nasal disease other than allergic rhinitis ( 5.1 ). Avoid engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and coordination, such as driving or operating machinery when taking olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray ( 5.2 ). Avoid concurrent use of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray ( 5.2 ). 5.1 Local Nasal Effects Epistaxis and Nasal Ulceration In placebo-controlled clinical trials (vehicle nasal spray) of 2 weeks to 12 months duration, epistaxis and nasal ulcerations were reported [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Nasal Septal Perforation Three placebo-controlled long term (12 months) safety trials (vehicle nasal spray) were conducted. In the first safety trial, patients were treated with an investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray containing povidone (not the commercially marketed formulation) or a vehicle nasal spray containing povidone. Nasal septal perforations were reported in one patient treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 2 patients treated with the vehicle nasal spray. In the second safety trial with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, which does not contain povidone, there were no reports of nasal septal perforation. In the third safety trial, one patient exposed to the 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray (containing no povidone) reported a nasal septal perforation [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Before starting olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, conduct a nasal examination to ensure that patients are free of nasal disease other than allergic rhinitis. Perform nasal examinations periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa and consider stopping olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray if patients develop nasal ulcerations. 5.2 Somnolence and Impaired Mental Alertness In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients taking olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination, such as driving or operating machinery after administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. Concurrent use of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most clinically significant adverse reactions described in other sections of labeling include: Epistaxis, Nasal Ulceration, and Nasal Septal Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Somnolence and Impaired Mental Alertness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] The most common (> 1%) adverse reactions, included bitter taste, headache, epistaxis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, post-nasal drip, cough, and urinary tract infection in patients 12 years of age and older and epistaxis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, bitter taste, pyrexia, and rash in patients 6 to 11 years of age ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below reflect exposure to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray in 2,770 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis in 10 controlled clinical trials of 2 weeks to 12 months duration. Olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray is not indicated for use in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. The safety data from adults and adolescents are based upon 6 placebo-controlled clinical trials (3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray or 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray) in which 1,834 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (652 males and 1,182 females) 12 years of age and older were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily. There were 1,180 patients (olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 587; vehicle nasal spray, 593) that participated in 3 efficacy and safety trials of 2 weeks duration. There were 2,840 patients (olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 1,247; 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, 1,251; 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray, 342) that participated in 3 long-term clinical trials of 1-year duration. The racial distribution of adult and adolescent patients receiving olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was 77% white, 9% black, and 14% other. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in these controlled clinical trials was comparable for olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and vehicle nasal spray. Overall, 4.7% of the 1,834 adult and adolescent patients across all 6 studies treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 3.5% of the 1,844 patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to adverse reactions, and 2.9% of the 342 patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to adverse reactions. The safety data from pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age are based upon 3 clinical trials in which 870 children with seasonal allergic rhinitis (376 females and 494 males) were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray one or two sprays per nostril twice daily for 2 weeks. The racial distribution of pediatric patients receiving olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was 68.6% white, 16.6% black, and 14.8% other. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in these controlled clinical trials was comparable for olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and vehicle nasal spray. Overall, 1.4% of the 870 pediatric patients across all 3 studies treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 1.3% of the 872 pediatric patients treated with vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to adverse reactions. Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older in Short-Term (2 week) Trials There were 1,180 patients 12 years of age and older (olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 587; vehicle nasal spray, 593) that participated in 3 efficacy and safety trials of 2 weeks duration. Table 1 presents the most common adverse reactions (0.9% or greater in patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray that occurred more frequently in patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray compared with vehicle nasal spray in the 3 clinical trials of 2 weeks duration. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 0.9% or Greater in Controlled Clinical Trials of 2 Weeks Duration With Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray in Adolescent and Adult Patients 12 Years of Age and Older With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years and Older Adverse Reaction Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray N = 587 Vehicle Nasal Spray N = 593 Bitter taste 75 (12.8%) 5 (0.8%) Headache 26 (4.4%) 24 (4%) Epistaxis 19 (3.2%) 10 (1.7%) Pharyngolaryngeal Pain 13 (2.2%) 8 (1.3%) Post-nasal drip 9 (1.5%) 5 (0.8%) Cough 8 (1.4%) 3 (0.5%) Urinary tract infection 7 (1.2%) 3 (0.5%) CPK elevation 5 (0.9%) 2 (0.3%) Dry mouth 5 (0.9%) 1 (0.2%) Fatigue 5 (0.9%) 4 (0.7%) Influenza 5 (0.9%) 1 (0.2%) Nasopharyngitis 5 (0.9%) 4 (0.7%) Somnolence 5 (0.9%) 2 (0.3%) Throat irritation 5 (0.9%) 0 (0%) There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender or race. Clinical trials did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age There were 1,742 pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age (olopatadine nasal spray, 870; vehicle nasal spray, 872) with seasonal allergic rhinitis that participated in 3 clinical trials of 2 weeks duration. Two of the studies used the investigational formulation of olopatadine nasal spray, and one of the studies used olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. One study evaluated the safety of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray at doses of one and two sprays per nostril twice daily in 1,188 patients, in which 298 were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 1 spray, 296 were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray (nasal spray) 2 sprays, 297 were exposed to vehicle 1 spray, and 297 were exposed to vehicle 2 sprays twice daily for 2 weeks. Table 2 presents the most common adverse reactions (greater than 1% in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray one spray per nostril) that occurred more frequently with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray compared with vehicle nasal spray. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of Greater Than 1% in a Controlled Clinical Trial of 2 Weeks Duration With Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray in Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age Adverse Reaction Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray One Spray per Nostril N = 298 Vehicle Nasal Spray One Spray per Nostril N = 297 Epistaxis 17 (5.7%) 11 (3.7%) Headache 13 (4.4%) 11 (3.7%) Upper respiratory tract infection 8 (2.6%) 0 Bitter taste 3 (1%) 0 Pyrexia 4 (1.3%) 3 (1%) Rash 4 (1.3%) 0 There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender, race, or ethnicity. Long-Term (12 month) Safety Trials In a 12-month, placebo-controlled, safety trial (vehicle nasal spray), 890 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were randomized to treatment with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily (445 patients) or vehicle nasal spray (445 patients). In the olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and vehicle nasal spray groups, 72% and 74% of patients, respectively, completed the trial. Overall, 7% and 5%, respectively, discontinued study participation due to an adverse reaction. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was epistaxis, which occurred in 25% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 28% in patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Epistaxis resulted in discontinuation of 0.9% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 0.2% of patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulcerations occurred in 10% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 9% of patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulcerations resulted in discontinuation of 0.4% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 0.2% patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. There were no patients with nasal septal perforation in either treatment group. Somnolence was reported in 1 patient treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. Weight increase was reported in 6 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. Depression or worsening of depression occurred in 9 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and in 5 patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Three patients, 2 of whom had preexisting histories of depression, who received olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray were hospitalized for depression compared to none who received vehicle nasal spray. In a second 12-month placebo-controlled, safety trial (vehicle nasal spray), 459 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with two sprays per nostril of an investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray containing povidone (not the commercially marketed formulation) and 465 patients were treated with 2 sprays of a vehicle nasal spray containing povidone. Nasal septal perforations were reported in one patient treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 2 patients treated with the vehicle nasal spray. Epistaxis was reported in 19% of patients treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 12% of patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Somnolence was reported in 3 patients treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray compared to 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. Fatigue was reported in 5 patients treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray compared to 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. In a third 3-arm, 12-month, placebo-controlled, safety trial (vehicle nasal spray), conducted post approval, 1,026 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were randomized to treatment with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray (343 patients), a 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray (341 patients), or a 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray (342 patients). All treatments were administered as two sprays per nostril, twice daily. Overall, 5% of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray patients, 2% of 3.7 pH vehicle patients and 3% of 7.0 pH vehicle patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was epistaxis, which occurred in 24% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 20% of patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, and 23% of patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. Epistaxis resulted in the discontinuation of 2 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 1 patient treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. Nasal septal perforation was reported for one patient treated with the 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulcerations occurred in 9% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 8% of patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, and 9% of patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulceration resulted in the discontinuation of 1 patient treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. Hyposmia and anosmia were each reported by one patient treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. Neither somnolence nor weight loss was reported. Depression occurred in 3 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 2 patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, and 3 patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. There were no long-term clinical trials in children below 12 years of age. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most common adverse reactions reported include dizziness, dysgeusia, epistaxis, headache, nasal discomfort, oropharyngeal pain, and somnolence. Additionally, hyposmia and anosmia have been reported with the use of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from postmarketing experience with antihistamines, with similar mechanism of action to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, there are no published human data specific to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of olopatadine hydrochloride to pregnant rats and rabbits caused a decrease in the number of live fetuses at maternal doses approximately 110 and 1460 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4%, and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an oral embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rabbits were dosed throughout the period of organogenesis at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. A decrease in the number of live fetuses was observed at 400 mg/kg/day (1460 times the MRHDID, on a mg/m 2 basis). In an oral embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rats were dosed throughout the period of organogenesis at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. Maternal toxicity, producing death and reduced maternal body weight gain was observed at 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 1100 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis). Olopatadine produced cleft palate at 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 110 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis) and decreased embryo-fetal viability and reduced fetal weight in rats at 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 1100 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis). In peri-/postnatal toxicity studies, pregnant rats received oral doses of olopatadine up to 600 mg/kg/day during late gestation and throughout the lactation period. Olopatadine produced decreased neonatal survival at 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 110 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis) and reduced body weight gain in pups at 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 7 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis). These effects appeared attributable to exposure of pups via the milk as demonstrated in a cross-fostered study in which pups of untreated dams cross-fostered to dams treated with 60 mg/kg/day olopatadine orally during the lactation period exhibited decreased body weight gain. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of olopatadine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Although orally administered olopatadine is present in rat milk, there is no information about nasally administered olopatadine. It is not known whether topical nasal administration could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human breast milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and any potential adverse effects on the breast fed infant from olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age are supported by 3 vehicle-controlled 2-week studies in 870 patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Doses studied included one and two sprays per nostril twice daily. One of these studies evaluated the safety of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray at doses of one and two sprays per nostril twice daily in 1,188 patients, of which 298 patients were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 1 spray, and 297 patients were exposed to vehicle 1 spray. In this study, the incidence of epistaxis with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray use was 5.7% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older are supported by 3 randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 weeks duration in adult and adolescent patients [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In these studies, the incidence of epistaxis with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray use in 587 patients was 3.2% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray have not been established in pediatric patients under 6 years of age. The safety of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray at a dose of one spray per nostril twice daily was evaluated in one 2-week vehicle-controlled study in 132 pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis. In this trial, 66 patients were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. The most common (greater than 1%) adverse reactions reported were diarrhea (9.1%), epistaxis (6.1%), rhinorrhea (4.5%), bitter taste (3%) and wheezing (3%). Diarrhea was reported more frequently (9.1%) in patients 2 to 5 years of age than 6 to 11 year old age group (< 1%). 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Olopatadine is a histamine H 1 receptor antagonist. The antihistaminic activity of olopatadine has been documented in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a placebo-controlled cardiovascular safety study, 32 healthy volunteers received 20 mg oral spray of olopatadine twice daily for 14 days (8-fold greater daily dose than the recommended daily nasal dose). The mean QTcF (QT corrected by Fridericia's correction method for heart rate) change from baseline was -2.7 msec and -3.8 msec for olopatadine, and placebo, respectively. In this study, 8 subjects treated with olopatadine had a QTcF change from baseline of 30 to 60 msec, 1 subject had a QTcF change from baseline greater than 60 msec, and no subjects had QTcF values greater than 500 msec. Eight subjects treated with placebo had a QTcF change from baseline of 30 to 60 msec, no subjects had a QTcF change from baseline greater than 60 msec, and no subjects had QTcF values greater than 500 msec. In a 12-month study in 429 perennial allergic rhinitis patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily, no evidence of any effect of olopatadine hydrochloride on QT prolongation was observed. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of olopatadine were studied after administration by the nasal, oral, intravenous, and topical ocular routes. Olopatadine exhibited linear pharmacokinetics across the routes studied over a large dose range. Absorption Healthy Subjects: Olopatadine was absorbed with individual peak plasma concentrations observed between 30 minutes and 1 hour after twice daily intranasal administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. The mean (\u00b1 SD) steady-state peak plasma concentration (C max ) of olopatadine was 16 \u00b1 8.99 ng/mL. Systemic exposure as indexed by area under the curve (AUC 0-12 ) averaged 66 \u00b1 26.8 ng\u00b7h/mL. The average absolute bioavailability of intranasal olopatadine is 57%. The mean accumulation ratio following multiple intranasal administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was about 1.3. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Patients: Systemic exposure of olopatadine in seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients after twice daily intranasal administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was comparable to that observed in healthy subjects. Olopatadine was absorbed with peak plasma concentrations observed between 15 minutes and 2 hours. The mean steady-state C max was 23.3 \u00b1 6.2 ng/mL and AUC 0-12 averaged 78 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL. Distribution The protein binding of olopatadine was moderate at approximately 55% in human serum, and independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.1 to 1000 ng/mL. Olopatadine was bound predominately to human serum albumin. Elimination The plasma elimination half-life of olopatadine is 8 to 12 hours. Olopatadine is mainly eliminated through urinary excretion. Approximately 70% of a [ 14 C] olopatadine hydrochloride oral dose was recovered in urine with 17% in the feces. Of the drug-related material recovered within the first 24 hours in the urine, 86% was unchanged olopatadine with the balance comprised of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine. Metabolism Olopatadine is not extensively metabolized. Based on plasma metabolite profiles following oral administration of [ 14 C] olopatadine, at least six minor metabolites circulate in human plasma. Olopatadine accounts for 77% of peak plasma total radioactivity and all metabolites amounted to <6% combined. Two of these have been identified as the olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine. In in vitro studies with cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP) and flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO), N-desmethyl olopatadine (Ml) formation was catalyzed mainly by CYP3A4, while olopatadine N-oxide (M3) was primarily catalyzed by FMO1 and FMO3. Olopatadine at concentrations up to 33,900 ng/mL did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. The potential for olopatadine and its metabolites to act as inducers of CYP enzymes has not been evaluated. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic study examining the effect of hepatic impairment was conducted. Since metabolism of olopatadine is a minor route of elimination, no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray is warranted in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with Renal Impairment The mean C max values for olopatadine following single nasal doses were not markedly different between healthy subjects (18.1 ng/mL) and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (range 15.5 to 21.6 ng/mL). The mean plasma AUC 0-12 was 2-fold higher in patients with severe impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). In these patients, peak steady-state plasma concentrations of olopatadine are approximately 10-fold lower than those observed after higher 20 mg oral doses, twice daily, which were well-tolerated. These findings indicate that no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray is warranted in patients with renal impairment. Male and Female Patients The mean systemic exposure (C max and AUC 0-12 ) in female SAR patients following multiple administration of olopatadine was 40% and 27% higher, respectively than those values observed in male SAR patients. Racial or Ethnic Groups The effects of race on olopatadine pharmacokinetics have not been adequately investigated. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine in patients 6 through 11 years of age were characterized using data from 42 pediatric patients administered olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, one spray per nostril twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max (15.4 \u00b1 7.3 ng/mL) of olopatadine was approximately 2-fold less than was comparable to that observed in adults (78 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL). The C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide were comparable to that observed in adults. The C max and AUC 0-12 of N-desmethyl olopatadine are approximately 18% and 37% higher than that observed in adults, respectively. Pediatric Patients 2 to 5 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide, and N-desmethyl olopatadine were characterized using population pharmacokinetic methods applied to sparse data (approximately 5 samples per patient) obtained from 66 pediatric patients (2 to less than 6 years of age) administered one-half the recommended adult dose (one spray per nostril) of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine were 13.4 \u00b1 4.6 ng/mL and 75 \u00b1 26.4 ng.hr/mL respectively. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine were similar to that of patients 6 to 11 years of age. Drug Interaction Studies Drug interactions with inhibitors of liver enzymes are not anticipated because olopatadine is eliminated predominantly by renal excretion. Olopatadine did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Based on these data, drug interactions involving P450 inhibition are not expected. Due to the modest protein binding of olopatadine (55%), drug interactions through displacement from plasma proteins are also not expected."

In in vitro studies with cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP) and flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO), N-desmethyl olopatadine (Ml) formation was catalyzed mainly by CYP3A4, while olopatadine N-oxide (M3) was primarily catalyzed by FMO1 and FMO3. Olopatadine at concentrations up to 33,900 ng/mL did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. The potential for olopatadine and its metabolites to act as inducers of CYP enzymes has not been evaluated. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic study examining the effect of hepatic impairment was conducted. Since metabolism of olopatadine is a minor route of elimination, no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray is warranted in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with Renal Impairment The mean C max values for olopatadine following single nasal doses were not markedly different between healthy subjects (18.1 ng/mL) and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (range 15.5 to 21.6 ng/mL). The mean plasma AUC 0-12 was 2-fold higher in patients with severe impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). In these patients, peak steady-state plasma concentrations of olopatadine are approximately 10-fold lower than those observed after higher 20 mg oral doses, twice daily, which were well-tolerated. These findings indicate that no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray is warranted in patients with renal impairment. Male and Female Patients The mean systemic exposure (C max and AUC 0-12 ) in female SAR patients following multiple administration of olopatadine was 40% and 27% higher, respectively than those values observed in male SAR patients. Racial or Ethnic Groups The effects of race on olopatadine pharmacokinetics have not been adequately investigated. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine in patients 6 through 11 years of age were characterized using data from 42 pediatric patients administered olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, one spray per nostril twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max (15.4 \u00b1 7.3 ng/mL) of olopatadine was approximately 2-fold less than was comparable to that observed in adults (78 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL). The C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide were comparable to that observed in adults. The C max and AUC 0-12 of N-desmethyl olopatadine are approximately 18% and 37% higher than that observed in adults, respectively. Pediatric Patients 2 to 5 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide, and N-desmethyl olopatadine were characterized using population pharmacokinetic methods applied to sparse data (approximately 5 samples per patient) obtained from 66 pediatric patients (2 to less than 6 years of age) administered one-half the recommended adult dose (one spray per nostril) of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine were 13.4 \u00b1 4.6 ng/mL and 75 \u00b1 26.4 ng.hr/mL respectively. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine were similar to that of patients 6 to 11 years of age. Drug Interaction Studies Drug interactions with inhibitors of liver enzymes are not anticipated because olopatadine is eliminated predominantly by renal excretion. Olopatadine did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Based on these data, drug interactions involving P450 inhibition are not expected. Due to the modest protein binding of olopatadine (55%), drug interactions through displacement from plasma proteins are also not expected."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age and Older The efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray were evaluated in 3 randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials (vehicle nasal spray) of 2 weeks duration in adult and adolescent patients, 12 years of age and older with symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. The 3 clinical trials were conducted in the United States and included 1,598 patients (556 males, and 1,042 females) 12 years of age and older. In these 3 trials, 587 patients were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 0.6%, 418 patients were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 0.4% and 593 patients were treated with vehicle nasal spray. Assessment of efficacy was based on patient recording of 4 individual nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, and sneezing) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) as reflective or instantaneous scores. Reflective scoring required patients to record symptom severity over the previous 12 hours; the instantaneous scoring required patients to record symptom severity at the time of recording. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference from placebo in the percent change from baseline in the average of morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) averaged for the 2-week treatment period. In all 3 trials, patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, two sprays per nostril, twice-daily, exhibited statistically significantly greater decreases in rTNSS compared to vehicle nasal spray. Results for the rTNSS from 2 representative trials are shown in Table 3. Table 3: Mean Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) in Adult and Adolescent Patients With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Change From Difference From Placebo Study No. Treatment N Baseline Baseline Estimate 95% CI p-value Study 1 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.6% 183 8.71 -3.63 -0.96 (-1.42, -0.51) <0.0001 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.4% 188 8.90 -3.38 -0.71 (-1.17, -0.26) 0.0023 Vehicle Nasal Spray 191 8.75 -2.67 Study 2 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.6% 220 9.17 -2.90 -0.98 (-1.37, -0.59) <0.0001 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.4% 228 9.26 -2.63 -0.72 (-1.11, -0.33) 0.0003 Vehicle Nasal Spray 223 9.07 -1.92 Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval. Itchy eyes and watery eyes were evaluated as secondary endpoints but eye redness was not evaluated. In 2 of the studies, patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray had significantly greater decreases in reflective symptom scores for itchy eyes and watery eyes, compared to vehicle nasal spray. In the 2-week seasonal allergy trials, onset of action was also evaluated by instantaneous TNSS assessments twice-daily after the first dose of study medication. In these trials, onset of action was seen after 1 day of dosing. Onset of action was evaluated in 3 environmental exposure unit studies with single doses of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. In these studies, patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to high levels of pollen in the environmental exposure unit and then treated with either olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray or vehicle nasal spray, two sprays in each nostril, after which they self-reported their allergy symptoms hourly as instantaneous scores for the subsequent 12 hours. Olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 0.6% was found to have an onset of action of 30 minutes after dosing in the environmental exposure unit. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age There were 3 clinical trials of 2 weeks duration with olopatadine nasal spray in patients 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Efficacy of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was evaluated in 2 of the 3 trials. One of the 2 trials that showed efficacy was a randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo (vehicle nasal spray)-controlled clinical trial of 2 weeks duration, including 1,188 children ages 6 to < 12 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Assessment of efficacy was based on patient/caregiver recording of 4 individual nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, and sneezing) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) as reflective or instantaneous scores. Reflective scoring captured symptom severity over the previous 12 hours; the instantaneous scoring captured symptom severity at the time of recording. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference from placebo in the percent change from baseline in the average of patient/caregiver-reported morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) averaged for the 2-week treatment period. Patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, one or two sprays per nostril twice daily, had statistically significantly greater decreases in rTNSS compared to vehicle nasal spray. Results for rTNSS are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Mean Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score in Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Change From Difference from Placebo Treatment N Baseline Baseline Estimate 95% CI p-value Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.6%, one spray per nostril twice daily 294 8.99 - 2.24 -0.55 (-0.90, -0.19) 0.0015 Vehicle Nasal Spray, one spray per nostril twice daily 294 9.09 -1.70 Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval.

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Olopatadine Hydrochloride (OH-loe-PA-ta-deen HYE-droe-KLOR-ide) nasal spray, for intranasal use This Instructions for Use contains information on how to use olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. Read this Instructions for Use that comes with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray before you start using it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray is for use in your nose only. Do not spray olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray in your eyes or mouth. Important information you need to know before using olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray Use olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray exactly how your healthcare provider tells you to use it. Your olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray bottle must be shaken and primed before you use it for the first time and when you have not used it for more than 7 days. Throw away olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray after 240 sprays after the first priming. Even though the bottle may not be completely empty, you may not get the correct dose of medicine if you continue to use it. Using olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray Step 1. Remove the plastic cap (see Figure A ). Figure A Step 2. Hold the bottle and press down on the shoulders of the nasal applicator with your forefinger and middle finger. Support the bottom of the bottle with your thumb (see Figure B ). Prime the bottle by pressing and releasing the shoulders of the bottle down firmly 5 times or until you see a fine mist come out of the nasal applicator. Now your pump is primed and ready to use. If you do not use olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray for more than 7 days, you will need to prime the bottle again by pressing and releasing the shoulders of the bottle down firmly 2 times or until you see a fine mist come out of the nasal applicator. Figure B Step 3 . Gently blow your nose to clear your nostrils. Hold 1 nostril closed with a finger. Tilt your head down (chin toward chest) and insert the nasal applicator into a nostril. Hold the bottle upright with the nasal applicator tip pointing away from the center of the nose (see Figure C ). Step 4 . Breathe in gently through your nose. While breathing in, press firmly and quickly on the nasal applicator shoulders to release the spray into your nostril (see Figure C ). Figure C Step 5. Breathe out through your mouth. Do not tilt your head back or blow your nose right after using olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. This may cause you to get a bitter taste in your mouth. Step 6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 above to deliver a spray in your other nostril. Step 7 . If your healthcare provider tells you to use 2 sprays in each nostril, repeat Steps 3 through 5 for the second spray in each nostril. Step 8. Wipe the nasal applicator with a clean tissue and replace the plastic cap (see Figure D ). Figure D Cleaning the olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray nasal applicator Step 9. To clean the nasal applicator, remove the plastic cap (see Figure E ). If the nasal applicator becomes clogged, do not try to clear it using a pointed object. Figure E Step 10. Gently pull the nasal applicator up to remove it from the bottle (see Figure F ). Figure F Step 11. With the nasal applicator pointing downwards, wash it by running warm tap water into the nasal applicator for about 1 minute (see Figure G ). Step 12. Shake the nasal applicator to remove any water and put the nasal applicator back on the bottle. Step 13. Prime the bottle again by pressing the shoulders of the bottle down firmly and releasing the shoulders 2 times or until you see a fine mist come out of the white nasal applicator. Repeat Steps 11 and 12 above if the nasal applicator is still clogged. Figure G How should I store olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray ? Store olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray at room temperature between 39\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F (4\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C).

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Olopatadine is an inhibitor of the release of histamine from the mast cell and a relatively selective histamine H 1 -antagonist that inhibits the in vivo and in vitro type 1 immediate hypersensitivity reaction including inhibition of histamine induced effects on human conjunctival epithelial cells. Olopatadine is devoid of effects on alpha-adrenergic, dopamine and muscarinic type 1 and 2 receptors. Following topical ocular administration in man, olopatadine was shown to have low systemic exposure. Two studies in normal volunteers (totaling 24 subjects) dosed bilaterally with olopatadine 0.15% ophthalmic solution once every 12 hours for 2 weeks demonstrated plasma concentrations to be generally below the quantitation limit of the assay (<0.5 ng/mL). Samples in which olopatadine was quantifiable were typically found within 2 hours of dosing and ranged from 0.5 to 1.3 ng/mL. The half-life in plasma was approximately 3 hours, and elimination was predominantly through renal excretion. Approximately 60-70% of the dose was recovered in the urine as parent drug. Two metabolites, the mono-desmethyl and the N-oxide, were detected at low concentrations in the urine. Results from an environmental study demonstrated that olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution USP, 0.1% was effective in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis when dosed twice daily for up to 6 weeks. Results from conjunctival antigen challenge studies demonstrated that Olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution USP, 0.1% when subjects were challenged with antigen both initially and up to 8 hours after dosing, was significantly more effective than its vehicle in preventing ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS To prevent contaminating the dropper tip and solution, care should be taken not to touch the eyelids or surrounding areas with the dropper tip of the bottle. Keep bottle tightly closed when not in use. Patients should be advised not to wear a contact lens if their eye is red. Olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution USP, 0.1% should not be used to treat contact lens related irritation. The preservative in Olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution USP, 0.1%, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Patients who wear soft contact lenses and whose eyes are not red should be instructed to wait at least ten minutes after instilling Olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution USP, 0.1% before they insert their contact lenses. CARCINOGENESIS AND MUTAGENESIS AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Olopatadine administered orally was not carcinogenic in mice and rats in doses up to 500 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively. Based on a 40 \u03bcL drop size, these doses were 78,125 and 31,250 times higher than the maximum recommended ocular human dose (MROHD). No mutagenic potential was observed when olopatadine was tested in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test, an in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration assay or an in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Olopatadine administered to male and female rats at oral doses of 62,500 times MROHD level resulted in a slight decrease in the fertility index and reduced implantation rate; no effects on reproductive function were observed at doses of 7,800 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level. PREGNANCY Pregnancy Category C. Olopatadine was found not to be teratogenic in rats and rabbits. However, rats treated at 600 mg/kg/day, or 93,750 times the MROHD and rabbits treated at 400 mg/kg/day, or 62,500 times the MROHD, during organogenesis showed a decrease in live fetuses. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human responses, this drug should be used in pregnant women only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the embryo or fetus. NURSING MOTHERS Olopatadine has been identified in the milk of nursing rats following oral administration. It is not known whether topical ocular administration could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in the human breast milk. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when Olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution USP, 0.1% is administered to a nursing mother. PEDIATRIC USE Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 3 years have not been established. GERIATRIC USE No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Epistaxis, Nasal Ulceration, and Nasal Septal Perforation: Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Discontinue if ulcerations or perforations occur. Avoid use in patients with nasal disease other than allergic rhinitis (5.1) . Avoid engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and coordination, such as driving or operating machinery when taking olopatadine HCl (5.2) . Avoid concurrent use of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants with olopatadine HCl (5.2) . 5.1 Local Nasal Effects Epistaxis and Nasal Ulceration In placebo-controlled clinical trials (vehicle nasal spray) of 2 weeks to 12 months duration, epistaxis and nasal ulcerations were reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Nasal Septal Perforation Three placebo-controlled long term (12 months) safety trials (vehicle nasal spray) were conducted. In the first safety trial, patients were treated with an investigational formulation of olopatadine HCl containing povidone (not the commercially marketed formulation) or a vehicle nasal spray containing povidone. Nasal septal perforations were reported in one patient treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine HCl and 2 patients treated with the vehicle nasal spray. In the second safety trial with olopatadine HCl, which does not contain povidone, there were no reports of nasal septal perforation. In the third safety trial, one patient exposed to the 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray (containing no povidone) reported a nasal septal perforation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Before starting olopatadine HCl, conduct a nasal examination to ensure that patients are free of nasal disease other than allergic rhinitis. Perform nasal examinations periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa and consider stopping olopatadine HCl if patients develop nasal ulcerations. 5.2 Somnolence and Impaired Mental Alertness In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients taking olopatadine HCl [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination, such as driving or operating machinery after administration of olopatadine HCl. Concurrent use of olopatadine HCl with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most clinically significant adverse reactions described in other sections of labeling include: Epistaxis, Nasal Ulceration, and Nasal Septal Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Somnolence and Impaired Mental Alertness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] The most common (> 1%) adverse reactions, included bitter taste, headache, epistaxis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, post-nasal drip, cough, and urinary tract infection in patients 12 years of age and older and epistaxis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, bitter taste, pyrexia, and rash in patients 6 to 11 years of age (6.1) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals, at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below reflect exposure to olopatadine HCl in 2,770 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis in 10 controlled clinical trials of 2 weeks to 12 months duration. Olopatadine HCl is not indicated for use in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. The safety data from adults and adolescents are based upon 6 placebo-controlled clinical trials (3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray or 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray) in which 1,834 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (652 males and 1,182 females) 12 years of age and older were treated with olopatadine HCl two sprays per nostril twice daily. There were 1,180 patients (olopatadine HCl, 587; vehicle nasal spray, 593) that participated in 3 efficacy and safety trials of 2 weeks duration. There were 2,840 patients (olopatadine HCl, 1,247; 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, 1,251; 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray, 342) that participated in 3 long-term clinical trials of 1-year duration. The racial distribution of adult and adolescent patients receiving olopatadine HCl was 77% white, 9% black, and 14% other. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in these controlled clinical trials was comparable for olopatadine HCl and vehicle nasal spray. Overall, 4.7% of the 1,834 adult and adolescent patients across all 6 studies treated with olopatadine HCl, 3.5% of the 1,844 patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to adverse reactions, and 2.9% of the 342 patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to adverse reactions. The safety data from pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age are based upon 3 clinical trials in which 870 children with seasonal allergic rhinitis (376 females and 494 males) were treated with olopatadine HCl one or two sprays per nostril twice daily for 2 weeks. The racial distribution of pediatric patients receiving olopatadine HCl was 68.6% white, 16.6% black, and 14.8% other. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in these controlled clinical trials was comparable for olopatadine HCl and vehicle nasal spray. Overall, 1.4% of the 870 pediatric patients across all 3 studies treated with olopatadine HCl and 1.3% of the 872 pediatric patients treated with vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to adverse reactions. Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older in Short-Term (2 week) Trials There were 1,180 patients 12 years of age and older (olopatadine HCl, 587; vehicle nasal spray, 593) that participated in 3 efficacy and safety trials of 2 weeks duration. Table 1 presents the most common adverse reactions (0.9% or greater in patients treated with olopatadine HCl) that occurred more frequently in patients treated with olopatadine HCl compared with vehicle nasal spray in the 3 clinical trials of 2 weeks duration. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 0.9% or Greater in Controlled Clinical Trials of 2 Weeks Duration With Olopatadine HCl in Adolescent and Adult Patients 12 Years of Age and Older With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Reaction Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years and Older Olopatadine HCl N = 587 Vehicle Nasal Spray N = 593 Bitter taste 75 (12.8%) 5 (0.8%) Headache 26 (4.4%) 24 (4.0%) Epistaxis 19 (3.2%) 10 (1.7%) Pharyngolaryngeal Pain 13 (2.2%) 8 (1.3%) Post-nasal drip 9 (1.5%) 5 (0.8%) Cough 8 (1.4%) 3 (0.5%) Urinary tract infection 7 (1.2%) 3 (0.5%) CPK elevation 5 (0.9%) 2 (0.3%) Dry mouth 5 (0.9%) 1 (0.2%) Fatigue 5 (0.9%) 4 (0.7%) Influenza 5 (0.9%) 1 (0.2%) Nasopharyngitis 5 (0.9%) 4 (0.7%) Somnolence 5 (0.9%) 2 (0.3%) Throat irritation 5 (0.9%) 0 (0.0%) There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender or race. Clinical trials did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age There were 1,742 pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age (olopatadine nasal spray, 870; vehicle nasal spray, 872) with seasonal allergic rhinitis that participated in 3 clinical trials of 2 weeks duration. Two of the studies used the investigational formulation of olopatadine nasal spray, and one of the studies used olopatadine HCl. One study evaluated the safety of olopatadine HCl at doses of one and two sprays per nostril twice daily in 1,188 patients, in which 298 were exposed to olopatadine HCl 1 spray, 296 were exposed to olopatadine HCl 2 sprays, 297 were exposed to vehicle 1 spray, and 297 were exposed to vehicle 2 sprays twice daily for 2 weeks. Table 2 presents the most common adverse reactions (greater than 1.0% in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age treated with olopatadine HCl one spray per nostril) that occurred more frequently with olopatadine HCl compared with vehicle nasal spray. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of Greater Than 1.0% in a Controlled Clinical Trial of 2 Weeks Duration With Olopatadine HCl in Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Reaction Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age Olopatadine HCl One Spray per Nostril N = 298 Vehicle Nasal Spray One Spray per Nostril N = 297 Epistaxis 17 (5.7%) 11 (3.7%) Headache 13 (4.4%) 11 (3.7%) Upper respiratory tract infection 8 (2.6%) 0 Bitter taste 3 (1.0%) 0 Pyrexia 4 (1.3%) 3 (1.0%) Rash 4 (1.3%) 0 There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender, race, or ethnicity. Long-Term (12 month) Safety Trials In a 12-month, placebo-controlled, safety trial (vehicle nasal spray), 890 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were randomized to treatment with olopatadine HCl two sprays per nostril twice daily (445 patients) or vehicle nasal spray (445 patients). In the olopatadine HCl and vehicle nasal spray groups, 72% and 74% of patients, respectively, completed the trial. Overall, 7% and 5%, respectively, discontinued study participation due to an adverse reaction. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was epistaxis, which occurred in 25% of patients treated with olopatadine HCl and 28% in patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Epistaxis resulted in discontinuation of 0.9% of patients treated with olopatadine HCl and 0.2% of patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulcerations occurred in 10% of patients treated with olopatadine HCl and 9% of patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulcerations resulted in discontinuation of 0.4% of patients treated with olopatadine HCl and 0.2% patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. There were no patients with nasal septal perforation in either treatment group. Somnolence was reported in 1 patient treated with olopatadine HCl and 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. Weight increase was reported in 6 patients treated with olopatadine HCl and 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. Depression or worsening of depression occurred in 9 patients treated with olopatadine HCl and in 5 patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Three patients, 2 of whom had preexisting histories of depression, who received olopatadine HCl were hospitalized for depression compared to none who received vehicle nasal spray. In a second 12-month, placebo-controlled, safety trial (vehicle nasal spray), 459 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with two sprays per nostril of an investigational formulation of olopatadine HCl containing povidone (not the commercially marketed formulation) and 465 patients were treated with 2 sprays of a vehicle nasal spray containing povidone. Nasal septal perforations were reported in one patient treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine HCl and 2 patients treated with the vehicle nasal spray. Epistaxis was reported in 19% of patients treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine HCl and 12% of patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Somnolence was reported in 3 patients treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine HCl compared to 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. Fatigue was reported in 5 patients treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine HCl compared to 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. In a third 3-arm, 12-month placebo-controlled, safety trial (vehicle nasal spray), conducted post approval, 1,026 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were randomized to treatment with olopatadine HCl (343 patients), a 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray (341 patients), or a 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray (342 patients). All treatments were administered as two sprays per nostril, twice daily. Overall, 5% of olopatadine HCl patients, 2% of 3.7 pH vehicle patients and 3% of 7.0 pH vehicle patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was epistaxis, which occurred in 24% of patients treated with olopatadine HCl, 20% of patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, and 23% of patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. Epistaxis resulted in the discontinuation of 2 patients treated with olopatadine HCl and 1 patient treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. Nasal septal perforation was reported for one patient treated with the 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulcerations occurred in 9% of patients treated with olopatadine HCl, 8% of patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, and 9% of patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulceration resulted in the discontinuation of 1 patient treated with olopatadine HCl. Hyposmia and anosmia were each reported by one patient treated with olopatadine HCl. Neither somnolence nor weight loss was reported. Depression occurred in 3 patients treated with olopatadine HCl, 2 patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, and 3 patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. There were no long-term clinical trials in children below 12 years of age. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of olopatadine HCl, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most common adverse reactions reported include dizziness, dysgeusia, epistaxis, headache, nasal discomfort, oropharyngeal pain, and somnolence. Additionally, hyposmia and anosmia have been reported with the use of olopatadine HCl."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from postmarketing experience with antihistamines, with similar mechanism of action to olopatadine HCl, have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, there are no published human data specific to olopatadine HCl. In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of olopatadine hydrochloride to pregnant rats and rabbits caused a decrease in the number of live fetuses at maternal doses approximately 110 and 1,460 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4%, and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an oral embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rabbits were dosed throughout the period of organogenesis at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. A decrease in the number of live fetuses was observed at 400 mg/kg/day (1,460 times the MRHDID, on a mg/m 2 basis). In an oral embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rats were dosed throughout the period of organogenesis at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. Maternal toxicity, producing death and reduced maternal body weight gain was observed at 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 1,100 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis). Olopatadine produced cleft palate at 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 110 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis) and decreased embryo-fetal viability and reduced fetal weight in rats at 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 1,100 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis). In peri-/postnatal toxicity studies, pregnant rats received oral doses of olopatadine up to 600 mg/kg/day during late gestation and throughout the lactation period. Olopatadine produced decreased neonatal survival at 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 110 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis) and reduced body weight gain in pups at 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 7 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis). These effects appeared attributable to exposure of pups via the milk as demonstrated in a cross-fostered study in which pups of untreated dams cross-fostered to dams treated with 60 mg/kg/day olopatadine orally during the lactation period exhibited decreased body weight gain. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of olopatadine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Although orally administered olopatadine is present in rat milk, there is no information about nasally administered olopatadine. It is not known whether topical nasal administration could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human breast milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for olopatadine HCl and any potential adverse effects on the breast fed infant from olopatadine HCl or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine HCl for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine HCl in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age are supported by 3 vehicle-controlled 2-week studies in 870 patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Doses studied included one and two sprays per nostril twice daily. One of these studies evaluated the safety of olopatadine HCl at doses of one and two sprays per nostril twice daily in 1,188 patients, of which 298 patients were exposed to olopatadine HCl 1 spray, and 297 patients were exposed to vehicle 1 spray. In this study, the incidence of epistaxis with olopatadine HCl use was 5.7% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Studies (14) ] . The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine HCl in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older are supported by 3 randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 weeks duration in adult and adolescent patients [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . In these studies, the incidence of epistaxis with olopatadine HCl use in 587 patients was 3.2% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine HCl have not been established in pediatric patients under 6 years of age. The safety of olopatadine HCl at a dose of one spray per nostril twice daily was evaluated in one 2-week vehicle-controlled study in 132 pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis. In this trial, 66 patients were exposed to olopatadine HCl. The most common (greater than 1.0%) adverse reactions reported were diarrhea (9.1%), epistaxis (6.1%), rhinorrhea (4.5%), bitter taste (3.0%), and wheezing (3.0%). Diarrhea was reported more frequently (9.1%) in patients 2 to 5 years of age than 6 to 11 year old age group (< 1%). 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of olopatadine HCl did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Olopatadine is a histamine H 1 receptor antagonist. The antihistaminic activity of olopatadine has been documented in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a placebo-controlled cardiovascular safety study, 32 healthy volunteers received 20 mg oral solution of olopatadine twice daily for 14 days (8-fold greater daily dose than the recommended daily nasal dose). The mean QTcF (QT corrected by Fridericia\u2019s correction method for heart rate) change from baseline was -2.7 msec and -3.8 msec for olopatadine, and placebo, respectively. In this study, 8 subjects treated with olopatadine had a QTcF change from baseline of 30 to 60 msec, 1 subject had a QTcF change from baseline greater than 60 msec, and no subjects had QTcF values greater than 500 msec. Eight subjects treated with placebo had a QTcF change from baseline of 30 to 60 msec, no subjects had a QTcF change from baseline greater than 60 msec, and no subjects had QTcF values greater than 500 msec. In a 12-month study in 429 perennial allergic rhinitis patients treated with olopatadine HCl two sprays per nostril twice daily, no evidence of any effect of olopatadine hydrochloride on QT prolongation was observed. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of olopatadine were studied after administration by the nasal, oral, intravenous, and topical ocular routes. Olopatadine exhibited linear pharmacokinetics across the routes studied over a large dose range. Absorption Healthy Subjects: Olopatadine was absorbed with individual peak plasma concentrations observed between 30 minutes and 1 hour after twice daily intranasal administration of olopatadine HCl. The mean (\u00b1 SD) steady-state peak plasma concentration (C max ) of olopatadine was 16.0 \u00b1 8.99 ng/mL. Systemic exposure as indexed by area under the curve (AUC 0-12 ) averaged 66.0 \u00b1 26.8 ng\u00b7h/mL. The average absolute bioavailability of intranasal olopatadine is 57%. The mean accumulation ratio following multiple intranasal administration of olopatadine HCl was about 1.3. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Patients: Systemic exposure of olopatadine in seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients after twice daily intranasal administration of olopatadine HCl was comparable to that observed in healthy subjects. Olopatadine was absorbed with peak plasma concentrations observed between 15 minutes and 2 hours. The mean steady-state C max was 23.3 \u00b1 6.2 ng/mL and AUC 0-12 averaged 78.0 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL. Distribution The protein binding of olopatadine was moderate at approximately 55% in human serum, and independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.1 to 1,000 ng/mL. Olopatadine was bound predominately to human serum albumin. Elimination The plasma elimination half-life of olopatadine is 8 to 12 hours. Olopatadine is mainly eliminated through urinary excretion. Approximately 70% of a [ 14 C] olopatadine hydrochloride oral dose was recovered in urine with 17% in the feces. Of the drug-related material recovered within the first 24 hours in the urine, 86% was unchanged olopatadine with the balance comprised of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine. Metabolism Olopatadine is not extensively metabolized. Based on plasma metabolite profiles following oral administration of [ 14 C] olopatadine, at least six minor metabolites circulate in human plasma. Olopatadine accounts for 77% of peak plasma total radioactivity and all metabolites amounted to < 6% combined. Two of these have been identified as the olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine. In in vitro studies with cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP) and flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO), N-desmethyl olopatadine (Ml) formation was catalyzed mainly by CYP3A4, while olopatadine N-oxide (M3) was primarily catalyzed by FMO1 and FMO3. Olopatadine at concentrations up to 33,900 ng/mL did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. The potential for olopatadine and its metabolites to act as inducers of CYP enzymes has not been evaluated. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic study examining the effect of hepatic impairment was conducted. Since metabolism of olopatadine is a minor route of elimination, no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine HCl is warranted in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with Renal Impairment The mean C max values for olopatadine following single nasal doses were not markedly different between healthy subjects (18.1 ng/mL) and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (range 15.5 to 21.6 ng/mL). The mean plasma AUC 0-12 was 2-fold higher in patients with severe impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). In these patients, peak steady-state plasma concentrations of olopatadine are approximately 10-fold lower than those observed after higher 20 mg oral doses, twice daily, which were well-tolerated. These findings indicate that no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine HCl is warranted in patients with renal impairment. Male and Female Patients The mean systemic exposure (C max and AUC 0-12 ) in female SAR patients following multiple administration of olopatadine was 40% and 27% higher, respectively than those values observed in male SAR patients. Racial or Ethnic Groups The effects of race on olopatadine pharmacokinetics have not been adequately investigated. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine in patients 6 through 11 years of age were characterized using data from 42 pediatric patients administered olopatadine HCl, one spray per nostril twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max (15.4 \u00b1 7.3 ng/mL) of olopatadine was approximately 2-fold less than was comparable to that observed in adults (78.0 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL). The C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide were comparable to that observed in adults. The C max and AUC 0-12 of N-desmethyl olopatadine are approximately 18% and 37% higher than that observed in adults, respectively. Pediatric Patients 2 to 5 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide, and N-desmethyl olopatadine were characterized using population pharmacokinetic methods applied to sparse data (approximately 5 samples per patient) obtained from 66 pediatric patients (2 to less than 6 years of age) administered one-half the recommended adult dose (one spray per nostril) of olopatadine HCl twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine were 13.4 \u00b1 4.6 ng/mL and 75.0 \u00b1 26.4 ng\u00b7hr/mL respectively. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine were similar to that of patients 6 to 11 years of age. Drug Interaction Studies Drug interactions with inhibitors of liver enzymes are not anticipated because olopatadine is eliminated predominantly by renal excretion. Olopatadine did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Based on these data, drug interactions involving P450 inhibition are not expected. Due to the modest protein binding of olopatadine (55%), drug interactions through displacement from plasma proteins are also not expected."

The mean accumulation ratio following multiple intranasal administration of olopatadine HCl was about 1.3. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Patients: Systemic exposure of olopatadine in seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients after twice daily intranasal administration of olopatadine HCl was comparable to that observed in healthy subjects. Olopatadine was absorbed with peak plasma concentrations observed between 15 minutes and 2 hours. The mean steady-state C max was 23.3 \u00b1 6.2 ng/mL and AUC 0-12 averaged 78.0 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL. Distribution The protein binding of olopatadine was moderate at approximately 55% in human serum, and independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.1 to 1,000 ng/mL. Olopatadine was bound predominately to human serum albumin. Elimination The plasma elimination half-life of olopatadine is 8 to 12 hours. Olopatadine is mainly eliminated through urinary excretion. Approximately 70% of a [ 14 C] olopatadine hydrochloride oral dose was recovered in urine with 17% in the feces. Of the drug-related material recovered within the first 24 hours in the urine, 86% was unchanged olopatadine with the balance comprised of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine. Metabolism Olopatadine is not extensively metabolized. Based on plasma metabolite profiles following oral administration of [ 14 C] olopatadine, at least six minor metabolites circulate in human plasma. Olopatadine accounts for 77% of peak plasma total radioactivity and all metabolites amounted to < 6% combined. Two of these have been identified as the olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine. In in vitro studies with cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP) and flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO), N-desmethyl olopatadine (Ml) formation was catalyzed mainly by CYP3A4, while olopatadine N-oxide (M3) was primarily catalyzed by FMO1 and FMO3. Olopatadine at concentrations up to 33,900 ng/mL did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. The potential for olopatadine and its metabolites to act as inducers of CYP enzymes has not been evaluated. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic study examining the effect of hepatic impairment was conducted. Since metabolism of olopatadine is a minor route of elimination, no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine HCl is warranted in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with Renal Impairment The mean C max values for olopatadine following single nasal doses were not markedly different between healthy subjects (18.1 ng/mL) and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (range 15.5 to 21.6 ng/mL). The mean plasma AUC 0-12 was 2-fold higher in patients with severe impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). In these patients, peak steady-state plasma concentrations of olopatadine are approximately 10-fold lower than those observed after higher 20 mg oral doses, twice daily, which were well-tolerated. These findings indicate that no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine HCl is warranted in patients with renal impairment. Male and Female Patients The mean systemic exposure (C max and AUC 0-12 ) in female SAR patients following multiple administration of olopatadine was 40% and 27% higher, respectively than those values observed in male SAR patients. Racial or Ethnic Groups The effects of race on olopatadine pharmacokinetics have not been adequately investigated. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine in patients 6 through 11 years of age were characterized using data from 42 pediatric patients administered olopatadine HCl, one spray per nostril twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max (15.4 \u00b1 7.3 ng/mL) of olopatadine was approximately 2-fold less than was comparable to that observed in adults (78.0 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL). The C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide were comparable to that observed in adults. The C max and AUC 0-12 of N-desmethyl olopatadine are approximately 18% and 37% higher than that observed in adults, respectively. Pediatric Patients 2 to 5 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide, and N-desmethyl olopatadine were characterized using population pharmacokinetic methods applied to sparse data (approximately 5 samples per patient) obtained from 66 pediatric patients (2 to less than 6 years of age) administered one-half the recommended adult dose (one spray per nostril) of olopatadine HCl twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine were 13.4 \u00b1 4.6 ng/mL and 75.0 \u00b1 26.4 ng\u00b7hr/mL respectively. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine were similar to that of patients 6 to 11 years of age. Drug Interaction Studies Drug interactions with inhibitors of liver enzymes are not anticipated because olopatadine is eliminated predominantly by renal excretion. Olopatadine did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Based on these data, drug interactions involving P450 inhibition are not expected. Due to the modest protein binding of olopatadine (55%), drug interactions through displacement from plasma proteins are also not expected."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age and Older The efficacy and safety of olopatadine HCl were evaluated in 3 randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials (vehicle nasal spray) of 2 weeks duration in adult and adolescent patients, 12 years of age and older with symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. The 3 clinical trials were conducted in the United States and included 1,598 patients (556 males, and 1042 females) 12 years of age and older. In these 3 trials, 587 patients were treated with olopatadine HCl 0.6%, 418 patients were treated with olopatadine HCl 0.4%, and 593 patients were treated with vehicle nasal spray. Assessment of efficacy was based on patient recording of 4 individual nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, and sneezing) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) as reflective or instantaneous scores. Reflective scoring required patients to record symptom severity over the previous 12 hours; the instantaneous scoring required patients to record symptom severity at the time of recording. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference from placebo in the percent change from baseline in the average of morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) averaged for the 2-week treatment period. In all 3 trials, patients treated with olopatadine HCl, two sprays per nostril, twice-daily, exhibited statistically significantly greater decreases in rTNSS compared to vehicle nasal spray. Results for the rTNSS from 2 representative trials are shown in Table 3.

Itchy eyes and watery eyes were evaluated as secondary endpoints but eye redness was not evaluated. In 2 of the studies, patients treated with olopatadine HCl had significantly greater decreases in reflective symptom scores for itchy eyes and watery eyes, compared to vehicle nasal spray. In the 2-week seasonal allergy trials, onset of action was also evaluated by instantaneous TNSS assessments twice-daily after the first dose of study medication. In these trials, onset of action was seen after 1 day of dosing. Onset of action was evaluated in 3 environmental exposure unit studies with single doses of olopatadine HCl. In these studies, patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to high levels of pollen in the environmental exposure unit and then treated with either olopatadine HCl or vehicle nasal spray, two sprays in each nostril, after which they self-reported their allergy symptoms hourly as instantaneous scores for the subsequent 12 hours. Olopatadine HCl 0.6% was found to have an onset of action of 30 minutes after dosing in the environmental exposure unit. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age There were 3 clinical trials of 2 weeks duration with olopatadine nasal spray in patients 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Efficacy of olopatadine HCl was evaluated in 2 of the 3 trials. One of the 2 trials that showed efficacy was a randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo (vehicle nasal spray)-controlled clinical trial of 2 weeks duration, including 1,188 children ages 6 to < 12 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Assessment of efficacy was based on patient/caregiver recording of 4 individual nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, and sneezing) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) as reflective or instantaneous scores. Reflective scoring captured symptom severity over the previous 12 hours; the instantaneous scoring captured symptom severity at the time of recording. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference from placebo in the percent change from baseline in the average of patient/caregiver-reported morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) averaged for the 2-week treatment period. Patients treated with olopatadine HCl, one or two sprays per nostril twice daily, had statistically significantly greater decreases in rTNSS compared to vehicle nasal spray. Results for rTNSS are shown in Table 4.

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Olopatadine Hydrochloride (oh\u201d loe pat\u2019 a deen hye\u201d droe klor\u2019 ide) Nasal Spray, for intranasal use This Instructions for Use contains information on how to use olopatadine HCl nasal spray. Read this Instructions for Use that comes with olopatadine HCl nasal spray before you start using it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Olopatadine HCl nasal spray is for use in your nose only. Do not spray olopatadine HCl nasal spray in your eyes or mouth. Important information you need to know before using olopatadine HCl nasal spray Use olopatadine HCl nasal spray exactly how your healthcare provider tells you to use it. Your olopatadine HCl nasal spray bottle must be shaken and primed before you use it for the first time and when you have not used it for more than 7 days. Throw away olopatadine HCl nasal spray after 240 sprays after the first priming. Even though the bottle may not be completely empty, you may not get the correct dose of medicine if you continue to use it. Using olopatadine HCl nasal spray Step 1. Remove the white plastic overcap and the white safety clip just under the \u201cshoulders\u201d of the pump (see Figure A ). Figure A Step 2. Hold the bottle and press down on the shoulders of the nasal applicator with your forefinger and middle finger. Support the bottom of the bottle with your thumb (see Figure B ). Prime the bottle by pressing and releasing the shoulders of the bottle down firmly 5 times or until you see a fine mist come out of the nasal applicator. Now your pump is primed and ready to use. If you do not use olopatadine HCl nasal spray for more than 7 days, you will need to prime the bottle again by pressing and releasing the shoulders of the bottle down firmly 2 times or until you see a fine mist come out of the nasal applicator. Figure B Step 3. Gently blow your nose to clear your nostrils. Hold 1 nostril closed with a finger. Tilt your head down (chin toward chest) and insert the nasal applicator into a nostril.

While breathing in, press firmly and quickly on the nasal applicator shoulders to release the spray into your nostril (see Figure C ). Figure C Step 5. Breathe out through your mouth. Do not tilt your head back or blow your nose right after using olopatadine HCl nasal spray. This may cause you to get a bitter taste in your mouth. Step 6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 above to deliver a spray in your other nostril. Step 7. If your healthcare provider tells you to use 2 sprays in each nostril, repeat Steps 3 through 5 for the second spray in each nostril. Step 8. Wipe the nasal applicator with a clean tissue and replace the plastic cap (see Figure D ). Figure D Cleaning the olopatadine HCl nasal spray nasal applicator Step 9. To clean the nasal applicator, remove the plastic cap (see Figure E ). If the nasal applicator becomes clogged, do not try to clear it using a pointed object. Figure E Step 10. Gently pull the nasal applicator up to remove it from the bottle (see Figure F ). Figure F Step 11. With the nasal applicator pointing downwards, wash it by running warm tap water into the nasal applicator for about 1 minute (see Figure G ). Step 12. Shake the nasal applicator to remove any water and put the nasal applicator back on the bottle. Step 13. Prime the bottle again by pressing the shoulders of the bottle down firmly and releasing the shoulders 2 times or until you see a fine mist come out of the white nasal applicator. Repeat Steps 11 and 12 above if the nasal applicator is still clogged. Figure G How should I store olopatadine HCl nasal spray?

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Epistaxis, Nasal Ulceration, and Nasal Septal Perforation : Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Discontinue if ulcerations or perforations occur. Avoid use in patients with nasal disease other than allergic rhinitis ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Avoid engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and coordination, such as driving or operating machinery when taking olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Avoid concurrent use of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray ( 5.2 ). 5.1 Local Nasal Effects Epistaxis and Nasal Ulceration In placebo-controlled clinical trials (vehicle nasal spray) of 2 weeks to 12 months duration, epistaxis and nasal ulcerations were reported [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Nasal Septal Perforation Three placebo-controlled long term (12 months) safety trials (vehicle nasal spray) were conducted. In the first safety trial, patients were treated with an investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray containing povidone (not the commercially marketed formulation) or a vehicle nasal spray containing povidone. Nasal septal perforations were reported in one patient treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 2 patients treated with the vehicle nasal spray. In the second safety trial with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, which does not contain povidone, there were no reports of nasal septal perforation. In the third safety trial, one patient exposed to the 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray (containing no povidone) reported a nasal septal perforation [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Before starting olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, conduct a nasal examination to ensure that patients are free of nasal disease other than allergic rhinitis. Perform nasal examinations periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa and consider stopping olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray if patients develop nasal ulcerations. 5.2 Somnolence and Impaired Mental Alertness In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients taking olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as driving or operating machinery after administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. Concurrent use of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most clinically significant adverse reactions described in other sections of labeling include: \u2022 Epistaxis, Nasal Ulceration, and Nasal Septal Perforation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] \u2022 Somnolence and Impaired Mental Alertness [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] The most common (>1%) adverse reactions, included bitter taste, headache, epistaxis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, post-nasal drip, cough, and urinary tract infection in patients 12 years of age and older and epistaxis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, bitter taste, pyrexia, and rash in patients 6 to 11 years of age ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Padagis at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below reflect exposure to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray in 2770 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis in 10 controlled clinical trials of 2 weeks to 12 months duration. Olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray is not indicated for use in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. The safety data from adults and adolescents are based upon 6 placebo-controlled clinical trials (3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray or 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray) in which 1834 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (652 males and 1182 females) 12 years of age and older were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily. There were 1180 patients (olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 587; vehicle nasal spray, 593) that participated in 3 efficacy and safety trials of 2 weeks duration. There were 2840 patients (olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 1247; 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, 1251; 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray, 342) that participated in 3 long-term clinical trials of 1-year duration. The racial distribution of adult and adolescent patients receiving olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was 77% white, 9% black, and 14% other. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in these controlled clinical trials was comparable for olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and vehicle nasal spray. Overall, 4.7% of the 1834 adult and adolescent patients across all 6 studies treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 3.5% of the 1844 patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to adverse reactions, and 2.9% of the 342 patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to adverse reactions. The safety data from pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age are based upon 3 clinical trials in which 870 children with seasonal allergic rhinitis (376 females and 494 males) were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray one or two sprays per nostril twice daily for 2 weeks. The racial distribution of pediatric patients receiving olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was 68.6% white, 16.6% black, and 14.8% other. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in these controlled clinical trials was comparable for olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and vehicle nasal spray. Overall, 1.4% of the 870 pediatric patients across all 3 studies treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 1.3% of the 872 pediatric patients treated with vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to adverse reactions. Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older in Short-Term (2-week) Trials There were 1180 patients 12 years of age and older (olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 587; vehicle nasal spray, 593) that participated in 3 efficacy and safety trials of 2 weeks duration. Table 1 presents the most common adverse reactions (0.9% or greater in patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray) that occurred more frequently in patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray compared with vehicle nasal spray in the 3 clinical trials of 2 weeks duration. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 0.9% or Greater in Controlled Clinical Trials of 2 Weeks Duration with Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray in Adolescent and Adult Patients 12 Years of Age and Older With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Reaction Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years and Older Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray N = 587 Vehicle Nasal Spray N = 593 Bitter taste 75 (12.8%) 5 (0.8%) Headache 26 (4.4%) 24 (4.0%) Epistaxis 19 (3.2%) 10 (1.7%) Pharyngolaryngeal Pain 13 (2.2%) 8 (1.3%) Post-nasal drip 9 (1.5%) 5 (0.8%) Cough 8 (1.4%) 3 (0.5%) Urinary tract infection 7 (1.2%) 3 (0.5%) CPK elevation 5 (0.9%) 2 (0.3%) Dry mouth 5 (0.9%) 1 (0.2%) Fatigue 5 (0.9%) 4 (0.7%) Influenza 5 (0.9%) 1 (0.2%) Nasopharyngitis 5 (0.9%) 4 (0.7%) Somnolence 5 (0.9%) 2 (0.3%) Throat irritation 5 (0.9%) 0 (0.0%) There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender or race. Clinical trials did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age There were 1742 pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age (olopatadine nasal spray, 870; vehicle nasal spray, 872) with seasonal allergic rhinitis that participated in 3 clinical trials of 2 weeks duration. Two of the studies used the investigational formulation of olopatadine nasal spray, and one of the studies used olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. One study evaluated the safety of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray at doses of one and two sprays per nostril twice daily in 1188 patients, in which 298 were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 1 spray, 296 were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 2 sprays, 297 were exposed to vehicle 1 spray, and 297 were exposed to vehicle 2 sprays twice daily for 2 weeks. Table 2 presents the most common adverse reactions (greater than 1.0% in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray one spray per nostril) that occurred more frequently with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray compared with vehicle nasal spray. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of Greater than 1.0% in a Controlled Clinical Trial of 2 Weeks Duration With Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray in Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Reaction Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray One Spray per Nostril N = 298 Vehicle Nasal Spray One Spray per Nostril N = 297 Epistaxis Headache Upper respiratory tract infection Bitter taste 17 (5.7%) 13 (4.4%) 8 (2.6%) 3 (1.0%) 11 (3.7%) 11 (3.7%) 0 0 Pyrexia 4 (1.3%) 3 (1.0%) Rash 4 (1.3%) 0 There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender, race, or ethnicity. Long-Term (12 month) Safety Trials In a 12-month, placebo-controlled, safety trial (vehicle nasal spray), 890 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were randomized to treatment with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily (445 patients) or vehicle nasal spray (445 patients). In the olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and vehicle nasal spray groups, 72% and 74% of patients, respectively, completed the trial. Overall, 7% and 5%, respectively, discontinued study participation due to an adverse reaction. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was epistaxis, which occurred in 25% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 28% in patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Epistaxis resulted in discontinuation of 0.9% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 0.2% of patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulcerations occurred in 10% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 9% of patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulcerations resulted in discontinuation of 0.4% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 0.2% patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. There were no patients with nasal septal perforation in either treatment group. Somnolence was reported in 1 patient treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. Weight increase was reported in 6 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. Depression or worsening of depression occurred in 9 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and in 5 patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Three patients, 2 of whom had preexisting histories of depression, who received olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray were hospitalized for depression compared to none who received vehicle nasal spray. In a second 12-month, placebo-controlled, safety trial (vehicle nasal spray), 459 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with two sprays per nostril of an investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray containing povidone (not the commercially marketed formulation) and 465 patients were treated with 2 sprays of a vehicle nasal spray containing povidone. Nasal septal perforations were reported in one patient treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 2 patients treated with the vehicle nasal spray. Epistaxis was reported in 19% of patients treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 12% of patients treated with vehicle nasal spray. Somnolence was reported in 3 patients treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray compared to 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. Fatigue was reported in 5 patients treated with the investigational formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray compared to 1 patient treated with vehicle nasal spray. In a third 3-arm, 12-month, placebo-controlled, safety trial (vehicle nasal spray), conducted post approval, 1026 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were randomized to treatment with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray (343 patients), a 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray (341 patients), or a 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray (342 patients). All treatments were administered as two sprays per nostril, twice daily. Overall, 5% of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray patients, 2% of 3.7 pH vehicle patients and 3% of 7.0 pH vehicle patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was epistaxis, which occurred in 24% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 20% of patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, and 23% of patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. Epistaxis resulted in the discontinuation of 2 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and 1 patient treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. Nasal septal perforation was reported for one patient treated with the 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulcerations occurred in 9% of patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 8% of patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, and 9% of patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. Nasal ulceration resulted in the discontinuation of 1 patient treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. Hyposmia and anosmia were each reported by one patient treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. Neither somnolence nor weight loss was reported. Depression occurred in 3 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, 2 patients treated with 3.7 pH vehicle nasal spray, and 3 patients treated with 7.0 pH vehicle nasal spray. There were no long-term clinical trials in children below 12 years of age. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most common adverse reactions reported include dizziness, dysgeusia, epistaxis, headache, nasal discomfort, oropharyngeal pain, and somnolence. Additionally, hyposmia and anosmia have been reported with the use of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from postmarketing experience with antihistamines, with similar mechanism of action to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, there are no published human data specific to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of olopatadine hydrochloride to pregnant rats and rabbits caused a decrease in the number of live fetuses at maternal doses approximately 110 and 1460 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4%, and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an oral embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rabbits were dosed throughout the period of organogenesis at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. A decrease in the number of live fetuses was observed at 400 mg/kg/day (1460 times the MRHDID, on a mg/m 2 basis). In an oral embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rats were dosed throughout the period of organogenesis at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. Maternal toxicity, producing death and reduced maternal body weight gain was observed at 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 1100 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis). Olopatadine produced cleft palate at 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 110 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis) and decreased embryo-fetal viability and reduced fetal weight in rats at 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 1100 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis). In peri-/postnatal toxicity studies, pregnant rats received oral doses of olopatadine up to 600 mg/kg/day during late gestation and throughout the lactation period. Olopatadine produced decreased neonatal survival at 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 110 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis) and reduced body weight gain in pups at 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 7 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis). These effects appeared attributable to exposure of pups via the milk as demonstrated in a cross-fostered study in which pups of untreated dams cross-fostered to dams treated with 60 mg/kg/day olopatadine orally during the lactation period exhibited decreased body weight gain. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of olopatadine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Although orally administered olopatadine is present in rat milk, there is no information about nasally administered olopatadine. It is not known whether topical nasal administration could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human breast milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray and any potential adverse effects on the breast fed infant from olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age are supported by 3 vehicle-controlled 2-week studies in 870 patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Doses studied included one and two sprays per nostril twice daily. One of these studies evaluated the safety of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray at doses of one and two sprays per nostril twice daily in 1,188 patients, of which 298 patients were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 1 spray and 297 patients were exposed to vehicle 1 spray. In this study, the incidence of epistaxis with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray use was 5.7% [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older are supported by 3 randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 weeks duration in adult and adolescent patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . In these studies, the incidence of epistaxis with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray use in 587 patients was 3.2% [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray have not been established in pediatric patients under 6 years of age. The safety of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray at a dose of one spray per nostril twice daily was evaluated in one 2-week vehicle-controlled study in 132 pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis. In this trial, 66 patients were exposed to olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. The most common (greater than 1.0%) adverse reactions reported were diarrhea (9.1%), epistaxis (6.1%), rhinorrhea (4.5%), bitter taste (3.0%) and wheezing (3.0%). Diarrhea was reported more frequently (9.1%) in patients 2 to 5 years of age than 6 to 11 year old age group (< 1%). 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Olopatadine is a histamine H 1 receptor antagonist. The antihistaminic activity of olopatadine has been documented in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a placebo-controlled cardiovascular safety study, 32 healthy volunteers received 20 mg oral solution of olopatadine twice daily for 14 days (8-fold greater daily dose than the recommended daily nasal dose). The mean QTcF (QT corrected by Fridericia\u2019s correction method for heart rate) change from baseline was -2.7 msec and -3.8 msec for olopatadine, and placebo, respectively. In this study, 8 subjects treated with olopatadine had a QTcF change from baseline of 30-60 msec, 1 subject had a QTcF change from baseline greater than 60 msec, and no subjects had QTcF values greater than 500 msec. Eight subjects treated with placebo had a QTcF change from baseline of 30-60 msec, no subjects had a QTcF change from baseline greater than 60 msec, and no subjects had QTcF values greater than 500 msec. In a 12-month study in 429 perennial allergic rhinitis patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily, no evidence of any effect of olopatadine hydrochloride on QT prolongation was observed. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of olopatadine were studied after administration by the nasal, oral, intravenous, and topical ocular routes. Olopatadine exhibited linear pharmacokinetics across the routes studied over a large dose range. Absorption Healthy Subjects: Olopatadine was absorbed with individual peak plasma concentrations observed between 30 minutes and 1 hour after twice daily intranasal administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. The mean ( \u00b1 SD) steady-state peak plasma concentration (C max ) of olopatadine was 16.0 \u00b1 8.99 ng/mL. Systemic exposure as indexed by area under the curve (AUC 0-12 ) averaged 66.0 \u00b1 26.8 ng\u00b7h/mL. The average absolute bioavailability of intranasal olopatadine is 57%. The mean accumulation ratio following multiple intranasal administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was about 1.3. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Patients: Systemic exposure of olopatadine in seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients after twice daily intranasal administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was comparable to that observed in healthy subjects. Olopatadine was absorbed with peak plasma concentrations observed between 15 minutes and 2 hours. The mean steady-state C max was 23.3 \u00b1 6.2 ng/mL and AUC 0-12 averaged 78.0 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL. Distribution The protein binding of olopatadine was moderate at approximately 55% in human serum, and independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.1 to 1000 ng/mL. Olopatadine was bound predominately to human serum albumin. Elimination The plasma elimination half-life of olopatadine is 8 to 12 hours. Olopatadine is mainly eliminated through urinary excretion. Approximately 70% of a [ 14 C] olopatadine hydrochloride oral dose was recovered in urine with 17% in the feces. Of the drug-related material recovered within the first 24 hours in the urine, 86% was unchanged olopatadine with the balance comprised of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine. Metabolism Olopatadine is not extensively metabolized. Based on plasma metabolite profiles following oral administration of [ 14 C] olopatadine, at least six minor metabolites circulate in human plasma. Olopatadine accounts for 77% of peak plasma total radioactivity and all metabolites amounted to < 6% combined. Two of these have been identified as the olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine. In in vitro studies with cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP) and flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO), N-desmethyl olopatadine (Ml) formation was catalyzed mainly by CYP3A4, while olopatadine N-oxide (M3) was primarily catalyzed by FMO1 and FMO3. Olopatadine at concentrations up to 33,900 ng/mL did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. The potential for olopatadine and its metabolites to act as inducers of CYP enzymes has not been evaluated. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic study examining the effect of hepatic impairment was conducted. Since metabolism of olopatadine is a minor route of elimination, no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray is warranted in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with Renal Impairment The mean C max values for olopatadine following single nasal doses were not markedly different between healthy subjects (18.1 ng/mL) and patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment (range 15.5 to 21.6 ng/mL). The mean plasma AUC 0-12 was 2-fold higher in patients with severe impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). In these patients, peak steady-state plasma concentrations of olopatadine are approximately 10-fold lower than those observed after higher 20 mg oral doses, twice daily, which were well-tolerated. These findings indicate that no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray is warranted in patients with renal impairment. Male and Female Patients The mean systemic exposure (C max and AUC 0-12 ) in female SAR patients following multiple administration of olopatadine was 40% and 27% higher, respectively than those values observed in male SAR patients. Racial or Ethnic Groups The effects of race on olopatadine pharmacokinetics have not been adequately investigated. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine in patients 6 through 11 years of age were characterized using data from 42 pediatric patients administered olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, one spray per nostril twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max (15.4 \u00b1 7.3 ng/mL) of olopatadine was approximately 2-fold less than was comparable to that observed in adults (78.0 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL). The C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide were comparable to that observed in adults. The C max and AUC 0-12 of N-desmethyl olopatadine are approximately 18% and 37% higher than that observed in adults, respectively. Pediatric Patients 2 to 5 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide, and N-desmethyl olopatadine were characterized using population pharmacokinetic methods applied to sparse data (approximately 5 samples per patient) obtained from 66 pediatric patients (2 to less than 6 years of age) administered one-half the recommended adult dose (one spray per nostril) of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine were 13.4 \u00b1 4.6 ng/mL and 75.0 \u00b1 26.4 ng\u2022hr/mL respectively. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine were similar to that of patients 6 to 11 years of age.

The 3 clinical trials were conducted in the United States and included 1598 patients (556 males, and 1042 females) 12 years of age and older. In these 3 trials, 587 patients were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 0.6%, 418 patients were treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 0.4%, and 593 patients were treated with vehicle nasal spray. Assessment of efficacy was based on patient recording of 4 individual nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, and sneezing) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) as reflective or instantaneous scores. Reflective scoring required patients to record symptom severity over the previous 12 hours; the instantaneous scoring required patients to record symptom severity at the time of recording. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference from placebo in the percent change from baseline in the average of morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) averaged for the 2-week treatment period. In all 3 trials, patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, two sprays per nostril, twice-daily, exhibited statistically significantly greater decreases in rTNSS compared to vehicle nasal spray. Results for the rTNSS from 2 representative trials are shown in Table 3. Table 3: Mean Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) in Adult and Adolescent Patients With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Study No. Treatment N Baseline Change from Baseline Difference from Placebo Estimate 95% CI p-value Study 1 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.6% 183 8.71 -3.63 -0.96 (-1.42, -0.51) <0.0001 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.4% 188 8.90 -3.38 -0.71 (-1.17, -0.26) 0.0023 Vehicle Nasal Spray 191 8.75 -2.67 Study 2 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.6% 220 9.17 -2.90 -0.98 (-1.37, -0.59) <0.0001 Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.4% 228 9.26 -2.63 -0.72 (-1.11, -0.33) 0.0003 Vehicle Nasal Spray 223 9.07 -1.92 Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval. Itchy eyes and watery eyes were evaluated as secondary endpoints but eye redness was not evaluated. In 2 of the studies, patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray had significantly greater decreases in reflective symptom scores for itchy eyes and watery eyes, compared to vehicle nasal spray. In the 2-week seasonal allergy trials, onset of action was also evaluated by instantaneous TNSS assessments twice-daily after the first dose of study medication. In these trials, onset of action was seen after 1 day of dosing. Onset of action was evaluated in 3 environmental exposure unit studies with single doses of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. In these studies, patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to high levels of pollen in the environmental exposure unit and then treated with either olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray or vehicle nasal spray, two sprays in each nostril, after which they self-reported their allergy symptoms hourly as instantaneous scores for the subsequent 12 hours. Olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 0.6% was found to have an onset of action of 30 minutes after dosing in the environmental exposure unit. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age There were 3 clinical trials of 2 weeks duration with olopatadine nasal spray in patients 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Efficacy of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was evaluated in 2 of the 3 trials. One of the 2 trials that showed efficacy was a randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo (vehicle nasal spray)-controlled clinical trial of 2 weeks duration, including 1188 children ages 6 to < 12 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Assessment of efficacy was based on patient/caregiver recording of 4 individual nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, and sneezing) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) as reflective or instantaneous scores. Reflective scoring captured symptom severity over the previous 12 hours; the instantaneous scoring captured symptom severity at the time of recording. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference from placebo in the percent change from baseline in the average of patient/caregiver-reported morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) averaged for the 2-week treatment period. Patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, one or two sprays per nostril twice daily, had statistically significantly greater decreases in rTNSS compared to vehicle nasal spray. Results for rTNSS are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Mean Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score in Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Treatment N Baseline Change from Baseline Difference from Placebo Estimate 95% CI p-value Olopatadine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.6%, one spray per nostril twice daily 294 8.99 -2.24 -0.55 (-0.90, -0.19) 0.0015 Vehicle Nasal Spray, one spray per nostril twice daily 294 9.09 -1.70 Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval. Itchy eyes and watery eyes were evaluated as secondary endpoints in the same study but eye redness was not evaluated. Patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray had significantly greater decreases in reflective symptom scores for itchy eyes and watery eyes, compared to vehicle nasal spray."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C Olopatadine was found not to be teratogenic in rats and rabbits. However, rats treated at 600 mg/kg/day, or 150,000 times the MROHD and rabbits treated at 400 mg/kg/day, or approximately 100,000 times the MROHD, during organogenesis showed a decrease in live fetuses. In addition, rats treated with 600 mg/kg/day of olopatadine during organogenesis showed a decrease in fetal weight. Further, rats treated with 600 mg/kg/day of olopatadine during late gestation through the lactation period showed a decrease in neonatal survival and body weight. There are, however, no adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human responses, this drug should be used in pregnant women only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the embryo or fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Olopatadine has been identified in the milk of nursing rats following oral administration. It is not known whether topical ocular administration could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in the human breast milk. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution USP, 0.2% is administered to a nursing mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Olopatadine is a mast cell stabilizer and a histamine H1 antagonist. Decreased chemotaxis and inhibition of eosinophil activation has also been demonstrated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic bioavailability data upon topical ocular administration of olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution USP, 0.2% are not available. Following topical ocular administration of olopatadine 0.15% ophthalmic solution in man, olopatadine was shown to have a low systemic exposure. Two studies in normal volunteers (totaling 24 subjects) dosed bilaterally with olopatadine 0.15% ophthalmic solution once every 12 hours for 2 weeks demonstrated plasma concentrations to be generally below the quantitation limit of the assay (< 0.5 ng/mL). Samples in which olopatadine was quantifiable were typically found within 2 hours of dosing and ranged from 0.5 to 1.3 ng/mL. The elimination half-life in plasma following oral dosing was 8 to 12 hours, and elimination was predominantly through renal excretion. Approximately 60 \u2013 70 % of the dose was recovered in the urine as parent drug. Two metabolites, the mono-desmethyl and the N-oxide, were detected at low concentrations in the urine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Olopatadine administered orally was not carcinogenic in mice and rats in doses up to 500 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively. Based on a 40 \u03bcL drop size and a 50 kg person, these doses were approximately 150,000 and 50,000 times higher than the maximum recommended ocular human dose (MROHD). No mutagenic potential was observed when olopatadine was tested in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test, an in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration assay or an in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Olopatadine administered to male and female rats at oral doses of approximately 100,000 times MROHD level resulted in a slight decrease in the fertility index and reduced implantation rate; no effects on reproductive function were observed at doses of approximately 15,000 times the MROHD level."
