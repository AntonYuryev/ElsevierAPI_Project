    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Octreotide Acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. ( 2.1 ) Acromegaly : Recommended initial Octreotide Acetate injection dosage is 50 mcg three times daily during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. Maintenance dose 100 mcg to 500 mcg three times daily. ( 2.2 ) Carcinoid Tumors : Recommended dosage range of 100 mcg to 600 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.3 ) VIPomas : Recommended dosage range of 200 mcg to 300 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Dosage and Administration Overview Octreotide Acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. Pain with subcutaneous administration may be reduced by using the smallest volume that will deliver the desired dose. Sites should be rotated in a systematic manner. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if particulates and/or discoloration are observed. Octreotide Acetate injection is not compatible in Total Parenteral Nutrition solutions because of the formation of a glycosyl octreotide conjugate which may decrease the efficacy of the product. Octreotide Acetate injection may be diluted in volumes of 50 mL to 200 mL and infused intravenously over 15 to 30 minutes or administered by intravenous (IV) push over 3 minutes. In emergency situations (e.g., carcinoid crisis), it may be given by rapid bolus. Assess total and/or free T4 levels at baseline and periodically during chronic octreotide acetate therapy. 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Acromegaly The recommended initial dosage of octreotide acetate is 50 mcg three times daily to be administered subcutaneously. Increase octreotide acetate dose based upon GH or IGF-1 levels. The goal is to achieve GH levels less than 5 ng/mL or IGF-1 levels within normal range. Monitor GH or IGF-1 every two weeks after initiating octreotide acetate therapy or with dosage change, and to guide titration. The most common dosage is 100 mcg three times daily, but some patients require up to 500 mcg three times daily for maximum effectiveness. Doses greater than 300 mcg/day seldom result in additional biochemical benefit, and if an increase in dose fails to provide additional benefit, the dose should be reduced. Octreotide Acetate injection should be withdrawn yearly for approximately 4 weeks from patients who have received irradiation to assess disease activity. If GH or IGF-1 levels increase and signs and symptoms recur, Octreotide Acetate injection therapy may be resumed. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Carcinoid Tumors The recommended daily dosage of Octreotide Acetate injection during the first 2 weeks of therapy ranges from 100 to 600 mcg/day in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously (mean daily dosage is 300 mcg). In the clinical studies, the median daily maintenance dosage was approximately 450 mcg, but clinical and biochemical benefits were obtained in some patients with as little as 50 mcg, while others required doses up to 1500 mcg/day. However, experience with doses above 750 mcg/day is limited. Measurement of urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, plasma serotonin, plasma Substance P may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy. 2.4 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors Daily dosages of 200 mcg to 300 mcg in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously are recommended during the initial 2 weeks of therapy (range, 150 mcg to 750 mcg) to control symptoms of the disease. On an individual basis, dosage may be adjusted to achieve a therapeutic response, but usually doses above 450 mcg/day are not required. Measurement of Plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy. Discard unused portion."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac Function Abnormalities : Increased risk for higher degree of atrioventricular blocks. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Bradycardia, arrhythmias, or conduction abnormalities may occur. Use with caution in at-risk patients. Dosage adjustment of cardiac medications may be necessary. ( 5.1 ) Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis : Monitor periodically. Discontinue if complications of cholelithiasis are suspected. ( 5.2 ) Glucose Metabolism : Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia may occur. Glucose monitoring is recommended and anti-diabetic treatment may need adjustment. ( 5.3 ) Thyroid Function : Hypothyroidism may occur. Monitor thyroid levels periodically. ( 5.4 ) Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats : New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss may occur. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported, evaluate for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Cardiac Function Abnormalities Complete Atrioventricular Block Patients who receive octreotide acetate injection intravenously may be at increased risk for higher degree atrioventricular blocks. In postmarketing reports, complete atrioventricular block was reported in patients receiving IV octreotide acetate injection during surgical procedures. In the majority of patients, octreotide acetate injection was given at higher than recommended doses and/or as a continuous IV infusion. The safety of continuous IV infusion has not been established in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection for the approved indications. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Other Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities Other cardiac conduction abnormalities have occurred during treatment with octreotide acetate injection. In acromegalic patients, bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias occurred in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . Other electrocardiogram (ECG) changes observed included QT prolongation, axis shifts, early repolarization, low voltage, R/S transition, and early R-wave progression. These ECG changes are not uncommon in acromegalic patients. Dose adjustments in drugs such as beta-blockers that have bradycardia effects may be necessary. In one acromegalic patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy resulted in worsening of CHF with improvement when drug was discontinued. Confirmation of a drug effect was obtained with a positive rechallenge. 5.2 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis Octreotide acetate injection may inhibit gallbladder contractility and decrease bile secretion, which may lead to gallbladder abnormalities or sludge. Acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, biliary obstruction, cholestatic hepatitis, or pancreatitis have been reported with octreotide acetate injection therapy. In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. One patient developed ascending cholangitis during octreotide acetate injection therapy and died. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue octreotide acetate injection and treat appropriately. 5.3 Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia Octreotide acetate injection alters the balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon and GH, which may result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia which occurs during octreotide acetate injection therapy is usually mild but may result in overt diabetes mellitus or necessitate dose changes in insulin or other anti-diabetic agents. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred on octreotide acetate injection in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . Severe hyperglycemia, subsequent pneumonia, and death following initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy was reported in one patient with no history of hyperglycemia. Monitor glucose levels during octreotide acetate injection therapy. Adjust dosing of insulin or other anti-diabetic therapy accordingly. 5.4 Thyroid Function Abnormalities Octreotide suppresses secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which may result in hypothyroidism. Baseline and periodic assessment of thyroid function (TSH, total, and/or free T 4 ) is recommended during chronic therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . 5.5 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration and loose stools have been reported in patients receiving somatostatin analogs, including octreotide acetate. Somatostatin analogs reversibly inhibit secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile acids, which may result in malabsorption of dietary fats and subsequent symptoms of steatorrhea, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported in patients receiving octreotide acetate, evaluate patients for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and manage accordingly. 5.6 Changes in Vitamin B12 Levels Depressed vitamin B 12 levels and abnormal Schilling\u2019s tests have been observed in some patients receiving octreotide acetate injection therapy, and monitoring of vitamin B 12 levels is recommended during octreotide acetate injection therapy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Complete Atrioventricular Block [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Thyroid Function Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Changes in Vitamin B12 Levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) in patients with acromegaly are gallbladder abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, abdominal discomfort, hyperglycemia, and hypothyroidism. In other patients, most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) are gallbladder abnormalities. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-844-824-8426 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Gallbladder Abnormalities Gallbladder abnormalities, especially stones and/or biliary sludge, frequently develop in patients on chronic octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. Cardiac In acromegalics, sinus bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias developed in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Gastrointestinal Diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, and abdominal discomfort were each seen in 34% to 61% of acromegalic patients in U.S. studies. 2.6% of the patients discontinued therapy due to these symptoms. These symptoms were seen in 5% to 10% of patients with carcinoid tumors and VIPomas. The frequency of these symptoms was not dose related, but diarrhea and abdominal discomfort generally resolved more quickly in patients treated with 300 mcg/day than in those treated with 750 mcg/day. Vomiting, flatulence, abnormal stools, abdominal distention, and constipation were each seen in less than 10% of patients. In rare instances, gastrointestinal side effects may resemble acute intestinal obstruction, with progressive abdominal distension, severe epigastric pain, abdominal tenderness, and guarding. Hypo/Hyperglycemia Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively, but only in about 1.5% of other patients. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were noted in approximately 2% of patients. Hypothyroidism In acromegalics, biochemical hypothyroidism alone occurred in 12% while goiter occurred in 8% and 4% required initiation of thyroid replacement therapy during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . In patients without acromegaly, hypothyroidism has only been reported in several isolated patients and goiter has not been reported. Other Adverse Events Pain on injection was reported in 7.7%, headache in 6%, and dizziness in 5%. Pancreatitis was also observed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Other Adverse Events 1% to 4% Other events, each observed in 1% to 4% of patients, included fatigue, weakness, pruritus, joint pain, backache, urinary tract infection, cold symptoms, flu symptoms, injection site hematoma, bruise, edema, flushing, blurred vision, pollakiuria, fat malabsorption, hair loss, visual disturbance, and depression. Anaphylactoid reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported in several patients receiving octreotide acetate injection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of octreotide acetate injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary : cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cholangitis and pancreatitis, which have sometimes required cholecystectomy Gastrointestinal : intestinal obstruction, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency Hematologic : thrombocytopenia"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The following drugs require monitoring and possible dose adjustment when used with octreotide acetate injection : cyclosporine, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, beta-blockers, and bromocriptine. ( 7 ) Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection : Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Cyclosporine Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. Concomitant administration of octreotide acetate injection with cyclosporine may decrease blood levels of cyclosporine and result in transplant rejection. 7.2 Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Drugs Octreotide inhibits the secretion of insulin and glucagon. Therefore, blood glucose levels should be monitored when octreotide acetate injection treatment is initiated or when the dose is altered and anti-diabetic treatment should be adjusted accordingly. 7.3 Bromocriptine Concomitant administration of octreotide and bromocriptine increases the availability of bromocriptine. 7.4 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy Concomitant administration of bradycardia-inducing drugs (e.g., beta-blockers) may have an additive effect on the reduction of heart rate associated with octreotide. Dose adjustments of concomitant medication may be necessary. Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. 7.5 Drug Metabolism Interactions Limited published data indicate that somatostatin analogs might decrease the metabolic clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which may be due to the suppression of GH. Since it cannot be excluded that octreotide may have this effect, other drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and which have a low therapeutic index (e.g., quinidine, terfenadine) should therefore be used with caution. 7.6 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection Octreotide competitively binds to somatostatin receptors and may interfere with the efficacy of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited data with octreotide acetate injection in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental-effects were observed with IV administration of octreotide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 7- and 13-times, respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.5 mg/day based on body surface area (BSA). Transient growth retardation, with no impact on postnatal development, was observed in rat offspring from a pre- and post-natal study of octreotide at IV doses below the MRHD based on BSA ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In postmarketing data, a limited number of exposed pregnancies have been reported in patients with acromegaly. Most women were exposed to octreotide during the first trimester of pregnancy at doses ranging from 100 to 300 mcg/day of octreotide acetate injection or 20 mg to 30 mg once a month of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, however some women elected to continue octreotide therapy throughout pregnancy. In cases with a known outcome, no congenital malformations were reported. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received IV doses of octreotide up to 1 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. A slight reduction in body weight gain was noted in pregnant rats at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day. There were no maternal effects in rabbits or embryo-fetal effects in either species up to the maximum dose tested. At 1 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, the dose multiple was approximately 7- and 13-times, respectively, at the highest recommended human dose of 1.5 mg/day based on BSA. In a pre- and post-natal development rat study at IV doses of 0.02-1 mg/kg/day, a transient growth retardation of the offspring was observed at all doses which was possibly a consequence of GH inhibition by octreotide. The doses attributed to the delayed growth are below the human dose of 1.5 mg/day, based on BSA. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of octreotide acetate injection in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies show that octreotide administered subcutaneously passes into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk ( see Data ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for octreotide acetate injection, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from octreotide acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Following a subcutaneous dose (1 mg/kg) of octreotide to lactating rats, transfer of octreotide into milk was observed at a low concentration compared to plasma (milk/plasma ratio of 0.009). 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as the therapeutic benefits of a reduction in GH levels and normalization of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration in acromegalic females treated with octreotide may lead to improved fertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of octreotide acetate injection in the pediatric population have not been demonstrated. No formal controlled clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of octreotide acetate injection in pediatric patients under age 6 years. In postmarketing reports, serious adverse events, including hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death, have been reported with octreotide acetate injection use in children, most notably in children under 2 years of age. The relationship of these events to octreotide has not been established as the majority of these pediatric patients had serious underlying co-morbid conditions. The efficacy and safety of octreotide acetate injection using the octreotide acetate for injectable suspension formulation was examined in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6 month pharmacokinetics study in 60 pediatric patients age 6 to 17 years with hypothalamic obesity resulting from cranial insult. The mean octreotide concentration after 6 doses of 40 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by intramuscular (IM) injection every 4 weeks was approximately 3 ng/mL. Steady-state concentrations was achieved after 3 injections of a 40-mg dose. Mean body mass index (BMI) increased 0.1 kg/m 2 in octreotide acetate for injectable suspension-treated subjects compared to 0.0 kg/m 2 in saline control-treated subjects. Efficacy was not demonstrated. Diarrhea occurred in 11 of 30 (37%) patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. No unexpected adverse events were observed. However, with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adult indications such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was 10 mg to 30 mg once a month. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of octreotide acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, the half-life of octreotide acetate may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment-Cirrhotic Patients In patients with liver cirrhosis, the half-life of the drug may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Octreotide acetate injection exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin. It is an even more potent inhibitor of GH, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it also suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, VIP, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide. By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and VIP secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Octreotide substantially reduces GH and/or IGF-1 (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly. Single doses of octreotide have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Octreotide suppresses secretion of TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection, octreotide is absorbed rapidly and completely from the injection site. Peak concentrations of 5.2 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) were reached 0.4 hours after dosing. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, IV and subcutaneous doses were found to be bioequivalent. Peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) values were dose proportional after IV single doses up to 200 mcg and subcutaneous single doses up to 500 mcg and after subcutaneous multiple doses up to 500 mcg 3 times a day (1,500 mcg/day). In patients with acromegaly, a mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing. Distribution In healthy volunteers, the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (t\u03b1\u00bd = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 13.6 L, and the total body clearance ranged from 7 L/hr to 10 L/hr. In blood, the distribution into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner. Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. In patients with acromegaly, the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 21.6 \u00b1 8.5 L, and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h. The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%. Elimination The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 to 1.9 hours compared with 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone. The duration of action of octreotide acetate injection is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor. About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine. In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug. In patients with acromegaly, the disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normal subjects. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR 40 to 60 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 2.4 hours and total body clearance was 8.8 L/hr, in moderate impairment (CL CR 10 to 39 mL/min) t 1/2 was 3.0 hours and total body clearance 7.3 L/hr. In patients with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis (CL CR < 10 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 3.1 hours and total body clearance was 7.6 L/hr. In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, total body clearance was reduced to about half that found in healthy subjects (from approximately 10 L/hr to 4.5 L/hr). Hepatic Impairment Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide t 1/2 increasing to 3.7 hr and total body clearance decreasing to 5.9 L/hr, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed t 1/2 increased to 3.4 hr and total body clearance of 8.2 L/hr. 12.6 Immunogenicity Evaluation of 20 patients treated for at least 6 months has failed to demonstrate titers of antibodies exceeding background levels. However, antibody titers to octreotide acetate injection were subsequently reported in 3 patients and resulted in prolonged duration of drug action in 2 patients."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated no mutagenic potential of octreotide acetate injection. No carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in mice treated subcutaneously for 85 to 99 weeks at doses up to 2,000 mcg/kg/day (8 x the human exposure based on BSA). In a 116-week subcutaneous study in rats, a 27% and 12% incidence of injection-site sarcomas or squamous cell carcinomas was observed in males and females, respectively, at the highest dose level of 1,250 mcg/kg/day (10 x the human exposure based on BSA) compared to an incidence of 8% to 10% in the vehicle-control groups. The increased incidence of injection-site tumors was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to repeated subcutaneous injections at the same site. Rotating injection sites would prevent chronic irritation in humans. There have been no reports of injection-site tumors in patients treated with octreotide acetate for up to 5 years. There was also a 15% incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas in the 1,250 mcg/kg/day females compared to 7% in the saline-control females and 0% in the vehicle-control females. The presence of endometritis coupled with the absence of corpora lutea, the reduction in mammary fibroadenomas, and the presence of uterine dilatation suggest that the uterine tumors were associated with estrogen dominance in the aged female rats which does not occur in humans. Octreotide did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 1,000 mcg/kg/day, which represents 7-times the human exposure based on BSA."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Octreotide acetate injection is a somatostatin analogue indicated: Acromegaly : To reduce blood levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1; somatomedin C) in acromegaly patients who have had inadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgical resection, pituitary irradiation, and bromocriptine mesylate at maximally tolerated doses. ( 1.1 ) Carcinoid Tumors : For the symptomatic treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors where it suppresses or inhibits the severe diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with the disease. ( 1.2 ) Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors (VIPomas) : For the treatment of profuse watery diarrhea associated with VIP-secreting tumors. ( 1.3 ) Limitations of Use Improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, or reduction in tumor size or rate of growth, were not shown in clinical trials performed with octreotide acetate injection; these trials were not optimally designed to detect such effects. ( 1.4 ) 1.1 Acromegaly Octreotide acetate injection is indicated to reduce blood levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1; somatomedin C) in acromegaly patients who have had inadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgical resection, pituitary irradiation, and bromocriptine mesylate at maximally tolerated doses. 1.2 Carcinoid Tumors Octreotide acetate injection is indicated for treatment of severe diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors. 1.3 Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors Octreotide acetate injection is indicated for the treatment of the profuse watery diarrhea associated with vasoactive intestinal peptide tumors (VIPomas)-secreting tumors. 1.4 Important Limitations of Use Improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, or reduction in tumor size or rate of growth, were not shown in clinical trials performed with octreotide acetate injection; these trials were not optimally designed to detect such effects."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. ( 2.1 ) Acromegaly : Recommended initial octreotide acetate dosage is 50 mcg three times daily during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. Maintenance dose 100 mcg to 500 mcg three times daily. ( 2.2 ) Carcinoid Tumors : Recommended dosage range of 100 mcg to 600 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.3 ) VIPomas : Recommended dosage range of 200 mcg to 300 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Dosage and Administration Overview Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. Pain with subcutaneous administration may be reduced by using the smallest volume that will deliver the desired dose. Sites should be rotated in a systematic manner. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if particulates and/or discoloration are observed. Octreotide acetate injection is not compatible in Total Parenteral Nutrition solutions because of the formation of a glycosyl octreotide conjugate which may decrease the efficacy of the product. Octreotide acetate injection may be diluted in volumes of 50 mL to 200 mL and infused intravenously over 15 to 30 minutes or administered by intravenous (IV) push over 3 minutes. In emergency situations (e.g., carcinoid crisis), it may be given by rapid bolus. Assess total and/or free T4 levels at baseline and periodically during chronic octreotide acetate therapy. 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Acromegaly The recommended initial dosage of octreotide acetate is 50 mcg three times daily to be administered subcutaneously. Increase octreotide acetate dose based upon GH or IGF-1 levels. The goal is to achieve GH levels less than 5 ng/mL or IGF-1 levels within normal range. Monitor GH or IGF-1 every two weeks after initiating octreotide acetate therapy or with dosage change, and to guide titration. The most common dosage is 100 mcg three times daily, but some patients require up to 500 mcg three times daily for maximum effectiveness. Doses greater than 300 mcg/day seldom result in additional biochemical benefit, and if an increase in dose fails to provide additional benefit, the dose should be reduced. Octreotide acetate injection should be withdrawn yearly for approximately 4 weeks from patients who have received irradiation to assess disease activity. If GH or IGF-1 levels increase and signs and symptoms recur, octreotide acetate injection therapy may be resumed. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Carcinoid Tumors The recommended daily dosage of octreotide acetate injection during the first 2 weeks of therapy ranges from 100 to 600 mcg/day in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously (mean daily dosage is 300 mcg). In the clinical studies, the median daily maintenance dosage was approximately 450 mcg, but clinical and biochemical benefits were obtained in some patients with as little as 50 mcg, while others required doses up to 1500 mcg/day. However, experience with doses above 750 mcg/day is limited. Measurement of urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, plasma serotonin, plasma Substance P may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy. 2.4 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors Daily dosages of 200 mcg to 300 mcg in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously are recommended during the initial 2 weeks of therapy (range, 150 mcg to 750 mcg) to control symptoms of the disease. On an individual basis, dosage may be adjusted to achieve a therapeutic response, but usually doses above 450 mcg/day are not required. Measurement of Plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac Function Abnormalities : Increased risk for higher degree of atrioventricular blocks. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Bradycardia, arrhythmias, or conduction abnormalities may occur. Use with caution in at-risk patients. Dosage adjustment of cardiac medications may be necessary. ( 5.1 ) Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis : Monitor periodically. Discontinue if complications of cholelithiasis are suspected. ( 5.2 ) Glucose Metabolism : Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia may occur. Glucose monitoring is recommended and anti-diabetic treatment may need adjustment. ( 5.3 ) Thyroid Function : Hypothyroidism may occur. Monitor thyroid levels periodically. ( 5.4 ) Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats : New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss may occur. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported, evaluate for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Cardiac Function Abnormalities Complete Atrioventricular Block Patients who receive octreotide acetate injection intravenously may be at increased risk for higher degree atrioventricular blocks. In postmarketing reports, complete atrioventricular block was reported in patients receiving IV octreotide acetate injection during surgical procedures. In the majority of patients, octreotide acetate injection was given at higher than recommended doses and/or as a continuous IV infusion. The safety of continuous IV infusion has not been established in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection for the approved indications. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Other Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities Other cardiac conduction abnormalities have occurred during treatment with octreotide acetate injection. In acromegalic patients, bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias occurred in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Other electrocardiogram (ECG) changes observed included QT prolongation, axis shifts, early repolarization, low voltage, R/S transition, and early R-wave progression. These ECG changes are not uncommon in acromegalic patients. Dose adjustments in drugs such as beta-blockers that have bradycardia effects may be necessary. In one acromegalic patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy resulted in worsening of CHF with improvement when drug was discontinued. Confirmation of a drug effect was obtained with a positive rechallenge. 5.2 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis Octreotide acetate injection may inhibit gallbladder contractility and decrease bile secretion, which may lead to gallbladder abnormalities or sludge. Acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, biliary obstruction, cholestatic hepatitis, or pancreatitis have been reported with octreotide acetate injection therapy. In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. One patient developed ascending cholangitis during octreotide acetate injection therapy and died. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue octreotide acetate injection and treat appropriately. 5.3 Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia Octreotide acetate injection alters the balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon and GH, which may result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia which occurs during octreotide acetate injection therapy is usually mild but may result in overt diabetes mellitus or necessitate dose changes in insulin or other anti-diabetic agents. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred on octreotide acetate injection in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Severe hyperglycemia, subsequent pneumonia, and death following initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy was reported in one patient with no history of hyperglycemia. Monitor glucose levels during octreotide acetate injection therapy. Adjust dosing of insulin or other anti-diabetic therapy accordingly. 5.4 Thyroid Function Abnormalities Octreotide suppresses secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which may result in hypothyroidism. Baseline and periodic assessment of thyroid function (TSH, total, and/or free T4) is recommended during chronic therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.5 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration and loose stools have been reported in patients receiving somatostatin analogs, including octreotide acetate. Somatostatin analogs reversibly inhibit secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile acids, which may result in malabsorption of dietary fats and subsequent symptoms of steatorrhea, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported in patients receiving octreotide acetate, evaluate patients for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and manage accordingly 5.6 Changes in Vitamin B 12 Levels Depressed vitamin B 12 levels and abnormal Schilling\u2019s tests have been observed in some patients receiving octreotide acetate injection therapy, and monitoring of vitamin B 12 levels is recommended during octreotide acetate injection therapy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Complete Atrioventricular Block [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Thyroid Function Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) Changes in Vitamin B 12 Levels [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) in patients with acromegaly are gallbladder abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, abdominal discomfort, hyperglycemia, and hypothyroidism. In other patients, most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) are gallbladder abnormalities. ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gland Pharma Limited at 864-879-9994 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Gallbladder Abnormalities Gallbladder abnormalities, especially stones and/or biliary sludge, frequently develop in patients on chronic octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. Cardiac In acromegalics, sinus bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias developed in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Gastrointestinal Diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, and abdominal discomfort were each seen in 34% to 61% of acromegalic patients in U.S. studies. 2.6% of the patients discontinued therapy due to these symptoms. These symptoms were seen in 5% to 10% of patients with carcinoid tumors and VIPomas. The frequency of these symptoms was not dose related, but diarrhea and abdominal discomfort generally resolved more quickly in patients treated with 300 mcg/day than in those treated with 750 mcg/day. Vomiting, flatulence, abnormal stools, abdominal distention, and constipation were each seen in less than 10% of patients. In rare instances, gastrointestinal side effects may resemble acute intestinal obstruction, with progressive abdominal distension, severe epigastric pain, abdominal tenderness, and guarding. Hypo/Hyperglycemia Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively, but only in about 1.5% of other patients. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were noted in approximately 2% of patients. Hypothyroidism In acromegalics, biochemical hypothyroidism alone occurred in 12% while goiter occurred in 8% and 4% required initiation of thyroid replacement therapy during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In patients without acromegaly, hypothyroidism has only been reported in several isolated patients and goiter has not been reported. Other Adverse Events Pain on injection was reported in 7.7%, headache in 6%, and dizziness in 5%. Pancreatitis was also observed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Other Adverse Events 1% to 4% Other events, each observed in 1% to 4% of patients, included fatigue, weakness, pruritus, joint pain, backache, urinary tract infection, cold symptoms, flu symptoms, injection site hematoma, bruise, edema, flushing, blurred vision, pollakiuria, fat malabsorption, hair loss, visual disturbance, and depression. Anaphylactoid reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported in several patients receiving octreotide acetate injection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of octreotide acetate injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary : cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cholangitis and pancreatitis, which have sometimes required cholecystectomy Gastrointestinal : intestinal obstruction, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency Hematologic : thrombocytopenia"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The following drugs require monitoring and possible dose adjustment when used with octreotide acetate injection : cyclosporine, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, beta-blockers, and bromocriptine. ( 7 ) Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection : Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Cyclosporine Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. Concomitant administration of octreotide acetate injection with cyclosporine may decrease blood levels of cyclosporine and result in transplant rejection. 7.2 Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Drugs Octreotide inhibits the secretion of insulin and glucagon. Therefore, blood glucose levels should be monitored when octreotide acetate injection treatment is initiated or when the dose is altered and anti-diabetic treatment should be adjusted accordingly. 7.3 Bromocriptine Concomitant administration of octreotide and bromocriptine increases the availability of bromocriptine. 7.4 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy Concomitant administration of bradycardia-inducing drugs (e.g., beta-blockers) may have an additive effect on the reduction of heart rate associated with octreotide. Dose adjustments of concomitant medication may be necessary. Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. 7.5 Drug Metabolism Interactions Limited published data indicate that somatostatin analogs might decrease the metabolic clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which may be due to the suppression of GH. Since it cannot be excluded that octreotide may have this effect, other drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and which have a low therapeutic index (e.g., quinidine, terfenadine) should therefore be used with caution. 7.6 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection Octreotide competitively binds to somatostatin receptors and may interfere with the efficacy of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited data with octreotide acetate injection in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental-effects were observed with IV administration of octreotide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 7- and 13-times, respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.5 mg/day based on body surface area (BSA). Transient growth retardation, with no impact on postnatal development, was observed in rat offspring from a pre- and post-natal study of octreotide at IV doses below the MRHD based on BSA (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In postmarketing data, a limited number of exposed pregnancies have been reported in patients with acromegaly. Most women were exposed to octreotide during the first trimester of pregnancy at doses ranging from 100 to 300 mcg/day of octreotide acetate injection or 20 mg to 30 mg once a month of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, however some women elected to continue octreotide therapy throughout pregnancy. In cases with a known outcome, no congenital malformations were reported. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received IV doses of octreotide up to 1 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. A slight reduction in body weight gain was noted in pregnant rats at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day. There were no maternal effects in rabbits or embryo-fetal effects in either species up to the maximum dose tested. At 1 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, the dose multiple was approximately 7- and 13-times, respectively, at the highest recommended human dose of 1.5 mg/day based on BSA. In a pre- and post-natal development rat study at IV doses of 0.02 to 1 mg/kg/day, a transient growth retardation of the offspring was observed at all doses which was possibly a consequence of GH inhibition by octreotide. The doses attributed to the delayed growth are below the human dose of 1.5 mg/day, based on BSA. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of octreotide acetate injection in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies show that octreotide administered subcutaneously passes into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk ( see Data ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for octreotide acetate injection, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from octreotide acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Following a subcutaneous dose (1 mg/kg) of octreotide to lactating rats, transfer of octreotide into milk was observed at a low concentration compared to plasma (milk/plasma ratio of 0.009). 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as the therapeutic benefits of a reduction in GH levels and normalization of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration in acromegalic females treated with octreotide may lead to improved fertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of octreotide acetate injection in the pediatric population have not been demonstrated. No formal controlled clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of octreotide acetate injection in pediatric patients under age 6 years. In postmarketing reports, serious adverse events, including hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death, have been reported with octreotide acetate injection use in children, most notably in children under 2 years of age. The relationship of these events to octreotide has not been established as the majority of these pediatric patients had serious underlying co-morbid conditions. The efficacy and safety of octreotide acetate injection using the octreotide acetate for injectable suspension formulation was examined in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6 month pharmacokinetics study in 60 pediatric patients age 6 to 17 years with hypothalamic obesity resulting from cranial insult. The mean octreotide concentration after 6 doses of 40 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by intramuscular (IM) injection every 4 weeks was approximately 3 ng/mL. Steady-state concentrations was achieved after 3 injections of a 40-mg dose. Mean body mass index (BMI) increased 0.1 kg/m 2 in octreotide acetate for injectable suspension-treated subjects compared to 0.0 kg/m 2 in saline control-treated subjects. Efficacy was not demonstrated. Diarrhea occurred in 11 of 30 (37%) patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. No unexpected adverse events were observed. However, with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adult indications such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was 10 mg to 30 mg once a month. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of octreotide acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, the half-life of octreotide acetate may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment-Cirrhotic Patients In patients with liver cirrhosis, the half-life of the drug may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Octreotide acetate injection, a cyclic octapeptide prepared as a clear sterile solution of octreotide, acetate salt, in a buffered lactic acid solution for administration by deep subcutaneous or IV injection. Octreotide acetate, known chemically as L-Cysteinamide, D-phenylalanyl-L-cysteinyl-L-phenylalanyl-D-tryptophyl-L-lysyl-L-threonyl-N-[2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)propyl]-,cyclic (2 \u2192 7)-disulfide; [R-(R*, R*)] acetate salt, is a long-acting octapeptide with pharmacologic actions mimicking those of the natural hormone somatostatin. Octreotide acetate injection is available as sterile 5 mL multi-dose vials in 2 strengths, containing 200 mcg or 1000 mcg octreotide (as acetate). Each mL of multi-dose vials also contains lactic acid, USP (3.4 mg), mannitol, USP (45 mg), phenol, USP (5.0 mg), sodium bicarbonate, USP (quantity sufficient to pH 4.2 \u00b1 0.3), water for injection, USP (quantity sufficient to 1 mL). Lactic acid and sodium bicarbonate are added to provide a buffered solution, pH to 4.2 \u00b1 0.3. The molecular weight of octreotide acetate is 1019.3 g/mol (free peptide, C 49 H 66 N 10 O 10 S 2 ) and its amino acid sequence is: octreotide-spl-structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Octreotide acetate injection exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin. It is an even more potent inhibitor of GH, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it also suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, VIP, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide. By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and VIP secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Octreotide substantially reduces GH and/or IGF-1 (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly. Single doses of octreotide have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Octreotide suppresses secretion of TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection, octreotide is absorbed rapidly and completely from the injection site. Peak concentrations of 5.2 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) were reached 0.4 hours after dosing. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, IV and subcutaneous doses were found to be bioequivalent. Peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) values were dose proportional after IV single doses up to 200 mcg and subcutaneous single doses up to 500 mcg and after subcutaneous multiple doses up to 500 mcg 3 times a day (1,500 mcg/day). In patients with acromegaly, a mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing. Distribution In healthy volunteers, the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (t\u03b1\u00bd = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (Vdss) was estimated to be 13.6 L, and the total body clearance ranged from 7 L/hr to 10 L/hr. In blood, the distribution into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner. Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. In patients with acromegaly, the volume of distribution (Vdss) was estimated to be 21.6 \u00b1 8.5 L, and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h. The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%. Elimination The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 to 1.9 hours compared with 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone. The duration of action of octreotide acetate injection is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor. About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine. In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug. In patients with acromegaly, the disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normal subjects. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR 40 to 60 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 2.4 hours and total body clearance was 8.8 L/hr, in moderate impairment (CL CR 10 to 39 mL/min) t 1/2 was 3.0 hours and total body clearance 7.3 L/hr. In patients with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis (CL CR < 10 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 3.1 hours and total body clearance was 7.6 L/hr. In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, total body clearance was reduced to about half that found in healthy subjects (from approximately 10 L/hr to 4.5 L/hr). Hepatic Impairment Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide t 1/2 increasing to 3.7 hr and total body clearance decreasing to 5.9 L/hr, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed t 1/2 increased to 3.4 hr and total body clearance of 8.2 L/hr. 12.6 Immunogenicity Evaluation of 20 patients treated for at least 6 months has failed to demonstrate titers of antibodies exceeding background levels. However, antibody titers to octreotide acetate injection were subsequently reported in 3 patients and resulted in prolonged duration of drug action in 2 patients."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated no mutagenic potential of octreotide acetate injection. No carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in mice treated subcutaneously for 85 to 99 weeks at doses up to 2,000 mcg/kg/day (8 x the human exposure based on BSA). In a 116-week subcutaneous study in rats, a 27% and 12% incidence of injection-site sarcomas or squamous cell carcinomas was observed in males and females, respectively, at the highest dose level of 1,250 mcg/kg/day (10 x the human exposure based on BSA) compared to an incidence of 8% to 10% in the vehicle-control groups. The increased incidence of injection-site tumors was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to repeated subcutaneous injections at the same site. Rotating injection sites would prevent chronic irritation in humans. There have been no reports of injection-site tumors in patients treated with octreotide acetate for up to 5 years. There was also a 15% incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas in the 1,250 mcg/kg/day females compared to 7% in the saline-control females and 0% in the vehicle-control females. The presence of endometritis coupled with the absence of corpora lutea, the reduction in mammary fibroadenomas, and the presence of uterine dilatation suggest that the uterine tumors were associated with estrogen dominance in the aged female rats which does not occur in humans. Octreotide did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 1,000 mcg/kg/day, which represents 7-times the human exposure based on BSA."

In a 116-week subcutaneous study in rats, a 27% and 12% incidence of injection-site sarcomas or squamous cell carcinomas was observed in males and females, respectively, at the highest dose level of 1,250 mcg/kg/day (10 x the human exposure based on BSA) compared to an incidence of 8% to 10% in the vehicle-control groups. The increased incidence of injection-site tumors was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to repeated subcutaneous injections at the same site. Rotating injection sites would prevent chronic irritation in humans. There have been no reports of injection-site tumors in patients treated with octreotide acetate for up to 5 years. There was also a 15% incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas in the 1,250 mcg/kg/day females compared to 7% in the saline-control females and 0% in the vehicle-control females. The presence of endometritis coupled with the absence of corpora lutea, the reduction in mammary fibroadenomas, and the presence of uterine dilatation suggest that the uterine tumors were associated with estrogen dominance in the aged female rats which does not occur in humans. Octreotide did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 1,000 mcg/kg/day, which represents 7-times the human exposure based on BSA."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Acromegaly : Recommended initial octreotide acetate injection dosage is 50 mcg three times daily during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. Maintenance dose 100 mcg to 500 mcg three times daily. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Carcinoid Tumors : Recommended dosage range of 100 mcg to 600 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 VIPomas : Recommended dosage range of 200 mcg to 300 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Dosage and Administration Overview \u2022 Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. Pain with subcutaneous administration may be reduced by using the smallest volume that will deliver the desired dose. Sites should be rotated in a systematic manner. The needle shield of the prefilled syringes may contain natural rubber latex which may cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. \u2022 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if particulates and/or discoloration are observed. Octreotide acetate injection is not compatible in Total Parenteral Nutrition solutions because of the formation of a glycosyl octreotide conjugate which may decrease the efficacy of the product. \u2022 Octreotide acetate injection may be diluted in volumes of 50 mL to 200 mL and infused intravenously over 15 to 30 minutes or administered by intravenous (IV) push over 3 minutes. In emergency situations (e.g., carcinoid crisis), it may be given by rapid bolus. Discard unused portion. \u2022 Assess total and/or free T4 levels at baseline and periodically during chronic octreotide acetate injection therapy. 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Acromegaly The recommended initial dosage of octreotide acetate injection is 50 mcg three times daily to be administered subcutaneously. Increase octreotide acetate injection dose based upon GH or IGF-1 levels. The goal is to achieve GH levels less than 5 ng/mL or IGF-1 levels within normal range. Monitor GH or IGF-1 every two weeks after initiating octreotide acetate injection therapy or with dosage change, and to guide titration. The most common dosage is 100 mcg three times daily, but some patients require up to 500 mcg three times daily for maximum effectiveness. Doses greater than 300 mcg/day seldom result in additional biochemical benefit, and if an increase in dose fails to provide additional benefit, the dose should be reduced. Octreotide acetate injection should be withdrawn yearly for approximately 4 weeks from patients who have received irradiation to assess disease activity. If GH or IGF-1 levels increase and signs and symptoms recur, octreotide acetate injection therapy may be resumed. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Carcinoid Tumors The recommended daily dosage of octreotide acetate injection during the first 2 weeks of therapy ranges from 100 to 600 mcg/day in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously (mean daily dosage is 300 mcg). In the clinical studies, the median daily maintenance dosage was approximately 450 mcg, but clinical and biochemical benefits were obtained in some patients with as little as 50 mcg, while others required doses up to 1500 mcg/day. However, experience with doses above 750 mcg/day is limited. Measurement of urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, plasma serotonin, plasma Substance P may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy. 2.4 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors Daily dosages of 200 mcg to 300 mcg in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously are recommended during the initial 2 weeks of therapy (range, 150 mcg to 750 mcg) to control symptoms of the disease. On an individual basis, dosage may be adjusted to achieve a therapeutic response, but usually doses above 450 mcg/day are not required. Measurement of Plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Cardiac Function Abnormalities : Increased risk for higher degree of atrioventricular blocks. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving Octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Bradycardia, arrhythmias, or conduction abnormalities may occur. Use with caution in at-risk patients. Dosage adjustment of cardiac medications may be necessary. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis : Monitor periodically. Discontinue if complications of cholelithiasis are suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Glucose Metabolism : Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia may occur. Glucose monitoring is recommended and anti-diabetic treatment may need adjustment. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Thyroid Function : Hypothyroidism may occur. Monitor thyroid levels periodically. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats: New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss may occur. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported, evaluate for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Cardiac Function Abnormalities Complete Atrioventricular Block Patients who receive octreotide acetate injection intravenously may be at increased risk for higher degree atrioventricular blocks. In postmarketing reports, complete atrioventricular block was reported in patients receiving IV octreotide acetate injection during surgical procedures. In the majority of patients, octreotide acetate injection was given at higher than recommended doses and/or as a continuous IV infusion. The safety of continuous IV infusion has not been established in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection for the approved indications. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Other Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities Other cardiac conduction abnormalities have occurred during treatment with octreotide acetate injection. In acromegalic patients, bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias occurred in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Other electrocardiogram (ECG) changes observed included QT prolongation, axis shifts, early repolarization, low voltage, R/S transition, and early R-wave progression. These ECG changes are not uncommon in acromegalic patients. Dose adjustments in drugs such as beta-blockers that have bradycardia effects may be necessary. In one acromegalic patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy resulted in worsening of CHF with improvement when drug was discontinued. Confirmation of a drug effect was obtained with a positive rechallenge. 5.2 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis Octreotide acetate injection may inhibit gallbladder contractility and decrease bile secretion, which may lead to gallbladder abnormalities or sludge. Acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, biliary obstruction, cholestatic hepatitis, or pancreatitis have been reported with octreotide acetate injection therapy. In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. One patient developed ascending cholangitis during octreotide acetate injection therapy and died. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue octreotide acetate injection and treat appropriately. 5.3 Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia Octreotide acetate injection alters the balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon and GH, which may result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia which occurs during octreotide acetate injection therapy is usually mild but may result in overt diabetes mellitus or necessitate dose changes in insulin or other anti-diabetic agents. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred on octreotide acetate injection in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Severe hyperglycemia, subsequent pneumonia, and death following initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy was reported in one patient with no history of hyperglycemia. Monitor glucose levels during octreotide acetate injection therapy. Adjust dosing of insulin or other anti-diabetic therapy accordingly. 5.4 Thyroid Function Abnormalities Octreotide suppresses secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which may result in hypothyroidism. Baseline and periodic assessment of thyroid function (TSH, total, and/or free T4) is recommended during chronic therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.5 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration and loose stools have been reported in patients receiving somatostatin analogs, including octreotide acetate injection. Somatostatin analogs reversibly inhibit secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile acids, which may result in malabsorption of dietary fats and subsequent symptoms of steatorrhea, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection, evaluate patients for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and manage accordingly . 5.6 Changes in Vitamin B12 Levels Depressed vitamin B12 levels and abnormal Schilling\u2019s tests have been observed in some patients receiving octreotide acetate injection therapy, and monitoring of vitamin B12 levels is recommended during octreotide acetate injection therapy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Complete Atrioventricular Block [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Thyroid Function Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Changes in Vitamin B12 Levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) in patients with acromegaly are gallbladder abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, abdominal discomfort, hyperglycemia, and hypothyroidism. In other patients, most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) are gallbladder abnormalities. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Gallbladder Abnormalities Gallbladder abnormalities, especially stones and/or biliary sludge, frequently develop in patients on chronic octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. Cardiac In acromegalics, sinus bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias developed in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Gastrointestinal Diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, and abdominal discomfort were each seen in 34% to 61% of acromegalic patients in U.S. studies. 2.6% of the patients discontinued therapy due to these symptoms. These symptoms were seen in 5% to 10% of patients with carcinoid tumors and VIPomas. The frequency of these symptoms was not dose related, but diarrhea and abdominal discomfort generally resolved more quickly in patients treated with 300 mcg/day than in those treated with 750 mcg/day. Vomiting, flatulence, abnormal stools, abdominal distention, and constipation were each seen in less than 10% of patients. In rare instances, gastrointestinal side effects may resemble acute intestinal obstruction, with progressive abdominal distension, severe epigastric pain, abdominal tenderness, and guarding. Hypo/Hyperglycemia Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively, but only in about 1.5% of other patients. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were noted in approximately 2% of patients. Hypothyroidism In acromegalics, biochemical hypothyroidism alone occurred in 12% while goiter occurred in 8% and 4% required initiation of thyroid replacement therapy during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In patients without acromegaly, hypothyroidism has only been reported in several isolated patients and goiter has not been reported. Other Adverse Events Pain on injection was reported in 7.7%, headache in 6%, and dizziness in 5%. Pancreatitis was also observed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Other Adverse Events 1% to 4% Other events, each observed in 1% to 4% of patients, included fatigue, weakness, pruritus, joint pain, backache, urinary tract infection, cold symptoms, flu symptoms, injection site hematoma, bruise, edema, flushing, blurred vision, pollakiuria, fat malabsorption, hair loss, visual disturbance, and depression. Anaphylactoid reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported in several patients receiving octreotide acetate injection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of octreotide acetate injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary : cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cholangitis and pancreatitis, which have sometimes required cholecystectomy Gastrointestinal : intestinal obstruction, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency Hematologic : thrombocytopenia"

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 The following drugs require monitoring and possible dose adjustment when used with octreotide acetate injection : cyclosporine, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, beta-blockers, and bromocriptine. ( 7 ) \u2022 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection : Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Cyclosporine Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. Concomitant administration of octreotide acetate injection with cyclosporine may decrease blood levels of cyclosporine and result in transplant rejection. 7.2 Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Drugs Octreotide inhibits the secretion of insulin and glucagon. Therefore, blood glucose levels should be monitored when octreotide acetate injection treatment is initiated or when the dose is altered and anti-diabetic treatment should be adjusted accordingly. 7.3 Bromocriptine Concomitant administration of octreotide and bromocriptine increases the availability of bromocriptine. 7.4 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy Concomitant administration of bradycardia-inducing drugs (e.g., beta-blockers) may have an additive effect on the reduction of heart rate associated with octreotide. Dose adjustments of concomitant medication may be necessary. Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. 7.5 Drug Metabolism Interactions Limited published data indicate that somatostatin analogs might decrease the metabolic clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which may be due to the suppression of GH. Since it cannot be excluded that octreotide may have this effect, other drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and which have a low therapeutic index (e.g., quinidine, terfenadine) should therefore be used with caution. 7.6 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection Octreotide competitively binds to somatostatin receptors and may interfere with the efficacy of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited data with octreotide acetate injection in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental-effects were observed with IV administration of octreotide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 7- and 13-times, respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.5 mg/day based on body surface area (BSA). Transient growth retardation, with no impact on postnatal development, was observed in rat offspring from a pre- and post-natal study of octreotide at IV doses below the MRHD based on BSA (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In postmarketing data, a limited number of exposed pregnancies have been reported in patients with acromegaly. Most women were exposed to octreotide during the first trimester of pregnancy at doses ranging from 100 to 300 mcg/day of octreotide acetate injection or 20 mg to 30 mg once a month of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, however some women elected to continue octreotide therapy throughout pregnancy. In cases with a known outcome, no congenital malformations were reported. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received IV doses of octreotide up to 1 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. A slight reduction in body weight gain was noted in pregnant rats at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day. There were no maternal effects in rabbits or embryo-fetal effects in either species up to the maximum dose tested. At 1 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, the dose multiple was approximately 7- and 13-times, respectively, at the highest recommended human dose of 1.5 mg/day based on BSA. In a pre- and post-natal development rat study at IV doses of 0.02-1 mg/kg/day, a transient growth retardation of the offspring was observed at all doses which was possibly a consequence of GH inhibition by octreotide. The doses attributed to the delayed growth are below the human dose of 1.5 mg/day, based on BSA. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of octreotide acetate injection in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies show that octreotide administered subcutaneously passes into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk (see Data ) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for octreotide acetate injection, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from octreotide acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Following a subcutaneous dose (1 mg/kg) of octreotide to lactating rats, transfer of octreotide into milk was observed at a low concentration compared to plasma (milk/plasma ratio of 0.009). 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as the therapeutic benefits of a reduction in GH levels and normalization of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration in acromegalic females treated with octreotide may lead to improved fertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of octreotide acetate injection in the pediatric population have not been demonstrated. No formal controlled clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of octreotide acetate injection in pediatric patients under age 6 years. In postmarketing reports, serious adverse events, including hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death, have been reported with octreotide acetate injection use in children, most notably in children under 2 years of age. The relationship of these events to octreotide has not been established as the majority of these pediatric patients had serious underlying co-morbid conditions. The efficacy and safety of octreotide acetate injection using the octreotide acetate for injectable suspension formulation was examined in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6 month pharmacokinetics study in 60 pediatric patients age 6 to 17 years with hypothalamic obesity resulting from cranial insult. The mean octreotide concentration after 6 doses of 40 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by intramuscular (IM) injection every 4 weeks was approximately 3 ng/mL. Steady-state concentrations were achieved after 3 injections of a 40-mg dose. Mean body mass index (BMI) increased 0.1 kg/m 2 in octreotide acetate for injectable suspension-treated subjects compared to 0.0 kg/m 2 in saline control-treated subjects. Efficacy was not demonstrated. Diarrhea occurred in 11 of 30 (37%) patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. No unexpected adverse events were observed. However, with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adult indications such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was 10 mg to 30 mg once a month. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of octreotide acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, the half-life of octreotide acetate injection may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment-Cirrhotic Patients In patients with liver cirrhosis, the half-life of the drug may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited data with octreotide acetate injection in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental-effects were observed with IV administration of octreotide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 7- and 13-times, respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.5 mg/day based on body surface area (BSA). Transient growth retardation, with no impact on postnatal development, was observed in rat offspring from a pre- and post-natal study of octreotide at IV doses below the MRHD based on BSA (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In postmarketing data, a limited number of exposed pregnancies have been reported in patients with acromegaly. Most women were exposed to octreotide during the first trimester of pregnancy at doses ranging from 100 to 300 mcg/day of octreotide acetate injection or 20 mg to 30 mg once a month of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, however some women elected to continue octreotide therapy throughout pregnancy. In cases with a known outcome, no congenital malformations were reported. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received IV doses of octreotide up to 1 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. A slight reduction in body weight gain was noted in pregnant rats at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day. There were no maternal effects in rabbits or embryo-fetal effects in either species up to the maximum dose tested. At 1 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, the dose multiple was approximately 7- and 13-times, respectively, at the highest recommended human dose of 1.5 mg/day based on BSA.

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Octreotide acetate injection, a cyclic octapeptide prepared as a clear sterile solution of octreotide, acetate salt, in a buffered lactic acid solution for administration by deep subcutaneous or intravenous (IV) injection. Octreotide acetate, known chemically as D-Phenylalanyl-L-cysteinyl-L-phenylalanyl-D-tryptophyl-L-lysyl-L-threonyl-N-[(1R,2R)-2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)propyl]-L-cysteinamidecyclic(2--7)-disulfide acetate salt, is a long-acting octapeptide with pharmacologic actions mimicking those of the natural hormone somatostatin. Octreotide acetate injection is available as sterile 1-mL syringes in 3 strengths, with each mL containing 50 mcg, 100 mcg, or 500 mcg octreotide (as acetate) and also contains L-lactic acid 3 mg, sodium chloride 7 mg, sodium hydroxide to adjust pH, and water for injection, q.s. L-Lactic acid and sodium hydroxide are added to provide a buffered solution, pH range 3.9 to 4.5. The molecular weight of octreotide acetate is 1019.3 g/mol (free peptide, C 49 H 66 N 10 O 10 S 2 ) and its amino acid sequence is: Octreotide Acetate Amino Acid Sequence"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Octreotide acetate injection exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin. It is an even more potent inhibitor of GH, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it also suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, VIP, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide. By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and VIP secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Octreotide substantially reduces GH and/or IGF-1 (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly. Single doses of octreotide have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Octreotide suppresses secretion of TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection, octreotide is absorbed rapidly and completely from the injection site. Peak concentrations of 5.2 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) were reached 0.4 hours after dosing. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, IV and subcutaneous doses were found to be bioequivalent. Peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) values were dose proportional after IV single doses up to 200 mcg and subcutaneous single doses up to 500 mcg and after subcutaneous multiple doses up to 500 mcg 3 times a day (1,500 mcg/day). In patients with acromegaly, a mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing. Distribution In healthy volunteers, the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (t\u03b1\u00bd = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 13.6 L, and the total body clearance ranged from 7 L/hr to 10 L/hr. In blood, the distribution into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner. Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. In patients with acromegaly, the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 21.6 \u00b1 8.5 L, and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h. The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%. Elimination The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 to 1.9 hours compared with 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone. The duration of action of octreotide acetate injection is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor. About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine. In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug. In patients with acromegaly, the disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normal subjects. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR 40 to 60 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 2.4 hours and total body clearance was 8.8 L/hr, in moderate impairment (CL CR 10 to 39 mL/min) t 1/2 was 3.0 hours and total body clearance 7.3 L/hr. In patients with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis (CL CR < 10 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 3.1 hours and total body clearance was 7.6 L/hr. In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, total body clearance was reduced to about half that found in healthy subjects (from approximately 10 L/hr to 4.5 L/hr). Hepatic Impairment Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide t 1/2 increasing to 3.7 hr and total body clearance decreasing to 5.9 L/hr, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed t 1/2 increased to 3.4 hr and total body clearance of 8.2 L/hr. 12.6 Immunogenicity Evaluation of 20 patients treated for at least 6 months has failed to demonstrate titers of antibodies exceeding background levels. However, antibody titers to octreotide acetate injection were subsequently reported in 3 patients and resulted in prolonged duration of drug action in 2 patients."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated no mutagenic potential of octreotide acetate injection. No carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in mice treated subcutaneously for 85 to 99 weeks at doses up to 2,000 mcg/kg/day (8 x the human exposure based on BSA). In a 116-week subcutaneous study in rats, a 27% and 12% incidence of injection-site sarcomas or squamous cell carcinomas was observed in males and females, respectively, at the highest dose level of 1,250 mcg/kg/day (10 x the human exposure based on BSA) compared to an incidence of 8% to 10% in the vehicle-control groups. The increased incidence of injection-site tumors was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to repeated subcutaneous injections at the same site. Rotating injection sites would prevent chronic irritation in humans. There have been no reports of injection-site tumors in patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for up to 5 years. There was also a 15% incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas in the 1,250 mcg/kg/day females compared to 7% in the saline-control females and 0% in the vehicle-control females. The presence of endometritis coupled with the absence of corpora lutea, the reduction in mammary fibroadenomas, and the presence of uterine dilatation suggest that the uterine tumors were associated with estrogen dominance in the aged female rats which does not occur in humans. Octreotide did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 1,000 mcg/kg/day, which represents 7-times the human exposure based on BSA."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Octreotide acetate injection is a somatostatin analogue indicated: \u2022 Acromegaly : To reduce blood levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1; somatomedin C) in acromegaly patients who have had inadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgical resection, pituitary irradiation, and bromocriptine mesylate at maximally tolerated doses. ( 1.1 ) \u2022 Carcinoid Tumors : For the symptomatic treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors where it suppresses or inhibits the severe diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with the disease. ( 1.2 ) \u2022 Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors (VIPomas) : For the treatment of profuse watery diarrhea associated with VIP-secreting tumors. ( 1.3 ) Limitations of Use Improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, or reduction in tumor size or rate of growth, were not shown in clinical trials performed with octreotide acetate injection; these trials were not optimally designed to detect such effects. ( 1.4 ) 1.1 Acromegaly Octreotide acetate injection is indicated to reduce blood levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1; somatomedin C) in acromegaly patients who have had inadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgical resection, pituitary irradiation, and bromocriptine mesylate at maximally tolerated doses. 1.2 Carcinoid Tumors Octreotide acetate injection is indicated for treatment of severe diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors. 1.3 Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors Octreotide acetate injection is indicated for the treatment of the profuse watery diarrhea associated with vasoactive intestinal peptide tumors (VIPomas)-secreting tumors. 1.4 Important Limitations of Use Improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, or reduction in tumor size or rate of growth, were not shown in clinical trials performed with octreotide acetate injection; these trials were not optimally designed to detect such effects."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Acromegaly : Recommended initial octreotide acetate dosage is 50 mcg three times daily during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. Maintenance dose 100 mcg to 500 mcg three times daily. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Carcinoid Tumors : Recommended dosage range of 100 mcg to 600 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 VIPomas : Recommended dosage range of 200 mcg to 300 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Dosage and Administration Overview \u2022 Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. Pain with subcutaneous administration may be reduced by using the smallest volume that will deliver the desired dose. Sites should be rotated in a systematic manner. \u2022 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if particulates and/or discoloration are observed. Octreotide acetate injection is not compatible in Total Parenteral Nutrition solutions because of the formation of a glycosyl octreotide conjugate which may decrease the efficacy of the product. \u2022 Octreotide acetate injection may be diluted in volumes of 50 mL to 200 mL and infused intravenously over 15 to 30 minutes or administered by intravenous (IV) push over 3 minutes. In emergency situations (e.g., carcinoid crisis), it may be given by rapid bolus. \u2022 Assess total and/or free T4 levels at baseline and periodically during chronic octreotide acetate therapy. 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Acromegaly The recommended initial dosage of octreotide acetate is 50 mcg three times daily to be administered subcutaneously. Increase octreotide acetate dose based upon GH or IGF-1 levels. The goal is to achieve GH levels less than 5 ng/mL or IGF-1 levels within normal range. Monitor GH or IGF-1 every two weeks after initiating octreotide acetate therapy or with dosage change, and to guide titration. The most common dosage is 100 mcg three times daily, but some patients require up to 500 mcg three times daily for maximum effectiveness. Doses greater than 300 mcg/day seldom result in additional biochemical benefit, and if an increase in dose fails to provide additional benefit, the dose should be reduced. Octreotide acetate injection should be withdrawn yearly for approximately 4 weeks from patients who have received irradiation to assess disease activity. If GH or IGF-1 levels increase and signs and symptoms recur, octreotide acetate injection therapy may be resumed. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Carcinoid Tumors The recommended daily dosage of octreotide acetate injection during the first 2 weeks of therapy ranges from 100 to 600 mcg/day in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously (mean daily dosage is 300 mcg). In the clinical studies, the median daily maintenance dosage was approximately 450 mcg, but clinical and biochemical benefits were obtained in some patients with as little as 50 mcg, while others required doses up to 1500 mcg/day. However, experience with doses above 750 mcg/day is limited. Measurement of urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, plasma serotonin, plasma Substance P may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy. 2.4 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors Daily dosages of 200 mcg to 300 mcg in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously are recommended during the initial 2 weeks of therapy (range, 150 mcg to 750 mcg) to control symptoms of the disease. On an individual basis, dosage may be adjusted to achieve a therapeutic response, but usually doses above 450 mcg/day are not required. Measurement of Plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Cardiac Function Abnormalities : Increased risk for higher degree of atrioventricular blocks. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Bradycardia, arrhythmias, or conduction abnormalities may occur. Use with caution in at-risk patients. Dosage adjustment of cardiac medications may be necessary. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis : Monitor periodically. Discontinue if complications of cholelithiasis are suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Glucose Metabolism : Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia may occur. Glucose monitoring is recommended and anti-diabetic treatment may need adjustment. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Thyroid Function : Hypothyroidism may occur. Monitor thyroid levels periodically. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats : New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss may occur. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported, evaluate for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Cardiac Function Abnormalities Complete Atrioventricular Block Patients who receive octreotide acetate injection intravenously may be at increased risk for higher degree atrioventricular blocks. In postmarketing reports, complete atrioventricular block was reported in patients receiving IV octreotide acetate injection during surgical procedures. In the majority of patients, octreotide acetate injection was given at higher than recommended doses and/or as a continuous IV infusion. The safety of continuous IV infusion has not been established in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection for the approved indications. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Other Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities Other cardiac conduction abnormalities have occurred during treatment with octreotide acetate injection. In acromegalic patients, bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias occurred in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Other electrocardiogram (ECG) changes observed included QT prolongation, axis shifts, early repolarization, low voltage, R/S transition, and early R-wave progression. These ECG changes are not uncommon in acromegalic patients. Dose adjustments in drugs such as beta-blockers that have bradycardia effects may be necessary. In one acromegalic patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy resulted in worsening of CHF with improvement when drug was discontinued. Confirmation of a drug effect was obtained with a positive rechallenge. 5.2 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis Octreotide acetate injection may inhibit gallbladder contractility and decrease bile secretion, which may lead to gallbladder abnormalities or sludge. Acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, biliary obstruction, cholestatic hepatitis, or pancreatitis have been reported with octreotide acetate injection therapy. In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. One patient developed ascending cholangitis during octreotide acetate injection therapy and died. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue octreotide acetate injection and treat appropriately. 5.3 Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia Octreotide acetate injection alters the balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon and GH, which may result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia which occurs during octreotide acetate injection therapy is usually mild but may result in overt diabetes mellitus or necessitate dose changes in insulin or other anti-diabetic agents. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred on octreotide acetate injection in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Severe hyperglycemia, subsequent pneumonia, and death following initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy was reported in one patient with no history of hyperglycemia. Monitor glucose levels during octreotide acetate injection therapy. Adjust dosing of insulin or other anti-diabetic therapy accordingly. 5.4 Thyroid Function Abnormalities Octreotide suppresses secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which may result in hypothyroidism. Baseline and periodic assessment of thyroid function (TSH, total, and/or free T 4 ) is recommended during chronic therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.5 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration and loose stools have been reported in patients receiving somatostatin analogs, including octreotide acetate. Somatostatin analogs reversibly inhibit secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile acids, which may result in malabsorption of dietary fats and subsequent symptoms of steatorrhea, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported in patients receiving octreotide acetate, evaluate patients for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and manage accordingly. 5.6 Changes in Vitamin B12 Levels Depressed vitamin B12 levels and abnormal Schilling\u2019s tests have been observed in some patients receiving octreotide acetate injection therapy, and monitoring of vitamin B12 levels is recommended during octreotide acetate injection therapy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Complete Atrioventricular Block [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Thyroid Function Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Changes in Vitamin B12 Levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) in patients with acromegaly are gallbladder abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, abdominal discomfort, hyperglycemia, and hypothyroidism. In other patients, most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) are gallbladder abnormalities. ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA at 1 (888) 721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Gallbladder Abnormalities Gallbladder abnormalities, especially stones and/or biliary sludge, frequently develop in patients on chronic octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. Cardiac In acromegalics, sinus bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias developed in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Gastrointestinal Diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, and abdominal discomfort were each seen in 34% to 61% of acromegalic patients in U.S. studies. 2.6% of the patients discontinued therapy due to these symptoms. These symptoms were seen in 5% to 10% of patients with carcinoid tumors and VIPomas. The frequency of these symptoms was not dose related, but diarrhea and abdominal discomfort generally resolved more quickly in patients treated with 300 mcg/day than in those treated with 750 mcg/day. Vomiting, flatulence, abnormal stools, abdominal distention, and constipation were each seen in less than 10% of patients. In rare instances, gastrointestinal side effects may resemble acute intestinal obstruction, with progressive abdominal distension, severe epigastric pain, abdominal tenderness, and guarding. Hypo/Hyperglycemia Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively, but only in about 1.5% of other patients. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were noted in approximately 2% of patients. Hypothyroidism In acromegalics, biochemical hypothyroidism alone occurred in 12% while goiter occurred in 8% and 4% required initiation of thyroid replacement therapy during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. In patients without acromegaly, hypothyroidism has only been reported in several isolated patients and goiter has not been reported. Other Adverse Events Pain on injection was reported in 7.7%, headache in 6%, and dizziness in 5%. Pancreatitis was also observed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Other Adverse Events 1% to 4% Other events, each observed in 1% to 4% of patients, included fatigue, weakness, pruritus, joint pain, backache, urinary tract infection, cold symptoms, flu symptoms, injection site hematoma, bruise, edema, flushing, blurred vision, pollakiuria, fat malabsorption, hair loss, visual disturbance, and depression. Anaphylactoid reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported in several patients receiving octreotide acetate injection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of octreotide acetate injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary: cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cholangitis and pancreatitis, which have sometimes required cholecystectomy Gastrointestinal : intestinal obstruction, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency Hematologic: thrombocytopenia"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 The following drugs require monitoring and possible dose adjustment when used with octreotide acetate injection : cyclosporine, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, beta-blockers, and bromocriptine. ( 7 ) \u2022 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection : Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Cyclosporine Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. Concomitant administration of octreotide acetate injection with cyclosporine may decrease blood levels of cyclosporine and result in transplant rejection. 7.2 Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Drugs Octreotide inhibits the secretion of insulin and glucagon. Therefore, blood glucose levels should be monitored when octreotide acetate injection treatment is initiated or when the dose is altered and anti-diabetic treatment should be adjusted accordingly. 7.3 Bromocriptine Concomitant administration of octreotide and bromocriptine increases the availability of bromocriptine. 7.4 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy Concomitant administration of bradycardia-inducing drugs (e.g., beta-blockers) may have an additive effect on the reduction of heart rate associated with octreotide. Dose adjustments of concomitant medication may be necessary. Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. 7.5 Drug Metabolism Interactions Limited published data indicate that somatostatin analogs might decrease the metabolic clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which may be due to the suppression of GH. Since it cannot be excluded that octreotide may have this effect, other drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and which have a low therapeutic index (e.g., quinidine, terfenadine) should therefore be used with caution. 7.6 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection Octreotide competitively binds to somatostatin receptors and may interfere with the efficacy of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited data with octreotide acetate injection in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental-effects were observed with IV administration of octreotide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 7- and 13-times, respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.5 mg/day based on body surface area (BSA). Transient growth retardation, with no impact on postnatal development, was observed in rat offspring from a pre- and post-natal study of octreotide at IV doses below the MRHD based on BSA (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In postmarketing data, a limited number of exposed pregnancies have been reported in patients with acromegaly. Most women were exposed to octreotide during the first trimester of pregnancy at doses ranging from 100 to 300 mcg/day of octreotide acetate injection or 20 mg to 30 mg once a month of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, however some women elected to continue octreotide therapy throughout pregnancy. In cases with a known outcome, no congenital malformations were reported. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received IV doses of octreotide up to 1 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. A slight reduction in body weight gain was noted in pregnant rats at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day. There were no maternal effects in rabbits or embryo-fetal effects in either species up to the maximum dose tested. At 1 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, the dose multiple was approximately 7- and 13-times, respectively, at the highest recommended human dose of 1.5 mg/day based on BSA. In a pre- and post-natal development rat study at IV doses of 0.02 to 1 mg/kg/day, a transient growth retardation of the offspring was observed at all doses which was possibly a consequence of GH inhibition by octreotide. The doses attributed to the delayed growth are below the human dose of 1.5 mg/day, based on BSA. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of octreotide acetate injection in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies show that octreotide administered subcutaneously passes into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk ( see Data ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for octreotide acetate injection, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from octreotide acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Following a subcutaneous dose (1 mg/kg) of octreotide to lactating rats, transfer of octreotide into milk was observed at a low concentration compared to plasma (milk/plasma ratio of 0.009). 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as the therapeutic benefits of a reduction in GH levels and normalization of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration in acromegalic females treated with octreotide may lead to improved fertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of octreotide acetate injection in the pediatric population have not been demonstrated. No formal controlled clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of octreotide acetate injection in pediatric patients under age 6 years. In postmarketing reports, serious adverse events, including hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death, have been reported with octreotide acetate injection use in children, most notably in children under 2 years of age. The relationship of these events to octreotide has not been established as the majority of these pediatric patients had serious underlying co-morbid conditions. The efficacy and safety of octreotide acetate injection using the octreotide acetate for injectable suspension formulation was examined in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6 month pharmacokinetics study in 60 pediatric patients age 6 to 17 years with hypothalamic obesity resulting from cranial insult. The mean octreotide concentration after 6 doses of 40 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by intramuscular (IM) injection every 4 weeks was approximately 3 ng/mL. Steady-state concentrations was achieved after 3 injections of a 40-mg dose. Mean body mass index (BMI) increased 0.1 kg/m 2 in octreotide acetate for injectable suspension-treated subjects compared to 0.0 kg/m 2 in saline control-treated subjects. Efficacy was not demonstrated. Diarrhea occurred in 11 of 30 (37%) patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. No unexpected adverse events were observed. However, with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adult indications such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was 10 mg to 30 mg once a month. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of octreotide acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, the half-life of octreotide acetate may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 8.7 Hepatic Impairment-Cirrhotic Patients In patients with liver cirrhosis, the half-life of the drug may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage.

Efficacy was not demonstrated. Diarrhea occurred in 11 of 30 (37%) patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. No unexpected adverse events were observed. However, with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adult indications such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was 10 mg to 30 mg once a month."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of octreotide acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A limited number of accidental overdoses of octreotide acetate injection in adults have been reported. In adults, the doses ranged from 2,400 to 6,000 mcg/day administered by continuous infusion (100 to 250 mcg/hour) or subcutaneously (1,500 mcg 3 times a day). Adverse events in some patients included arrhythmia, complete atrioventricular block, hypotension, cardiac arrest, brain hypoxia, pancreatitis, hepatitis steatosis, hepatomegaly, lactic acidosis, flushing, diarrhea, lethargy, weakness, and weight loss. If overdose occurs, symptomatic management is indicated. Up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose can often be obtained from the National Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Octreotide acetate injection, a cyclic octapeptide prepared as a clear sterile solution of octreotide, acetate salt, in a buffered lactic acid solution for administration by deep subcutaneous or IV injection. Octreotide acetate, known chemically as L-Cysteinamide, D-phenylalanyl-L-cysteinyl-L-phenylalanyl-D-tryptophyl-L-lysyl-L-threonyl-N-[2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)propyl]-,cyclic (2 \u2192 7)-disulfide; [R-(R*, R*)] acetate salt, is a long-acting octapeptide with pharmacologic actions mimicking those of the natural hormone somatostatin. Octreotide acetate injection is available as sterile 1 mL single-dose vials in 2 strengths containing 100 mcg or 500 mcg octreotide (as acetate). Each single-dose vial also contains lactic acid, USP (3.4 mg), mannitol, USP (45 mg), sodium bicarbonate, USP (quantity sufficient to pH 4.2 \u00b1 0.3), water for injection, USP (quantity sufficient to 1 mL). Lactic acid and sodium bicarbonate are added to provide a buffered solution, pH to 4.2 \u00b1 0.3. The molecular weight of octreotide acetate is 1019.3 g/mol (free peptide, C 49 H 66 N 10 O 10 S 2 ) and its amino acid sequence is: octreotide-spl-structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Octreotide acetate injection exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin. It is an even more potent inhibitor of GH, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it also suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, VIP, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide. By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and VIP secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Octreotide substantially reduces GH and/or IGF-1 (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly. Single doses of octreotide have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Octreotide suppresses secretion of TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection, octreotide is absorbed rapidly and completely from the injection site. Peak concentrations of 5.2 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) were reached 0.4 hours after dosing. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, IV and subcutaneous doses were found to be bioequivalent. Peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) values were dose proportional after IV single doses up to 200 mcg and subcutaneous single doses up to 500 mcg and after subcutaneous multiple doses up to 500 mcg 3 times a day (1,500 mcg/day). In patients with acromegaly, a mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing. Distribution In healthy volunteers, the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (t\u03b1\u00bd = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 13.6 L, and the total body clearance ranged from 7 L/hr to 10 L/hr. In blood, the distribution into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner. Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. In patients with acromegaly, the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 21.6 \u00b1 8.5 L, and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h. The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%. Elimination The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 to 1.9 hours compared with 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone. The duration of action of octreotide acetate injection is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor. About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine. In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug. In patients with acromegaly, the disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normal subjects. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR 40 to 60 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 2.4 hours and total body clearance was 8.8 L/hr, in moderate impairment (CL CR 10 to 39 mL/min) t 1/2 was 3.0 hours and total body clearance 7.3 L/hr. In patients with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis (CL CR < 10 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 3.1 hours and total body clearance was 7.6 L/hr. In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, total body clearance was reduced to about half that found in healthy subjects (from approximately 10 L/hr to 4.5 L/hr). Hepatic Impairment Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide t 1/2 increasing to 3.7 hr and total body clearance decreasing to 5.9 L/hr, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed t 1/2 increased to 3.4 hr and total body clearance of 8.2 L/hr. 12.6 Immunogenicity Evaluation of 20 patients treated for at least 6 months has failed to demonstrate titers of antibodies exceeding background levels. However, antibody titers to octreotide acetate injection were subsequently reported in 3 patients and resulted in prolonged duration of drug action in 2 patients."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated no mutagenic potential of octreotide acetate injection. No carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in mice treated subcutaneously for 85 to 99 weeks at doses up to 2,000 mcg/kg/day (8 x the human exposure based on BSA). In a 116-week subcutaneous study in rats, a 27% and 12% incidence of injection-site sarcomas or squamous cell carcinomas was observed in males and females, respectively, at the highest dose level of 1,250 mcg/kg/day (10 x the human exposure based on BSA) compared to an incidence of 8% to 10% in the vehicle-control groups. The increased incidence of injection-site tumors was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to repeated subcutaneous injections at the same site. Rotating injection sites would prevent chronic irritation in humans. There have been no reports of injection-site tumors in patients treated with octreotide acetate for up to 5 years. There was also a 15% incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas in the 1,250 mcg/kg/day females compared to 7% in the saline-control females and 0% in the vehicle-control females. The presence of endometritis coupled with the absence of corpora lutea, the reduction in mammary fibroadenomas, and the presence of uterine dilatation suggest that the uterine tumors were associated with estrogen dominance in the aged female rats which does not occur in humans. Octreotide did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 1,000 mcg/kg/day, which represents 7-times the human exposure based on BSA."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Octreotide Acetate Injection is a somatostatin analogue indicated: Acromegaly : To reduce blood levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1; somatomedin C) in acromegaly patients who have had inadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgical resection, pituitary irradiation, and bromocriptine mesylate at maximally tolerated doses. ( 1.1 ) Carcinoid Tumors : For the symptomatic treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors where it suppresses or inhibits the severe diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with the disease. ( 1.2 ) Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors (VIPomas) : For the treatment of profuse watery diarrhea associated with VIP-secreting tumors. ( 1.3 ) Limitations of Use Improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, or reduction in tumor size or rate of growth, were not shown in clinical trials performed with Octreotide Acetate Injection; these trials were not optimally designed to detect such effects. ( 1.4 ) 1.1 Acromegaly Octreotide Acetate Injection is indicated to reduce blood levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1; somatomedin C) in acromegaly patients who have had inadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgical resection, pituitary irradiation, and bromocriptine mesylate at maximally tolerated doses. 1.2 Carcinoid Tumors Octreotide Acetate Injection is indicated for treatment of severe diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors. 1.3 Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors Octreotide Acetate Injection is indicated for the treatment of the profuse watery diarrhea associated with vasoactive intestinal peptide tumors (VIPomas)-secreting tumors. 1.4 Important Limitations of Use Improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, or reduction in tumor size or rate of growth, were not shown in clinical trials performed with Octreotide Acetate Injection; these trials were not optimally designed to detect such effects."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. ( 2.1 ) Acromegaly : Recommended initial octreotide acetate injection dosage is 50 mcg three times daily during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. Maintenance dose 100 mcg to 500 mcg three times daily. ( 2.2 ) Carcinoid Tumors : Recommended dosage range of 100 mcg to 600 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.3 ) VIPomas : Recommended dosage range of 200 mcg to 300 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Dosage and Administration Overview Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. Pain with subcutaneous administration may be reduced by using the smallest volume that will deliver the desired dose. Sites should be rotated in a systematic manner. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if particulates and/or discoloration are observed. Octreotide acetate injection is not compatible in Total Parenteral Nutrition solutions because of the formation of a glycosyl octreotide conjugate which may decrease the efficacy of the product. Octreotide acetate injection may be diluted in volumes of 50 mL to 200 mL and infused intravenously over 15 to 30 minutes or administered by intravenous (IV) push over 3 minutes. In emergency situations (e.g., carcinoid crisis), it may be given by rapid bolus. Assess total and/or free T4 levels at baseline and periodically during chronic octreotide acetate injection therapy. 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Acromegaly The recommended initial dosage of octreotide acetate injection is 50 mcg three times daily to be administered subcutaneously. Increase octreotide acetate injection dose based upon GH or IGF-1 levels. The goal is to achieve GH levels less than 5 ng/mL or IGF-1 levels within normal range. Monitor GH or IGF-1 every two weeks after initiating octreotide acetate injection therapy or with dosage change, and to guide titration. The most common dosage is 100 mcg three times daily, but some patients require up to 500 mcg three times daily for maximum effectiveness. Doses greater than 300 mcg/day seldom result in additional biochemical benefit, and if an increase in dose fails to provide additional benefit, the dose should be reduced. Octreotide acetate injection should be withdrawn yearly for approximately 4 weeks from patients who have received irradiation to assess disease activity. If GH or IGF-1 levels increase and signs and symptoms recur, octreotide acetate injection therapy may be resumed. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Carcinoid Tumors The recommended daily dosage of octreotide acetate injection during the first 2 weeks of therapy ranges from 100 to 600 mcg/day in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously (mean daily dosage is 300 mcg). In the clinical studies, the median daily maintenance dosage was approximately 450 mcg, but clinical and biochemical benefits were obtained in some patients with as little as 50 mcg, while others required doses up to 1500 mcg/day. However, experience with doses above 750 mcg/day is limited. Measurement of urinary 5- hydroxyindole acetic acid, plasma serotonin, plasma Substance P may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy. 2.4 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors Daily dosages of 200 mcg to 300 mcg in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously are recommended during the initial 2 weeks of therapy (range, 150 mcg to 750 mcg) to control symptoms of the disease. On an individual basis, dosage may be adjusted to achieve a therapeutic response, but usually doses above 450 mcg/day are not required. Measurement of Plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac Function Abnormalities : Increased risk for higher degree of atrioventricular blocks. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate intravenously. Bradycardia, arrhythmias, or conduction abnormalities may occur. Use with caution in at-risk patients. Dosage adjustment of cardiac medications may be necessary. ( 5.1 ) Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis : Monitor periodically. Discontinue if complications of cholelithiasis are suspected. ( 5.2 ) Glucose Metabolism : Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia may occur. Glucose monitoring is recommended and anti-diabetic treatment may need adjustment. ( 5.3 ) Thyroid Function : Hypothyroidism may occur. Monitor thyroid levels periodically. ( 5.4 ) Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats : New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss may occur. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported, evaluate for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Cardiac Function Abnormalities Complete Atrioventricular Block Patients who receive octreotide acetate intravenously may be at increased risk for higher degree atrioventricular blocks. In post marketing reports, complete atrioventricular block was reported in patients receiving IV octreotide acetate during surgical procedures. In the majority of patients, octreotide acetate was given at higher than recommended doses and/or as a continuous IV infusion. The safety of continuous IV infusion has not been established in patients receiving octreotide acetate for the approved indications. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate intravenously. Other Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities Other cardiac conduction abnormalities have occurred during treatment with octreotide acetate. In acromegalic patients, bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias occurred in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Other electrocardiogram (ECG) changes observed included QT prolongation, axis shifts, early repolarization, low voltage, R/S transition, and early R-wave progression. These ECG changes are not uncommon in acromegalic patients. Dose adjustments in drugs such as beta-blockers that have bradycardia effects may be necessary. In one acromegalic patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), initiation of octreotide acetate therapy resulted in worsening of CHF with improvement when drug was discontinued. Confirmation of a drug effect was obtained with a positive rechallenge. 5.2 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis Octreotide acetate may inhibit gallbladder contractility and decrease bile secretion, which may lead to gallbladder abnormalities or sludge. Acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, biliary obstruction, cholestatic hepatitis, or pancreatitis have been reported with octreotide acetate therapy. In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate for 1 month or less developed gallstones. One patient developed ascending cholangitis during octreotide acetate therapy and died. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue octreotide acetate and treat appropriately. 5.3 Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia Octreotide acetate alters the balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon and GH, which may result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia which occurs during octreotide acetate therapy is usually mild but may result in overt diabetes mellitus or necessitate dose changes in insulin or other anti-diabetic agents. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred on octreotide acetate in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Severe hyperglycemia, subsequent pneumonia, and death following initiation of octreotide acetate therapy was reported in one patient with no history of hyperglycemia. Monitor glucose levels during octreotide acetate therapy. Adjust dosing of insulin or other anti-diabetic therapy accordingly. 5.4 Thyroid Function Abnormalities Octreotide suppresses secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which may result in hypothyroidism. Baseline and periodic assessment of thyroid function (TSH, total, and/or free T 4 ) is recommended during chronic therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 5.5 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration and loose stools have been reported in patients receiving somatostatin analogs, including octreotide acetate. Somatostatin analogs reversibly inhibit secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile acids, which may result in malabsorption of dietary fats and subsequent symptoms of steatorrhea, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported in patients receiving octreotide acetate, evaluate patients for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and manage accordingly. 5.6 Changes in Vitamin B12 Levels Depressed vitamin B 12 levels and abnormal Schilling's tests have been observed in some patients receiving octreotide acetate therapy, and monitoring of vitamin B 12 levels is recommended during octreotide acetate therapy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Complete Atrioventricular Block [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Thyroid Function Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Changes in Vitamin B12 Levels [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) in patients with acromegaly are gallbladder abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, abdominal discomfort, hyperglycemia, and hypothyroidism. In other patients, most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) are gallbladder abnormalities. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Gallbladder Abnormalities Gallbladder abnormalities, especially stones and/or biliary sludge, frequently develop in patients on chronic octreotide acetate therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate for 1 month or less developed gallstones. Cardiac In acromegalics, sinus bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias developed in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Gastrointestinal Diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, and abdominal discomfort were each seen in 34% to 61% of acromegalic patients in U.S. studies. 2.6% of the patients discontinued therapy due to these symptoms. These symptoms were seen in 5% to 10% of patients with carcinoid tumors and VIPomas. The frequency of these symptoms was not dose related, but diarrhea and abdominal discomfort generally resolved more quickly in patients treated with 300 mcg/day than in those treated with 750 mcg/day. Vomiting, flatulence, abnormal stools, abdominal distention, and constipation were each seen in less than 10% of patients. In rare instances, gastrointestinal side effects may resemble acute intestinal obstruction, with progressive abdominal distension, severe epigastric pain, abdominal tenderness, and guarding. Hypo/Hyperglycemia Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively, but only in about 1.5% of other patients. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were noted in approximately 2% of patients. Hypothyroidism In acromegalics, biochemical hypothyroidism alone occurred in 12% while goiter occurred in 8% and 4% required initiation of thyroid replacement therapy during octreotide acetate therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . In patients without acromegaly, hypothyroidism has only been reported in several isolated patients and goiter has not been reported. Other Adverse Events Pain on injection was reported in 7.7%, headache in 6%, and dizziness in 5%. Pancreatitis was also observed [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Other Adverse Events 1% to 4% Other events, each observed in 1% to 4% of patients, included fatigue, weakness, pruritus, joint pain, backache, urinary tract infection, cold symptoms, flu symptoms, injection site hematoma, bruise, edema, flushing, blurred vision, pollakiuria, fat malabsorption, hair loss, visual disturbance, and depression. Anaphylactoid reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported in several patients receiving octreotide acetate. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of octreotide acetate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary : cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cholangitis and pancreatitis, which have sometimes required cholecystectomy Gastrointestinal : intestinal obstruction, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency Hematologic : thrombocytopenia"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The following drugs require monitoring and possible dose adjustment when used with octreotide acetate : cyclosporine, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, beta-blockers, and bromocriptine. ( 7 ) Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection : Discontinue octreotide acetate at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Cyclosporine Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. Concomitant administration of octreotide acetate with cyclosporine may decrease blood levels of cyclosporine and result in transplant rejection. 7.2 Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Drugs Octreotide inhibits the secretion of insulin and glucagon. Therefore, blood glucose levels should be monitored when octreotide acetate treatment is initiated or when the dose is altered and anti-diabetic treatment should be adjusted accordingly. 7.3 Bromocriptine Concomitant administration of octreotide and bromocriptine increases the availability of bromocriptine. 7.4 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy Concomitant administration of bradycardia-inducing drugs (e.g., beta-blockers) may have an additive effect on the reduction of heart rate associated with octreotide. Dose adjustments of concomitant medication may be necessary. Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. 7.5 Drug Metabolism Interactions Limited published data indicate that somatostatin analogs might decrease the metabolic clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which may be due to the suppression of GH. Since it cannot be excluded that octreotide may have this effect, other drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and which have a low therapeutic index (e.g., quinidine, terfenadine) should therefore be used with caution. 7.6 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection Octreotide competitively binds to somatostatin receptors and may interfere with the efficacy of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Discontinue octreotide acetate at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited data with octreotide acetate in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental-effects were observed with IV administration of octreotide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 7- and 13-times, respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.5 mg/day based on body surface area (BSA). Transient growth retardation, with no impact on postnatal development, was observed in rat offspring from a pre- and post-natal study of octreotide at IV doses below the MRHD based on BSA ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In postmarketing data, a limited number of exposed pregnancies have been reported in patients with acromegaly. Most women were exposed to octreotide during the first trimester of pregnancy at doses ranging from 100 to 300 mcg/day of octreotide acetate or 20 mg to 30 mg once a month of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, however some women elected to continue octreotide therapy throughout pregnancy. In cases with a known outcome, no congenital malformations were reported. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received IV doses of octreotide up to 1 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. A slight reduction in body weight gain was noted in pregnant rats at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day. There were no maternal effects in rabbits or embryo-fetal effects in either species up to the maximum dose tested. At 1 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, the dose multiple was approximately 7- and 13-times, respectively, at the highest recommended human dose of 1.5 mg/day based on BSA. In a pre- and post-natal development rat study at IV doses of 0.02-1 mg/kg/day, a transient growth retardation of the offspring was observed at all doses which was possibly a consequence of GH inhibition by octreotide. The doses attributed to the delayed growth are below the human dose of 1.5 mg/day, based on BSA. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of octreotide acetate in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies show that octreotide administered subcutaneously passes into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk ( see Data ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for octreotide acetate, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from octreotide acetate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Following a subcutaneous dose (1 mg/kg) of octreotide to lactating rats, transfer of octreotide into milk was observed at a low concentration compared to plasma (milk/plasma ratio of 0.009). 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as the therapeutic benefits of a reduction in GH levels and normalization of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration in acromegalic females treated with octreotide may lead to improved fertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of octreotide acetate in the pediatric population have not been demonstrated. No formal controlled clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of octreotide acetate in pediatric patients under age 6 years. In postmarketing reports, serious adverse events, including hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death, have been reported with octreotide acetate use in children, most notably in children under 2 years of age. The relationship of these events to octreotide has not been established as the majority of these pediatric patients had serious underlying co-morbid conditions. The efficacy and safety of octreotide acetate using the octreotide acetate for injectable suspension formulation was examined in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6 month pharmacokinetics study in 60 pediatric patients age 6 to 17 years with hypothalamic obesity resulting from cranial insult. The mean octreotide concentration after 6 doses of 40 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by intramuscular (IM) injection every 4 weeks was approximately 3 ng/mL. Steady-state concentrations was achieved after 3 injections of a 40-mg dose. Mean body mass index (BMI) increased 0.1 kg/m 2 in octreotide acetate for injectable suspension-treated subjects compared to 0.0 kg/m 2 in saline control-treated subjects. Efficacy was not demonstrated. Diarrhea occurred in 11 of 30 (37%) patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. No unexpected adverse events were observed. However, with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adult indications such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was 10 mg to 30 mg once a month. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of octreotide acetate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, the half-life of octreotide acetate may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment-Cirrhotic Patients In patients with liver cirrhosis, the half-life of the drug may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Octreotide acetate exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin. It is an even more potent inhibitor of GH, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it also suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, VIP, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide. By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and VIP secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Octreotide substantially reduces GH and/or IGF-1 (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly. Single doses of octreotide have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Octreotide suppresses secretion of TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection, octreotide is absorbed rapidly and completely from the injection site. Peak concentrations of 5.2 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) were reached 0.4 hours after dosing. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, IV and subcutaneous doses were found to be bioequivalent. Peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) values were dose proportional after IV single doses up to 200 mcg and subcutaneous single doses up to 500 mcg and after subcutaneous multiple doses up to 500 mcg 3 times a day (1,500 mcg/day). In patients with acromegaly, a mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing. Distribution In healthy volunteers, the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (t\u03b1\u00bd = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 13.6 L, and the total body clearance ranged from 7 L/hr to 10 L/hr. In blood, the distribution into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner. Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. In patients with acromegaly, the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 21.6 \u00b1 8.5 L, and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h. The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%. Elimination The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 to 1.9 hours compared with 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone. The duration of action of octreotide acetate is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor. About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine. In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug. In patients with acromegaly, the disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normal subjects. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR 40 to 60 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 2.4 hours and total body clearance was 8.8 L/hr, in moderate impairment (CL CR 10 to 39 mL/min) t 1/2 was 3.0 hours and total body clearance 7.3 L/hr. In patients with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis (CL CR < 10 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 3.1 hours and total body clearance was 7.6 L/hr. In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, total body clearance was reduced to about half that found in healthy subjects (from approximately 10 L/hr to 4.5 L/hr). Hepatic Impairment Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide t 1/2 increasing to 3.7 hr and total body clearance decreasing to 5.9 L/hr, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed t 1/2 increased to 3.4 hr and total body clearance of 8.2 L/hr. 12.6 Immunogenicity Evaluation of 20 patients treated for at least 6 months has failed to demonstrate titers of antibodies exceeding background levels. However, antibody titers to octreotide acetate were subsequently reported in 3 patients and resulted in prolonged duration of drug action in 2 patients."

In patients with acromegaly, a mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing. Distribution In healthy volunteers, the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (t\u03b1\u00bd = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 13.6 L, and the total body clearance ranged from 7 L/hr to 10 L/hr. In blood, the distribution into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner. Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. In patients with acromegaly, the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 21.6 \u00b1 8.5 L, and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h. The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%. Elimination The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 to 1.9 hours compared with 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone. The duration of action of octreotide acetate is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor. About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine. In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug. In patients with acromegaly, the disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normal subjects. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR 40 to 60 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 2.4 hours and total body clearance was 8.8 L/hr, in moderate impairment (CL CR 10 to 39 mL/min) t 1/2 was 3.0 hours and total body clearance 7.3 L/hr. In patients with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis (CL CR < 10 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 3.1 hours and total body clearance was 7.6 L/hr. In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, total body clearance was reduced to about half that found in healthy subjects (from approximately 10 L/hr to 4.5 L/hr). Hepatic Impairment Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide t 1/2 increasing to 3.7 hr and total body clearance decreasing to 5.9 L/hr, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed t 1/2 increased to 3.4 hr and total body clearance of 8.2 L/hr."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated no mutagenic potential of octreotide acetate. No carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in mice treated subcutaneously for 85 to 99 weeks at doses up to 2,000 mcg/kg/day (8 x the human exposure based on BSA). In a 116-week subcutaneous study in rats, a 27% and 12% incidence of injection-site sarcomas or squamous cell carcinomas was observed in males and females, respectively, at the highest dose level of 1,250 mcg/kg/day (10 x the human exposure based on BSA) compared to an incidence of 8% to 10% in the vehicle-control groups. The increased incidence of injection-site tumors was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to repeated subcutaneous injections at the same site. Rotating injection sites would prevent chronic irritation in humans. There have been no reports of injection-site tumors in patients treated with octreotide acetate for up to 5 years. There was also a 15% incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas in the 1,250 mcg/kg/day females compared to 7% in the saline-control females and 0% in the vehicle-control females. The presence of endometritis coupled with the absence of corpora lutea, the reduction in mammary fibroadenomas, and the presence of uterine dilatation suggest that the uterine tumors were associated with estrogen dominance in the aged female rats which does not occur in humans. Octreotide did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 1,000 mcg/kg/day, which represents 7-times the human exposure based on BSA."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Octreotide acetate injection is a somatostatin analogue indicated: Acromegaly : To reduce blood levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1; somatomedin C) in acromegaly patients who have had inadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgical resection, pituitary irradiation, and bromocriptine mesylate at maximally tolerated doses. ( 1.1 ) Carcinoid Tumors : For the symptomatic treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors where it suppresses or inhibits the severe diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with the disease. ( 1.2 ) Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors (VIPomas) : For the treatment of profuse watery diarrhea associated with VIP-secreting tumors. ( 1.3 ) Limitations of Use Improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, or reduction in tumor size or rate of growth, were not shown in clinical trials performed with octreotide acetate injection; these trials were not optimally designed to detect such effects. ( 1.4 ) 1.1 Acromegaly Octreotide acetate injection is indicated to reduce blood levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1; somatomedin C) in acromegaly patients who have had inadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgical resection, pituitary irradiation, and bromocriptine mesylate at maximally tolerated doses. 1.2 Carcinoid Tumors Octreotide acetate injection is indicated for treatment of severe diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors. 1.3 Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors Octreotide acetate injection is indicated for the treatment of the profuse watery diarrhea associated with vasoactive intestinal peptide tumors (VIPomas)-secreting tumors. 1.4 Important Limitations of Use Improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, or reduction in tumor size or rate of growth, were not shown in clinical trials performed with octreotide acetate injection; these trials were not optimally designed to detect such effects."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. ( 2.1 ) Acromegaly : Recommended initial octreotide acetate dosage is 50 mcg three times daily during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. Maintenance dose 100 mcg to 500 mcg three times daily. ( 2.2 ) Carcinoid Tumors : Recommended dosage range of 100 mcg to 600 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.3 ) VIPomas : Recommended dosage range of 200 mcg to 300 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Dosage and Administration Overview Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. Pain with subcutaneous administration may be reduced by using the smallest volume that will deliver the desired dose. Sites should be rotated in a systematic manner. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if particulates and/or discoloration are observed. Octreotide acetate injection is not compatible in Total Parenteral Nutrition solutions because of the formation of a glycosyl octreotide conjugate which may decrease the efficacy of the product. Octreotide acetate injection may be diluted in volumes of 50 mL to 200 mL and infused intravenously over 15 to 30 minutes or administered by intravenous (IV) push over 3 minutes. In emergency situations (e.g., carcinoid crisis), it may be given by rapid bolus. Assess total and/or free T4 levels at baseline and periodically during chronic octreotide acetate therapy. 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Acromegaly The recommended initial dosage of octreotide acetate is 50 mcg three times daily to be administered subcutaneously. Increase octreotide acetate dose based upon GH or IGF-1 levels. The goal is to achieve GH levels less than 5 ng/mL or IGF-1 levels within normal range. Monitor GH or IGF-1 every two weeks after initiating octreotide acetate therapy or with dosage change, and to guide titration. The most common dosage is 100 mcg three times daily, but some patients require up to 500 mcg three times daily for maximum effectiveness. Doses greater than 300 mcg/day seldom result in additional biochemical benefit, and if an increase in dose fails to provide additional benefit, the dose should be reduced. Octreotide acetate injection should be withdrawn yearly for approximately 4 weeks from patients who have received irradiation to assess disease activity. If GH or IGF-1 levels increase and signs and symptoms recur, octreotide acetate injection therapy may be resumed. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Carcinoid Tumors The recommended daily dosage of octreotide acetate injection during the first 2 weeks of therapy ranges from 100 to 600 mcg/day in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously (mean daily dosage is 300 mcg). In the clinical studies, the median daily maintenance dosage was approximately 450 mcg, but clinical and biochemical benefits were obtained in some patients with as little as 50 mcg, while others required doses up to 1500 mcg/day. However, experience with doses above 750 mcg/day is limited. Measurement of urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, plasma serotonin, plasma Substance P may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy. 2.4 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors Daily dosages of 200 mcg to 300 mcg in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously are recommended during the initial 2 weeks of therapy (range, 150 mcg to 750 mcg) to control symptoms of the disease. On an individual basis, dosage may be adjusted to achieve a therapeutic response, but usually doses above 450 mcg/day are not required. Measurement of Plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac Function Abnormalities : Increased risk for higher degree of atrioventricular blocks. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Bradycardia, arrhythmias, or conduction abnormalities may occur. Use with caution in at-risk patients. Dosage adjustment of cardiac medications may be necessary. ( 5.1 ) Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis : Monitor periodically. Discontinue if complications of cholelithiasis are suspected. ( 5.2 ) Glucose Metabolism : Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia may occur. Glucose monitoring is recommended and anti-diabetic treatment may need adjustment. ( 5.3 ) Thyroid Function : Hypothyroidism may occur. Monitor thyroid levels periodically. ( 5.4 ) Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats : New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss may occur. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported, evaluate for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Cardiac Function Abnormalities Complete Atrioventricular Block Patients who receive octreotide acetate injection intravenously may be at increased risk for higher degree atrioventricular blocks. In postmarketing reports, complete atrioventricular block was reported in patients receiving IV octreotide acetate injection during surgical procedures. In the majority of patients, octreotide acetate injection was given at higher than recommended doses and/or as a continuous IV infusion. The safety of continuous IV infusion has not been established in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection for the approved indications. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Other Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities Other cardiac conduction abnormalities have occurred during treatment with octreotide acetate injection. In acromegalic patients, bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias occurred in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Other electrocardiogram (ECG) changes observed included QT prolongation, axis shifts, early repolarization, low voltage, R/S transition, and early R-wave progression. These ECG changes are not uncommon in acromegalic patients. Dose adjustments in drugs such as beta-blockers that have bradycardia effects may be necessary. In one acromegalic patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy resulted in worsening of CHF with improvement when drug was discontinued. Confirmation of a drug effect was obtained with a positive rechallenge. 5.2 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis Octreotide acetate injection may inhibit gallbladder contractility and decrease bile secretion, which may lead to gallbladder abnormalities or sludge. Acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, biliary obstruction, cholestatic hepatitis, or pancreatitis have been reported with octreotide acetate injection therapy. In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. One patient developed ascending cholangitis during octreotide acetate injection therapy and died. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue octreotide acetate injection and treat appropriately. 5.3 Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia Octreotide acetate injection alters the balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon and GH, which may result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia which occurs during octreotide acetate injection therapy is usually mild but may result in overt diabetes mellitus or necessitate dose changes in insulin or other anti-diabetic agents. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred on octreotide acetate injection in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Severe hyperglycemia, subsequent pneumonia, and death following initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy was reported in one patient with no history of hyperglycemia. Monitor glucose levels during octreotide acetate injection therapy. Adjust dosing of insulin or other anti-diabetic therapy accordingly. 5.4 Thyroid Function Abnormalities Octreotide suppresses secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which may result in hypothyroidism. Baseline and periodic assessment of thyroid function (TSH, total, and/or free T 4 ) is recommended during chronic therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.5 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration and loose stools have been reported in patients receiving somatostatin analogs, including octreotide acetate. Somatostatin analogs reversibly inhibit secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile acids, which may result in malabsorption of dietary fats and subsequent symptoms of steatorrhea, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported in patients receiving octreotide acetate, evaluate patients for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and manage accordingly. 5.6 Changes in Vitamin B12 Levels Depressed vitamin B12 levels and abnormal Schilling\u2019s tests have been observed in some patients receiving octreotide acetate injection therapy, and monitoring of vitamin B12 levels is recommended during octreotide acetate injection therapy."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gland Pharma Limited at 864-879-9994 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Gallbladder Abnormalities Gallbladder abnormalities, especially stones and/or biliary sludge, frequently develop in patients on chronic octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. Cardiac In acromegalics, sinus bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias developed in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Gastrointestinal Diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, and abdominal discomfort were each seen in 34% to 61% of acromegalic patients in U.S. studies. 2.6% of the patients discontinued therapy due to these symptoms. These symptoms were seen in 5% to 10% of patients with carcinoid tumors and VIPomas. The frequency of these symptoms was not dose related, but diarrhea and abdominal discomfort generally resolved more quickly in patients treated with 300 mcg/day than in those treated with 750 mcg/day. Vomiting, flatulence, abnormal stools, abdominal distention, and constipation were each seen in less than 10% of patients. In rare instances, gastrointestinal side effects may resemble acute intestinal obstruction, with progressive abdominal distension, severe epigastric pain, abdominal tenderness, and guarding. Hypo/Hyperglycemia Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively, but only in about 1.5% of other patients. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were noted in approximately 2% of patients. Hypothyroidism In acromegalics, biochemical hypothyroidism alone occurred in 12% while goiter occurred in 8% and 4% required initiation of thyroid replacement therapy during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. In patients without acromegaly, hypothyroidism has only been reported in several isolated patients and goiter has not been reported. Other Adverse Events Pain on injection was reported in 7.7%, headache in 6%, and dizziness in 5%. Pancreatitis was also observed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Other Adverse Events 1% to 4% Other events, each observed in 1% to 4% of patients, included fatigue, weakness, pruritus, joint pain, backache, urinary tract infection, cold symptoms, flu symptoms, injection site hematoma, bruise, edema, flushing, blurred vision, pollakiuria, fat malabsorption, hair loss, visual disturbance, and depression. Anaphylactoid reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported in several patients receiving octreotide acetate injection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of octreotide acetate injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary: cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cholangitis and pancreatitis, which have sometimes required cholecystectomy Gastrointestinal : intestinal obstruction, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency Hematologic: thrombocytopenia"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The following drugs require monitoring and possible dose adjustment when used with octreotide acetate injection : cyclosporine, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, beta-blockers, and bromocriptine. ( 7 ) Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection : Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Cyclosporine Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. Concomitant administration of octreotide acetate injection with cyclosporine may decrease blood levels of cyclosporine and result in transplant rejection. 7.2 Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Drugs Octreotide inhibits the secretion of insulin and glucagon. Therefore, blood glucose levels should be monitored when octreotide acetate injection treatment is initiated or when the dose is altered and anti-diabetic treatment should be adjusted accordingly. 7.3 Bromocriptine Concomitant administration of octreotide and bromocriptine increases the availability of bromocriptine. 7.4 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy Concomitant administration of bradycardia-inducing drugs (e.g., beta-blockers) may have an additive effect on the reduction of heart rate associated with octreotide. Dose adjustments of concomitant medication may be necessary. Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. 7.5 Drug Metabolism Interactions Limited published data indicate that somatostatin analogs might decrease the metabolic clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which may be due to the suppression of GH. Since it cannot be excluded that octreotide may have this effect, other drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and which have a low therapeutic index (e.g., quinidine, terfenadine) should therefore be used with caution. 7.6 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection Octreotide competitively binds to somatostatin receptors and may interfere with the efficacy of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited data with octreotide acetate injection in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental-effects were observed with IV administration of octreotide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 7- and 13-times, respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.5 mg/day based on body surface area (BSA). Transient growth retardation, with no impact on postnatal development, was observed in rat offspring from a pre- and post-natal study of octreotide at IV doses below the MRHD based on BSA (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In postmarketing data, a limited number of exposed pregnancies have been reported in patients with acromegaly. Most women were exposed to octreotide during the first trimester of pregnancy at doses ranging from 100 to 300 mcg/day of octreotide acetate injection or 20 mg to 30 mg once a month of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, however some women elected to continue octreotide therapy throughout pregnancy. In cases with a known outcome, no congenital malformations were reported. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received IV doses of octreotide up to 1 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. A slight reduction in body weight gain was noted in pregnant rats at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day. There were no maternal effects in rabbits or embryo-fetal effects in either species up to the maximum dose tested. At 1 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, the dose multiple was approximately 7- and 13-times, respectively, at the highest recommended human dose of 1.5 mg/day based on BSA. In a pre- and post-natal development rat study at IV doses of 0.02 to 1 mg/kg/day, a transient growth retardation of the offspring was observed at all doses which was possibly a consequence of GH inhibition by octreotide. The doses attributed to the delayed growth are below the human dose of 1.5 mg/day, based on BSA. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of octreotide acetate injection in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies show that octreotide administered subcutaneously passes into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk ( see Data ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for octreotide acetate injection, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from octreotide acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Following a subcutaneous dose (1 mg/kg) of octreotide to lactating rats, transfer of octreotide into milk was observed at a low concentration compared to plasma (milk/plasma ratio of 0.009). 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as the therapeutic benefits of a reduction in GH levels and normalization of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration in acromegalic females treated with octreotide may lead to improved fertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of octreotide acetate injection in the pediatric population have not been demonstrated. No formal controlled clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of octreotide acetate injection in pediatric patients under age 6 years. In postmarketing reports, serious adverse events, including hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death, have been reported with octreotide acetate injection use in children, most notably in children under 2 years of age. The relationship of these events to octreotide has not been established as the majority of these pediatric patients had serious underlying co-morbid conditions. The efficacy and safety of octreotide acetate injection using the octreotide acetate for injectable suspension formulation was examined in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6 month pharmacokinetics study in 60 pediatric patients age 6 to 17 years with hypothalamic obesity resulting from cranial insult. The mean octreotide concentration after 6 doses of 40 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by intramuscular (IM) injection every 4 weeks was approximately 3 ng/mL. Steady-state concentrations was achieved after 3 injections of a 40-mg dose. Mean body mass index (BMI) increased 0.1 kg/m 2 in octreotide acetate for injectable suspension-treated subjects compared to 0.0 kg/m 2 in saline control-treated subjects. Efficacy was not demonstrated. Diarrhea occurred in 11 of 30 (37%) patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. No unexpected adverse events were observed. However, with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adult indications such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was 10 mg to 30 mg once a month. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of octreotide acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, the half-life of octreotide acetate may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 8.7 Hepatic Impairment-Cirrhotic Patients In patients with liver cirrhosis, the half-life of the drug may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage.

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Octreotide acetate injection, a cyclic octapeptide prepared as a clear sterile solution of octreotide, acetate salt, in a buffered lactic acid solution for administration by deep subcutaneous or IV injection. Octreotide acetate, known chemically as L-Cysteinamide, D-phenylalanyl-L-cysteinyl-L-phenylalanyl-D-tryptophyl-L-lysyl-L-threonyl-N-[2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)propyl]-,cyclic (2 \u2192 7)-disulfide; [R-(R*, R*)] acetate salt, is a long-acting octapeptide with pharmacologic actions mimicking those of the natural hormone somatostatin. Octreotide acetate injection is available as sterile 1 mL single-dose vials in 2 strengths containing 100 mcg or 500 mcg octreotide (as acetate). Each single-dose vial also contains lactic acid, USP (3.4 mg), mannitol, USP (45 mg), sodium bicarbonate, USP (quantity sufficient to pH 4.2 \u00b1 0.3), water for injection, USP (quantity sufficient to 1 mL). Lactic acid and sodium bicarbonate are added to provide a buffered solution, pH to 4.2 \u00b1 0.3. The molecular weight of octreotide acetate is 1019.3 g/mol (free peptide, C 49 H 66 N 10 O 10 S 2 ) and its amino acid sequence is: octreotide-spl-structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Octreotide acetate injection exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin. It is an even more potent inhibitor of GH, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it also suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, VIP, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide. By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and VIP secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Octreotide substantially reduces GH and/or IGF-1 (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly. Single doses of octreotide have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Octreotide suppresses secretion of TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection, octreotide is absorbed rapidly and completely from the injection site. Peak concentrations of 5.2 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) were reached 0.4 hours after dosing. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, IV and subcutaneous doses were found to be bioequivalent. Peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) values were dose proportional after IV single doses up to 200 mcg and subcutaneous single doses up to 500 mcg and after subcutaneous multiple doses up to 500 mcg 3 times a day (1,500 mcg/day). In patients with acromegaly, a mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing. Distribution In healthy volunteers, the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (t\u03b1\u00bd = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 13.6 L, and the total body clearance ranged from 7 L/hr to 10 L/hr. In blood, the distribution into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner. Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. In patients with acromegaly, the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 21.6 \u00b1 8.5 L, and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h. The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%. Elimination The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 to 1.9 hours compared with 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone. The duration of action of octreotide acetate injection is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor. About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine. In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug. In patients with acromegaly, the disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normal subjects. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR 40 to 60 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 2.4 hours and total body clearance was 8.8 L/hr, in moderate impairment (CL CR 10 to 39 mL/min) t 1/2 was 3.0 hours and total body clearance 7.3 L/hr. In patients with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis (CL CR < 10 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 3.1 hours and total body clearance was 7.6 L/hr. In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, total body clearance was reduced to about half that found in healthy subjects (from approximately 10 L/hr to 4.5 L/hr). Hepatic Impairment Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide t 1/2 increasing to 3.7 hr and total body clearance decreasing to 5.9 L/hr, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed t 1/2 increased to 3.4 hr and total body clearance of 8.2 L/hr. 12.6 Immunogenicity Evaluation of 20 patients treated for at least 6 months has failed to demonstrate titers of antibodies exceeding background levels. However, antibody titers to octreotide acetate injection were subsequently reported in 3 patients and resulted in prolonged duration of drug action in 2 patients."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated no mutagenic potential of octreotide acetate injection. No carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in mice treated subcutaneously for 85 to 99 weeks at doses up to 2,000 mcg/kg/day (8 x the human exposure based on BSA). In a 116-week subcutaneous study in rats, a 27% and 12% incidence of injection-site sarcomas or squamous cell carcinomas was observed in males and females, respectively, at the highest dose level of 1,250 mcg/kg/day (10 x the human exposure based on BSA) compared to an incidence of 8% to 10% in the vehicle-control groups. The increased incidence of injection-site tumors was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to repeated subcutaneous injections at the same site. Rotating injection sites would prevent chronic irritation in humans. There have been no reports of injection-site tumors in patients treated with octreotide acetate for up to 5 years. There was also a 15% incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas in the 1,250 mcg/kg/day females compared to 7% in the saline-control females and 0% in the vehicle-control females. The presence of endometritis coupled with the absence of corpora lutea, the reduction in mammary fibroadenomas, and the presence of uterine dilatation suggest that the uterine tumors were associated with estrogen dominance in the aged female rats which does not occur in humans. Octreotide did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 1,000 mcg/kg/day, which represents 7-times the human exposure based on BSA."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. ( 2.1 ) Acromegaly: Recommended initial octreotide acetate dosage is 50 mcg three times daily during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. Maintenance dose 100 mcg to 500 mcg three times daily. ( 2.2 ) Carcinoid Tumors: Recommended dosage range of 100 mcg to 600 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.3 ) VIPomas: Recommended dosage range of 200 mcg to 300 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.4 ) Injection: 50 mcg/mL, 100 mcg/mL, or 500 mcg/mL of octreotide (as acetate) in a single-dose amber vial. ( 3 ). 200 mcg/mL, or 1000 mcg/mL of octreotide (as acetate) in a multi-dose amber vials individually boxed. ( 3 ) 2.1 Dosage and Administration Overview Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. Pain with subcutaneous administration may be reduced by using the smallest volume that will deliver the desired dose. Sites should be rotated in a systematic manner. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if particulates and/or discoloration are observed. Octreotide acetate injection is not compatible in Total Parenteral Nutrition solutions because of the formation of a glycosyl octreotide conjugate which may decrease the efficacy of the product. Octreotide acetate injection may be diluted in volumes of 50 mL to 200 mL and infused intravenously over 15 to 30 minutes or administered by intravenous (IV) push over 3 minutes. In emergency situations (e.g., carcinoid crisis), it may be given by rapid bolus. Assess total and/or free T4 levels at baseline and periodically during chronic octreotide acetate therapy. 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Acromegaly The recommended initial dosage of octreotide acetate is 50 mcg three times daily to be administered subcutaneously. Increase octreotide acetate dose based upon GH or IGF-1 levels. The goal is to achieve GH levels less than 5 ng/mL or IGF-1 levels within normal range. Monitor GH or IGF-1 every two weeks after initiating octreotide acetate therapy or with dosage change, and to guide titration. The most common dosage is 100 mcg three times daily, but some patients require up to 500 mcg three times daily for maximum effectiveness. Doses greater than 300 mcg/day seldom result in additional biochemical benefit, and if an increase in dose fails to provide additional benefit, the dose should be reduced. Octreotide acetate injection should be withdrawn yearly for approximately 4 weeks from patients who have received irradiation to assess disease activity. If GH or IGF-1 levels increase and signs and symptoms recur, octreotide acetate injection therapy may be resumed. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Carcinoid Tumors The recommended daily dosage of octreotide acetate injection during the first 2 weeks of therapy ranges from 100 to 600 mcg/day in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously (mean daily dosage is 300 mcg). In the clinical studies, the median daily maintenance dosage was approximately 450 mcg, but clinical and biochemical benefits were obtained in some patients with as little as 50 mcg, while others required doses up to 1500 mcg/day. However, experience with doses above 750 mcg/day is limited. Measurement of urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, plasma serotonin, plasma Substance P may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy. 2.4 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors Daily dosages of 200 mcg to 300 mcg in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously are recommended during the initial 2 weeks of therapy (range, 150 mcg to 750 mcg) to control symptoms of the disease. On an individual basis, dosage may be adjusted to achieve a therapeutic response, but usually doses above 450 mcg/day are not required. Measurement of Plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac Function Abnormalities: Increased risk for higher degree of atrioventricular blocks. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Bradycardia, arrhythmias, or conduction abnormalities may occur. Use with caution in at-risk patients. Dosage adjustment of cardiac medications may be necessary. ( 5.1 ) Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis: Monitor periodically. Discontinue if complications of cholelithiasis are suspected. ( 5.2 ) Glucose Metabolism: Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia may occur. Glucose monitoring is recommended and anti-diabetic treatment may need adjustment. ( 5.3 ) Thyroid Function: Hypothyroidism may occur. Monitor thyroid levels periodically. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiac Function Abnormalities Complete Atrioventricular Block Patients who receive octreotide acetate injection intravenously may be at increased risk for higher degree atrioventricular blocks. In postmarketing reports, complete atrioventricular block was reported in patients receiving IV octreotide acetate injection during surgical procedures. In the majority of patients, octreotide acetate injection was given at higher than recommended doses and/or as a continuous IV infusion. The safety of continuous IV infusion has not been established in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection for the approved indications. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Other Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities Other cardiac conduction abnormalities have occurred during treatment with octreotide acetate injection. In acromegalic patients, bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias occurred in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Other electrocardiogram (ECG) changes observed included QT prolongation, axis shifts, early repolarization, low voltage, R/S transition, and early R-wave progression. These ECG changes are not uncommon in acromegalic patients. Dose adjustments in drugs such as beta-blockers that have bradycardia effects may be necessary. In one acromegalic patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy resulted in worsening of CHF with improvement when drug was discontinued. Confirmation of a drug effect was obtained with a positive rechallenge. 5.2 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis Octreotide acetate injection may inhibit gallbladder contractility and decrease bile secretion, which may lead to gallbladder abnormalities or sludge. Acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, biliary obstruction, cholestatic hepatitis, or pancreatitis have been reported with octreotide acetate injection therapy. In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. One patient developed ascending cholangitis during octreotide acetate injection therapy and died. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue octreotide acetate injection and treat appropriately. 5.3 Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia Octreotide acetate injection alters the balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon and GH, which may result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia which occurs during octreotide acetate injection therapy is usually mild but may result in overt diabetes mellitus or necessitate dose changes in insulin or other anti-diabetic agents. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred on octreotide acetate injection in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Severe hyperglycemia, subsequent pneumonia, and death following initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy was reported in one patient with no history of hyperglycemia. Monitor glucose levels during octreotide acetate injection therapy. Adjust dosing of insulin or other anti-diabetic therapy accordingly. 5.4 Thyroid Function Abnormalities Octreotide suppresses secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which may result in hypothyroidism. Baseline and periodic assessment of thyroid function (TSH, total, and/or free T4) is recommended during chronic therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 5.5 Nutrition Octreotide acetate injection may alter absorption of dietary fats. Depressed vitamin B 12 levels and abnormal Schilling\u2019s tests have been observed in some patients receiving octreotide acetate injection therapy, and monitoring of vitamin B 12 levels is recommended during octreotide acetate injection therapy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) in patients with acromegaly are gallbladder abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, abdominal discomfort, hyperglycemia, and hypothyroidism. In other patients, most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) are gallbladder abnormalities. ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-845-0689, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Gallbladder Abnormalities Gallbladder abnormalities, especially stones and/or biliary sludge, frequently develop in patients on chronic octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. Cardiac In acromegalics, sinus bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias developed in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Gastrointestinal Diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, and abdominal discomfort were each seen in 34% to 61% of acromegalic patients in U.S. studies. 2.6% of the patients discontinued therapy due to these symptoms. These symptoms were seen in 5% to 10% of patients with carcinoid tumors and VIPomas. The frequency of these symptoms was not dose related, but diarrhea and abdominal discomfort generally resolved more quickly in patients treated with 300 mcg/day than in those treated with 750 mcg/day. Vomiting, flatulence, abnormal stools, abdominal distention, and constipation were each seen in less than 10% of patients. In rare instances, gastrointestinal side effects may resemble acute intestinal obstruction, with progressive abdominal distension, severe epigastric pain, abdominal tenderness, and guarding. Hypo/Hyperglycemia Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively, but only in about 1.5% of other patients. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were noted in approximately 2% of patients. Hypothyroidism In acromegalics, biochemical hypothyroidism alone occurred in 12% while goiter occurred in 8% and 4% required initiation of thyroid replacement therapy during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . In patients without acromegaly, hypothyroidism has only been reported in several isolated patients and goiter has not been reported. Other Adverse Events Pain on injection was reported in 7.7%, headache in 6%, and dizziness in 5%. Pancreatitis was also observed [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Other Adverse Events 1% to 4% Other events, each observed in 1% to 4% of patients, included fatigue, weakness, pruritus, joint pain, backache, urinary tract infection, cold symptoms, flu symptoms, injection site hematoma, bruise, edema, flushing, blurred vision, pollakiuria, fat malabsorption, hair loss, visual disturbance, and depression. Anaphylactoid reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported in several patients receiving octreotide acetate injection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of octreotide acetate injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary: cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cholangitis and pancreatitis, which have sometimes required Cholecystectomy Gastrointestinal: intestinal obstruction Hematologic: thrombocytopenia"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The following drugs require monitoring and possible dose adjustment when used with octreotide acetate injection: cyclosporine, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, beta-blockers, and bromocriptine. ( 7 ) Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection: Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Cyclosporine Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. Concomitant administration of octreotide acetate injection with cyclosporine may decrease blood levels of cyclosporine and result in transplant rejection. 7.2 Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Drugs Octreotide inhibits the secretion of insulin and glucagon. Therefore, blood glucose levels should be monitored when octreotide acetate injection treatment is initiated or when the dose is altered and anti-diabetic treatment should be adjusted accordingly. 7.3 Bromocriptine Concomitant administration of octreotide and bromocriptine increases the availability of bromocriptine. 7.4 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy Concomitant administration of bradycardia-inducing drugs (e.g., beta-blockers) may have an additive effect on the reduction of heart rate associated with octreotide. Dose adjustments of concomitant medication may be necessary. Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. 7.5 Drug Metabolism Interactions Limited published data indicate that somatostatin analogs might decrease the metabolic clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which may be due to the suppression of GH. Since it cannot be excluded that octreotide may have this effect, other drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and which have a low therapeutic index (e.g., quinidine, terfenadine) should therefore be used with caution. 7.6 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection Octreotide competitively binds to somatostatin receptors and may interfere with the efficacy of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited data with octreotide acetate injection in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental-effects were observed with IV administration of octreotide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 7- and 13-times, respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.5 mg/day based on body surface area (BSA). Transient growth retardation, with no impact on postnatal development, was observed in rat offspring from a pre- and post-natal study of octreotide at IV doses below the MRHD based on BSA ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In postmarketing data, a limited number of exposed pregnancies have been reported in patients with acromegaly. Most women were exposed to octreotide during the first trimester of pregnancy at doses ranging from 100 to 300 mcg/day of octreotide acetate injection or 20 mg to 30 mg once a month of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, however some women elected to continue octreotide therapy throughout pregnancy. In cases with a known outcome, no congenital malformations were reported. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received IV doses of octreotide up to 1 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. A slight reduction in body weight gain was noted in pregnant rats at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day. There were no maternal effects in rabbits or embryo-fetal effects in either species up to the maximum dose tested. At 1 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, the dose multiple was approximately 7- and 13-times, respectively, at the highest recommended human dose of 1.5 mg/day based on BSA. In a pre- and post-natal development rat study at IV doses of 0.02-1 mg/kg/day, a transient growth retardation of the offspring was observed at all doses which was possibly a consequence of GH inhibition by octreotide. The doses attributed to the delayed growth are below the human dose of 1.5 mg/day, based on BSA. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of octreotide acetate injection in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies show that octreotide administered subcutaneously passes into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk ( see Data ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for octreotide acetate injection, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from octreotide acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Following a subcutaneous dose (1 mg/kg) of octreotide to lactating rats, transfer of octreotide into milk was observed at a low concentration compared to plasma (milk/plasma ratio of 0.009). 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as the therapeutic benefits of a reduction in GH levels and normalization of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration in acromegalic females treated with octreotide may lead to improved fertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of octreotide acetate injection in the pediatric population have not been demonstrated. No formal controlled clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of octreotide acetate injection in pediatric patients under age 6 years. In postmarketing reports, serious adverse events, including hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death, have been reported with octreotide acetate injection use in children, most notably in children under 2 years of age. The relationship of these events to octreotide has not been established as the majority of these pediatric patients had serious underlying co-morbid conditions. The efficacy and safety of octreotide acetate injection using the octreotide acetate for injectable suspension formulation was examined in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6 month pharmacokinetics study in 60 pediatric patients age 6 to 17 years with hypothalamic obesity resulting from cranial insult. The mean octreotide concentration after 6 doses of 40 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by intramuscular (IM) injection every 4 weeks was approximately 3 ng/mL. Steady-state concentrations was achieved after 3 injections of a 40-mg dose. Mean body mass index (BMI) increased 0.1 kg/m 2 in octreotide acetate for injectable suspension-treated subjects compared to 0.0 kg/m 2 in saline control-treated subjects. Efficacy was not demonstrated. Diarrhea occurred in 11 of 30 (37%) patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. No unexpected adverse events were observed. However, with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adult indications such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was 10 mg to 30 mg once a month. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of octreotide acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, the half-life of octreotide acetate may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage. [See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 8.7 Hepatic Impairment-Cirrhotic Patients In patients with liver cirrhosis, the half-life of the drug may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited data with octreotide acetate injection in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental-effects were observed with IV administration of octreotide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 7- and 13-times, respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.5 mg/day based on body surface area (BSA). Transient growth retardation, with no impact on postnatal development, was observed in rat offspring from a pre- and post-natal study of octreotide at IV doses below the MRHD based on BSA ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In postmarketing data, a limited number of exposed pregnancies have been reported in patients with acromegaly. Most women were exposed to octreotide during the first trimester of pregnancy at doses ranging from 100 to 300 mcg/day of octreotide acetate injection or 20 mg to 30 mg once a month of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, however some women elected to continue octreotide therapy throughout pregnancy. In cases with a known outcome, no congenital malformations were reported. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received IV doses of octreotide up to 1 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. A slight reduction in body weight gain was noted in pregnant rats at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day. There were no maternal effects in rabbits or embryo-fetal effects in either species up to the maximum dose tested. At 1 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, the dose multiple was approximately 7- and 13-times, respectively, at the highest recommended human dose of 1.5 mg/day based on BSA. In a pre- and post-natal development rat study at IV doses of 0.02-1 mg/kg/day, a transient growth retardation of the offspring was observed at all doses which was possibly a consequence of GH inhibition by octreotide. The doses attributed to the delayed growth are below the human dose of 1.5 mg/day, based on BSA."

      "8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of octreotide acetate injection in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies show that octreotide administered subcutaneously passes into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk ( see Data ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for octreotide acetate injection, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from octreotide acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Following a subcutaneous dose (1 mg/kg) of octreotide to lactating rats, transfer of octreotide into milk was observed at a low concentration compared to plasma (milk/plasma ratio of 0.009)."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of octreotide acetate injection in the pediatric population have not been demonstrated. No formal controlled clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of octreotide acetate injection in pediatric patients under age 6 years. In postmarketing reports, serious adverse events, including hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death, have been reported with octreotide acetate injection use in children, most notably in children under 2 years of age. The relationship of these events to octreotide has not been established as the majority of these pediatric patients had serious underlying co-morbid conditions. The efficacy and safety of octreotide acetate injection using the octreotide acetate for injectable suspension formulation was examined in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6 month pharmacokinetics study in 60 pediatric patients age 6 to 17 years with hypothalamic obesity resulting from cranial insult. The mean octreotide concentration after 6 doses of 40 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by intramuscular (IM) injection every 4 weeks was approximately 3 ng/mL. Steady-state concentrations was achieved after 3 injections of a 40-mg dose. Mean body mass index (BMI) increased 0.1 kg/m 2 in octreotide acetate for injectable suspension-treated subjects compared to 0.0 kg/m 2 in saline control-treated subjects. Efficacy was not demonstrated. Diarrhea occurred in 11 of 30 (37%) patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. No unexpected adverse events were observed. However, with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adult indications such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was 10 mg to 30 mg once a month."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Octreotide acetate injection a cyclic octapeptide prepared as a clear sterile solution of octreotide, acetate salt, in a buffered lactic acid solution for administration by deep subcutaneous (intrafat) or intravenous (IV) injection. Octreotide acetate, known chemically as L- Cysteinamide, D-phenylalanyl-L-cysteinyl-L-phenylalanyl-D-tryptophyl-L-lysyl-L-threonyl-N-[2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl) propyl]-,cyclic (2 \u2192 7)-disulfide; [R-(R*, R*)] acetate salt, is a long-acting octapeptide with pharmacologic actions mimicking those of the natural hormone somatostatin. Octreotide acetate injection is available as sterile 1 mL vials in 3 strengths, each mL containing 50 mcg, 100 mcg, or 500 mcg of octreotide (as acetate) as the active and the following inactive ingredients: L-lactic acid 3 mg, sodium chloride 7 mg, sodium hydroxide, and water for injection, q.s. Octreotide acetate injection is also available as sterile 5 mL multiple dose vials in 2 strengths, each mL containing 200 mcg or 1,000 mcg of octreotide (as acetate) as the active and the following inactive ingredients: L-lactic acid 3 mg, sodium chloride 7 mg, sodium hydroxide, and water for injection, q.s. Phenol 5 mg has been added as a preservative. L-Lactic acid and sodium hydroxide are added to provide a buffered solution, pH range 3.9 to 4.5. The molecular weight of octreotide acetate is 1019.3 g/mol (free peptide, C 49 H 66 N 10 O 10 S 2 ) and its amino acid sequence is: octreotide structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Octreotide acetate injection exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin. It is an even more potent inhibitor of GH, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it also suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, VIP, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide. By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and VIP secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Octreotide substantially reduces GH and/or IGF-1 (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly. Single doses of octreotide have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Octreotide suppresses secretion of TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection, octreotide is absorbed rapidly and completely from the injection site. Peak concentrations of 5.2 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) were reached 0.4 hours after dosing. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, IV and subcutaneous doses were found to be bioequivalent. Peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) values were dose proportional after IV single doses up to 200 mcg and subcutaneous single doses up to 500 mcg and after subcutaneous multiple doses up to 500 mcg 3 times a day (1,500 mcg/day). In patients with acromegaly, a mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing. Distribution In healthy volunteers, the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (t\u03b11/2; = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 13.6 L, and the total body clearance ranged from 7 L/hr to 10 L/hr. In blood, the distribution into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner. Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. In patients with acromegaly, the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 21.6 \u00b1 8.5 L, and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h. The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%. Elimination The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 to 1.9 hours compared with 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone. The duration of action of octreotide acetate injection is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor. About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine. In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug. In patients with acromegaly, the disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normal subjects. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with mild renal impairment (CLCR 40 to 60 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 2.4 hours and total body clearance was 8.8 L/hr, in moderate impairment (CLCR 10 to 39 mL/min) t 1/2 was 3.0 hours and total body clearance 7.3 L/hr. In patients with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis (CLCR < 10 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 3.1 hours and total body clearance was 7.6 L/hr. In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, total body clearance was reduced to about half that found in healthy subjects (from approximately 10 L/hr to 4.5 L/hr). Hepatic Impairment Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide t 1/2 increasing to 3.7 hr and total body clearance decreasing to 5.9 L/hr, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed t 1/2 increased to 3.4 hr and total body clearance of 8.2 L/hr. 12.6 Immunogenicity Evaluation of 20 patients treated for at least 6 months has failed to demonstrate titers of antibodies exceeding background levels. However, antibody titers to octreotide acetate injection were subsequently reported in 3 patients and resulted in prolonged duration of drug action in 2 patients."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated no mutagenic potential of octreotide acetate injection. No carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in mice treated subcutaneously for 85 to 99 weeks at doses up to 2,000 mcg/kg/day (8 x the human exposure based on BSA). In a 116-week subcutaneous study in rats, a 27% and 12% incidence of injection-site sarcomas or squamous cell carcinomas was observed in males and females, respectively, at the highest dose level of 1,250 mcg/kg/day (10 x the human exposure based on BSA) compared to an incidence of 8% to 10% in the vehicle-control groups. The increased incidence of injection-site tumors was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to repeated subcutaneous injections at the same site. Rotating injection sites would prevent chronic irritation in humans. There have been no reports of injection-site tumors in patients treated with octreotide acetate for up to 5 years. There was also a 15% incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas in the 1,250 mcg/kg/day females compared to 7% in the saline-control females and 0% in the vehicle-control females. The presence of endometritis coupled with the absence of corpora lutea, the reduction in mammary fibroadenomas, and the presence of uterine dilatation suggest that the uterine tumors were associated with estrogen dominance in the aged female rats which does not occur in humans. Octreotide did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 1,000 mcg/kg/day, which represents 7-times the human exposure based on BSA."

( 2.2 ) Carcinoid Tumors : Recommended dosage range of 100 mcg to 600 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.3 ) VIPomas : Recommended dosage range of 200 mcg to 300 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Dosage and Administration Overview Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. Pain with subcutaneous administration may be reduced by using the smallest volume that will deliver the desired dose. Sites should be rotated in a systematic manner. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if particulates and/or discoloration are observed. Octreotide acetate injection is not compatible in Total Parenteral Nutrition solutions because of the formation of a glycosyl octreotide conjugate which may decrease the efficacy of the product. Octreotide acetate injection may be diluted in volumes of 50 mL to 200 mL and infused intravenously over 15 to 30 minutes or administered by intravenous (IV) push over 3 minutes. In emergency situations (e.g., carcinoid crisis), it may be given by rapid bolus. Assess total and/or free T4 levels at baseline and periodically during chronic octreotide acetate injection therapy. 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Acromegaly The recommended initial dosage of octreotide acetate injection is 50 mcg three times daily to be administered subcutaneously. Increase octreotide acetate injection dose based upon GH or IGF-1 levels. The goal is to achieve GH levels less than 5 ng/mL or IGF-1 levels within normal range. Monitor GH or IGF-1 every two weeks after initiating octreotide acetate injection therapy or with dosage change, and to guide titration. The most common dosage is 100 mcg three times daily, but some patients require up to 500 mcg three times daily for maximum effectiveness. Doses greater than 300 mcg/day seldom result in additional biochemical benefit, and if an increase in dose fails to provide additional benefit, the dose should be reduced. Octreotide acetate injection should be withdrawn yearly for approximately 4 weeks from patients who have received irradiation to assess disease activity. If GH or IGF-1 levels increase and signs and symptoms recur, octreotide acetate injection therapy may be resumed. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Carcinoid Tumors The recommended daily dosage of octreotide acetate injection during the first 2 weeks of therapy ranges from 100 to 600 mcg/day in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously (mean daily dosage is 300 mcg). In the clinical studies, the median daily maintenance dosage was approximately 450 mcg, but clinical and biochemical benefits were obtained in some patients with as little as 50 mcg, while others required doses up to 1500 mcg/day. However, experience with doses above 750 mcg/day is limited. Measurement of urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, plasma serotonin, plasma Substance P may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy. 2.4 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors Daily dosages of 200 mcg to 300 mcg in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously are recommended during the initial 2 weeks of therapy (range, 150 mcg to 750 mcg) to control symptoms of the disease. On an individual basis, dosage may be adjusted to achieve a therapeutic response, but usually doses above 450 mcg/day are not required. Measurement of Plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac Function Abnormalities : Increased risk for higher degree of atrioventricular blocks. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Bradycardia, arrhythmias, or conduction abnormalities may occur. Use with caution in at-risk patients. Dosage adjustment of cardiac medications may be necessary. ( 5.1 ) Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis : Monitor periodically. Discontinue if complications of cholelithiasis are suspected. ( 5.2 ) Glucose Metabolism : Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia may occur. Glucose monitoring is recommended and anti-diabetic treatment may need adjustment. ( 5.3 ) Thyroid Function : Hypothyroidism may occur. Monitor thyroid levels periodically. ( 5.4 ) Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats : New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss may occur. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported, evaluate for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Cardiac Function Abnormalities Complete Atrioventricular Block Patients who receive octreotide acetate injection intravenously may be at increased risk for higher degree atrioventricular blocks. In postmarketing reports, complete atrioventricular block was reported in patients receiving IV octreotide acetate injection during surgical procedures. In the majority of patients, octreotide acetate injection was given at higher than recommended doses and/or as a continuous IV infusion. The safety of continuous IV infusion has not been established in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection for the approved indications. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Other Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities Other cardiac conduction abnormalities have occurred during treatment with octreotide acetate injection. In acromegalic patients, bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias occurred in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . Other electrocardiogram (ECG) changes observed included QT prolongation, axis shifts, early repolarization, low voltage, R/S transition, and early R-wave progression. These ECG changes are not uncommon in acromegalic patients. Dose adjustments in drugs such as beta-blockers that have bradycardia effects may be necessary. In one acromegalic patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy resulted in worsening of CHF with improvement when drug was discontinued. Confirmation of a drug effect was obtained with a positive rechallenge. 5.2 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis Octreotide acetate injection may inhibit gallbladder contractility and decrease bile secretion, which may lead to gallbladder abnormalities or sludge. Acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, biliary obstruction, cholestatic hepatitis, or pancreatitis have been reported with octreotide acetate injection therapy. In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. One patient developed ascending cholangitis during octreotide acetate injection therapy and died. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue octreotide acetate injection and treat appropriately. 5.3 Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia Octreotide acetate injection alters the balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon and GH, which may result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia which occurs during octreotide acetate injection therapy is usually mild but may result in overt diabetes mellitus or necessitate dose changes in insulin or other anti-diabetic agents. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred on octreotide acetate injection in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . Severe hyperglycemia, subsequent pneumonia, and death following initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy was reported in one patient with no history of hyperglycemia. Monitor glucose levels during octreotide acetate injection therapy. Adjust dosing of insulin or other anti-diabetic therapy accordingly. 5.4 Thyroid Function Abnormalities Octreotide suppresses secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which may result in hypothyroidism. Baseline and periodic assessment of thyroid function (TSH, total, and/or free T 4 ) is recommended during chronic therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . 5.5 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration and loose stools have been reported in patients receiving somatostatin analogs, including octreotide acetate injection. Somatostatin analogs reversibly inhibit secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile acids, which may result in malabsorption of dietary fats and subsequent symptoms of steatorrhea, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection, evaluate patients for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and manage accordingly. 5.6 Changes in Vitamin B12 Levels Depressed vitamin B 12 levels and abnormal Schilling\u2019s tests have been observed in some patients receiving octreotide acetate injection therapy, and monitoring of vitamin B 12 levels is recommended during octreotide acetate injection therapy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) in patients with acromegaly are gallbladder abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, abdominal discomfort, hyperglycemia, and hypothyroidism. In other patients, most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) are gallbladder abnormalities. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hainan Shuangcheng Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. at 86-0898-6856-1216 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Complete Atrioventricular Block [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Thyroid Function Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Changes in Vitamin B12 Levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Gallbladder Abnormalities Gallbladder abnormalities, especially stones and/or biliary sludge, frequently develop in patients on chronic octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. Cardiac In acromegalics, sinus bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias developed in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Gastrointestinal Diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, and abdominal discomfort were each seen in 34% to 61% of acromegalic patients in U.S. studies. 2.6% of the patients discontinued therapy due to these symptoms. These symptoms were seen in 5% to 10% of patients with carcinoid tumors and VIPomas. The frequency of these symptoms was not dose related, but diarrhea and abdominal discomfort generally resolved more quickly in patients treated with 300 mcg/day than in those treated with 750 mcg/day. Vomiting, flatulence, abnormal stools, abdominal distention, and constipation were each seen in less than 10% of patients. In rare instances, gastrointestinal side effects may resemble acute intestinal obstruction, with progressive abdominal distension, severe epigastric pain, abdominal tenderness, and guarding. Hypo/Hyperglycemia Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively, but only in about 1.5% of other patients. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were noted in approximately 2% of patients. Hypothyroidism In acromegalics, biochemical hypothyroidism alone occurred in 12% while goiter occurred in 8% and 4% required initiation of thyroid replacement therapy during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . In patients without acromegaly, hypothyroidism has only been reported in several isolated patients and goiter has not been reported. Other Adverse Events Pain on injection was reported in 7.7%, headache in 6%, and dizziness in 5%. Pancreatitis was also observed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Other Adverse Events 1% to 4% Other events, each observed in 1% to 4% of patients, included fatigue, weakness, pruritus, joint pain, backache, urinary tract infection, cold symptoms, flu symptoms, injection site hematoma, bruise, edema, flushing, blurred vision, pollakiuria, fat malabsorption, hair loss, visual disturbance, and depression. Anaphylactoid reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported in several patients receiving octreotide acetate injection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of octreotide acetate injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary : cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cholangitis and pancreatitis, which have sometimes required cholecystectomy Gastrointestinal : intestinal obstruction, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency Hematologic : thrombocytopenia"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The following drugs require monitoring and possible dose adjustment when used with octreotide acetate injection : cyclosporine, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, beta-blockers, and bromocriptine. ( 7 ) Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection : Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Cyclosporine Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. Concomitant administration of octreotide acetate injection with cyclosporine may decrease blood levels of cyclosporine and result in transplant rejection. 7.2 Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Drugs Octreotide inhibits the secretion of insulin and glucagon. Therefore, blood glucose levels should be monitored when octreotide acetate injection treatment is initiated or when the dose is altered and anti-diabetic treatment should be adjusted accordingly. 7.3 Bromocriptine Concomitant administration of octreotide and bromocriptine increases the availability of bromocriptine. 7.4 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy Concomitant administration of bradycardia-inducing drugs (e.g., beta-blockers) may have an additive effect on the reduction of heart rate associated with octreotide. Dose adjustments of concomitant medication may be necessary. Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. 7.5 Drug Metabolism Interactions Limited published data indicate that somatostatin analogs might decrease the metabolic clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which may be due to the suppression of GH. Since it cannot be excluded that octreotide may have this effect, other drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and which have a low therapeutic index (e.g., quinidine, terfenadine) should therefore be used with caution. 7.6 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection Octreotide competitively binds to somatostatin receptors and may interfere with the efficacy of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited data with octreotide acetate injection in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental-effects were observed with IV administration of octreotide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 7- and 13-times, respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.5 mg/day based on body surface area (BSA). Transient growth retardation, with no impact on postnatal development, was observed in rat offspring from a pre- and post-natal study of octreotide at IV doses below the MRHD based on BSA ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In postmarketing data, a limited number of exposed pregnancies have been reported in patients with acromegaly. Most women were exposed to octreotide during the first trimester of pregnancy at doses ranging from 100 to 300 mcg/day of octreotide acetate injection or 20 mg to 30 mg once a month of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, however some women elected to continue octreotide therapy throughout pregnancy. In cases with a known outcome, no congenital malformations were reported. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received IV doses of octreotide up to 1 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. A slight reduction in body weight gain was noted in pregnant rats at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day. There were no maternal effects in rabbits or embryo-fetal effects in either species up to the maximum dose tested. At 1 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, the dose multiple was approximately 7- and 13-times, respectively, at the highest recommended human dose of 1.5 mg/day based on BSA. In a pre- and post-natal development rat study at IV doses of 0.02-1 mg/kg/day, a transient growth retardation of the offspring was observed at all doses which was possibly a consequence of GH inhibition by octreotide. The doses attributed to the delayed growth are below the human dose of 1.5 mg/day, based on BSA. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of octreotide acetate injection in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies show that octreotide administered subcutaneously passes into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk ( see Data ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for octreotide acetate injection, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from octreotide acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Following a subcutaneous dose (1 mg/kg) of octreotide to lactating rats, transfer of octreotide into milk was observed at a low concentration compared to plasma (milk/plasma ratio of 0.009). 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as the therapeutic benefits of a reduction in GH levels and normalization of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration in acromegalic females treated with octreotide may lead to improved fertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of octreotide acetate injection in the pediatric population have not been demonstrated. No formal controlled clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of octreotide acetate injection in pediatric patients under age 6 years. In postmarketing reports, serious adverse events, including hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death, have been reported with octreotide acetate injection use in children, most notably in children under 2 years of age. The relationship of these events to octreotide has not been established as the majority of these pediatric patients had serious underlying co-morbid conditions. The efficacy and safety of octreotide acetate injection using the octreotide acetate for injectable suspension formulation was examined in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6 month pharmacokinetics study in 60 pediatric patients age 6 to 17 years with hypothalamic obesity resulting from cranial insult. The mean octreotide concentration after 6 doses of 40 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by intramuscular (IM) injection every 4 weeks was approximately 3 ng/mL. Steady-state concentrations was achieved after 3 injections of a 40-mg dose. Mean body mass index (BMI) increased 0.1 kg/m 2 in octreotide acetate for injectable suspension-treated subjects compared to 0.0 kg/m 2 in saline control-treated subjects. Efficacy was not demonstrated. Diarrhea occurred in 11 of 30 (37%) patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. No unexpected adverse events were observed. However, with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adult indications such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was 10 mg to 30 mg once a month. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of octreotide acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, the half-life of octreotide acetate injection may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment-Cirrhotic Patients In patients with liver cirrhosis, the half-life of the drug may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Octreotide acetate injection, a cyclic octapeptide prepared as a clear sterile solution of octreotide, acetate salt, in a buffered lactic acid solution for administration by deep subcutaneous or IV injection. Octreotide acetate, known chemically as L-Cysteinamide, D-phenylalanyl-L-cysteinyl-L-phenylalanyl-D-tryptophyl-L-lysyl-L-threonyl-N-[2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)propyl]-,cyclic (2 \u2192 7)-disulfide; [R-(R*, R*)] acetate salt, is a long-acting octapeptide with pharmacologic actions mimicking those of the natural hormone somatostatin. Octreotide acetate injection is available as sterile 1-mL single-dose vials in one strength, containing 100 mcg octreotide (as acetate). Each single-dose vial also contains L-lactic acid, USP (3.4 mg), mannitol, USP (45 mg), sodium bicarbonate, USP (quantity sufficient to pH 4.2 \u00b1 0.3), water for injection, USP (quantity sufficient to 1 mL). Lactic acid and sodium bicarbonate are added to provide a buffered solution, pH to 4.2 \u00b1 0.3. The molecular weight of octreotide acetate is 1019.3 g/mol (free peptide, C 49 H 66 N 10 O 10 S 2 ) and its amino acid sequence is: octreotide acetate amino acid sequence"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Octreotide acetate injection exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin. It is an even more potent inhibitor of GH, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it also suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, VIP, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide. By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and VIP secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Octreotide substantially reduces GH and/or IGF-1 (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly. Single doses of octreotide have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Octreotide suppresses secretion of TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection, octreotide is absorbed rapidly and completely from the injection site. Peak concentrations of 5.2 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) were reached 0.4 hours after dosing. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, IV and subcutaneous doses were found to be bioequivalent. Peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) values were dose proportional after IV single doses up to 200 mcg and subcutaneous single doses up to 500 mcg and after subcutaneous multiple doses up to 500 mcg 3 times a day (1,500 mcg/day). In patients with acromegaly, a mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing. Distribution In healthy volunteers, the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (t\u03b1\u00bd = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 13.6 L, and the total body clearance ranged from 7 L/hr to 10 L/hr. In blood, the distribution into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner. Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. In patients with acromegaly, the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 21.6 \u00b1 8.5 L, and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h. The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%. Elimination The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 to 1.9 hours compared with 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone. The duration of action of octreotide acetate injection is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor. About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine. In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug. In patients with acromegaly, the disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normal subjects. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR 40 to 60 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 2.4 hours and total body clearance was 8.8 L/hr, in moderate impairment (CL CR 10 to 39 mL/min) t 1/2 was 3.0 hours and total body clearance 7.3 L/hr. In patients with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis (CL CR < 10 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 3.1 hours and total body clearance was 7.6 L/hr. In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, total body clearance was reduced to about half that found in healthy subjects (from approximately 10 L/hr to 4.5 L/hr). Hepatic Impairment Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide t 1/2 increasing to 3.7 hr and total body clearance decreasing to 5.9 L/hr, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed t 1/2 increased to 3.4 hr and total body clearance of 8.2 L/hr. 12.6 Immunogenicity Evaluation of 20 patients treated for at least 6 months has failed to demonstrate titers of antibodies exceeding background levels. However, antibody titers to octreotide acetate injection were subsequently reported in 3 patients and resulted in prolonged duration of drug action in 2 patients."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Octreotide acetate injection exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin. It is an even more potent inhibitor of GH, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it also suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, VIP, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide. By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and VIP secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea)."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Octreotide substantially reduces GH and/or IGF-1 (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly. Single doses of octreotide have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Octreotide suppresses secretion of TSH."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection, octreotide is absorbed rapidly and completely from the injection site. Peak concentrations of 5.2 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) were reached 0.4 hours after dosing. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, IV and subcutaneous doses were found to be bioequivalent. Peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) values were dose proportional after IV single doses up to 200 mcg and subcutaneous single doses up to 500 mcg and after subcutaneous multiple doses up to 500 mcg 3 times a day (1,500 mcg/day). In patients with acromegaly, a mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing. Distribution In healthy volunteers, the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (t\u03b1\u00bd = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 13.6 L, and the total body clearance ranged from 7 L/hr to 10 L/hr. In blood, the distribution into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner. Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. In patients with acromegaly, the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 21.6 \u00b1 8.5 L, and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h. The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%. Elimination The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 to 1.9 hours compared with 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone. The duration of action of octreotide acetate injection is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor. About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine. In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug. In patients with acromegaly, the disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normal subjects. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR 40 to 60 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 2.4 hours and total body clearance was 8.8 L/hr, in moderate impairment (CL CR 10 to 39 mL/min) t 1/2 was 3.0 hours and total body clearance 7.3 L/hr. In patients with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis (CL CR < 10 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 3.1 hours and total body clearance was 7.6 L/hr. In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, total body clearance was reduced to about half that found in healthy subjects (from approximately 10 L/hr to 4.5 L/hr). Hepatic Impairment Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide t 1/2 increasing to 3.7 hr and total body clearance decreasing to 5.9 L/hr, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed t 1/2 increased to 3.4 hr and total body clearance of 8.2 L/hr."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated no mutagenic potential of octreotide acetate injection. No carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in mice treated subcutaneously for 85 to 99 weeks at doses up to 2,000 mcg/kg/day (8 x the human exposure based on BSA). In a 116-week subcutaneous study in rats, a 27% and 12% incidence of injection-site sarcomas or squamous cell carcinomas was observed in males and females, respectively, at the highest dose level of 1,250 mcg/kg/day (10 x the human exposure based on BSA) compared to an incidence of 8% to 10% in the vehicle-control groups. The increased incidence of injection-site tumors was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to repeated subcutaneous injections at the same site. Rotating injection sites would prevent chronic irritation in humans. There have been no reports of injection-site tumors in patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for up to 5 years. There was also a 15% incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas in the 1,250 mcg/kg/day females compared to 7% in the saline-control females and 0% in the vehicle-control females. The presence of endometritis coupled with the absence of corpora lutea, the reduction in mammary fibroadenomas, and the presence of uterine dilatation suggest that the uterine tumors were associated with estrogen dominance in the aged female rats which does not occur in humans. Octreotide did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 1,000 mcg/kg/day, which represents 7-times the human exposure based on BSA."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension should be administered by a trained healthcare provider. It is important to closely follow the mixing instructions included in the packaging. Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension must be administered immediately after mixing. Do not directly inject diluent without preparing suspension. The recommended needle size for administration of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension is the 1\u00bd\u201d 19 gauge safety injection needle (supplied in the drug product kit). For patients with a greater skin to muscle depth, a size 2\u201d 19 gauge needle (not supplied) may be used. Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension should be administered intramuscularly (IM) in the gluteal region at 4-week intervals. Administration of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at intervals greater than 4 weeks is not recommended. Injection sites should be rotated in a systematic manner to avoid irritation. Deltoid injections should be avoided due to significant discomfort at the injection site when given in that area. Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension should never be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. The following dosage regimens are recommended. Patients Not Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Injection Subcutaneously: Acromegaly: 50 mcg three times daily octreotide acetate injection subcutaneously for 2 weeks followed by octreotide acetate for injectable suspension 20 mg intragluteally every 4 weeks for 3 months ( 2.1 ) Carcinoid Tumors and VIPomas: Octreotide acetate injection subcutaneously 100 mcg/day to 600 mcg/day in 2 to 4 divided doses for 2 weeks followed by octreotide acetate for injectable suspension 20 mg every 4 weeks for 2 months ( 2.2 ) Patients Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Injection Subcutaneously: Acromegaly: 20 mg every 4 weeks for 3 months ( 2.1 ) Carcinoid Tumors and VIPomas: 20 mg every 4 weeks for 2 months ( 2.2 ) Renal Impairment, Patients on Dialysis: 10 mg every 4 weeks ( 2.3 ) Hepatic Impairment, Patients with Cirrhosis: 10 mg every 4 weeks ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Acromegaly Patients Not Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Patients not currently receiving octreotide acetate should begin therapy with octreotide acetate injection given subcutaneously in an initial dose of 50 mcg three times daily which may be titrated. Most patients require doses of 100 mcg to 200 mcg three times daily for maximum effect but some patients require up to 500 mcg three times daily. Patients should be maintained on octreotide acetate injection subcutaneous for at least 2 weeks to determine tolerance to octreotide acetate. Patients who are considered to be \u201cresponders\u201d to the drug, based on GH and IGF-1 levels and who tolerate the drug, can then be switched to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in the dosage scheme described below (Patients Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Injection). Patients Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Injection Patients currently receiving octreotide acetate injection can be switched directly to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in a dose of 20 mg given IM intragluteally at 4-week intervals for 3 months. After 3 months, dosage may be adjusted as follows: GH \u2264 2.5 ng/mL, IGF-1 normal, and clinical symptoms controlled: maintain octreotide acetate for injectable suspension dosage at 20 mg every 4 weeks GH > 2.5 ng/mL, IGF-1 elevated, and/or clinical symptoms uncontrolled, increase octreotide acetate for injectable suspension dosage to 30 mg every 4 weeks GH \u2264 1 ng/mL, IGF-1 normal, and clinical symptoms controlled, reduce octreotide acetate for injectable suspension dosage to 10 mg every 4 weeks If GH, IGF-1, or symptoms are not adequately controlled at a dose of 30 mg, the dose may be increased to 40 mg every 4 weeks. Doses higher than 40 mg are not recommended. In patients who have received pituitary irradiation, octreotide acetate for injectable suspension should be withdrawn yearly for approximately 8 weeks to assess disease activity. If GH or IGF-1 levels increase and signs and symptoms recur, octreotide acetate for injectable suspension therapy may be resumed. 2.2 Carcinoid Tumors and VIPomas Patients Not Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Patients not currently receiving octreotide acetate should begin therapy with octreotide acetate injection given subcutaneously. The suggested daily dosage for carcinoid tumors during the first 2 weeks of therapy ranges from 100 mcg/day to 600 mcg/day in 2 to 4 divided doses (mean daily dosage is 300 mcg). Some patients may require doses up to 1,500 mcg/day. The suggested daily dosage for VIPomas is 200 mcg to 300 mcg in 2 to 4 divided doses (range, 150 mcg to 750 mcg); dosage may be adjusted on an individual basis to control symptoms but usually doses above 450 mcg/day are not required. Octreotide acetate injection should be continued for at least 2 weeks. Thereafter, patients who are considered \u201cresponders\u201d to octreotide acetate, and who tolerate the drug, may be switched to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in the dosage regimen as described below (Patients Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Injection). Patients Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Injection Patients currently receiving octreotide acetate injection can be switched to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in a dosage of 20 mg given IM intragluteally at 4-week intervals for 2 months. Because of the need for serum octreotide to reach therapeutically effective levels following initial injection of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, carcinoid tumor and VIPoma patients should continue to receive octreotide acetate injection subcutaneously for at least 2 weeks in the same dosage they were taking before the switch. Failure to continue subcutaneous injections for this period may result in exacerbation of symptoms (some patients may require 3 or 4 weeks of such therapy). After 2 months, dosage may be adjusted as follows: If symptoms are adequately controlled, consider a dose reduction to 10 mg for a trial period. If symptoms recur, dosage should then be increased to 20 mg every 4 weeks. Many patients can, however, be satisfactorily maintained at a 10-mg dose every 4 weeks. If symptoms are not adequately controlled, increase octreotide acetate for injectable suspension to 30 mg every 4 weeks. Patients who achieve good control on a 20-mg dose may have their dose lowered to 10 mg for a trial period. If symptoms recur, dosage should then be increased to 20 mg every 4 weeks. Dosages higher than 30 mg are not recommended. Despite good overall control of symptoms, patients with carcinoid tumors and VIPomas often experience periodic exacerbation of symptoms (regardless of whether they are being maintained on octreotide acetate injection or octreotide acetate for injectable suspension). During these periods, they may be given octreotide acetate injection subcutaneously for a few days at the dosage they were receiving prior to switching to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. When symptoms are again controlled, the octreotide acetate injection subcutaneous can be discontinued. 2.3 Special Populations: Renal Impairment In patients with renal failure requiring dialysis, the starting dose should be 10 mg every 4 weeks. In other patients with renal impairment, the starting dose should be similar to a nonrenal patient (i.e., 20 mg every 4 weeks) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 )] . 2.4 Special Populations: Hepatic Impairment \u2013 Cirrhotic Patients In patients with established cirrhosis of the liver, the starting dose should be 10 mg every 4 weeks [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis: Monitor periodically. Discontinue if complications of cholelithiasis are suspected ( 5.1 ) Glucose Metabolism: Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia may occur. Glucose monitoring is recommended and anti-diabetic treatment may need adjustment ( 5.2 ) Thyroid Function: Hypothyroidism may occur. Monitor thyroid levels periodically ( 5.3 ) Cardiac Function: Bradycardia, arrhythmia, or conduction abnormalities may occur. Use with caution in at-risk patients ( 5.4 ) Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats: New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss may occur. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported, evaluate for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension may inhibit gallbladder contractility and decrease bile secretion, which may lead to gallbladder abnormalities or sludge. There have been postmarketing reports of cholelithiasis (gallstones) resulting in complications, including cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis and requiring cholecystectomy in patients taking octreotide acetate for injectable suspension [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Patients should be monitored periodically. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue octreotide acetate for injectable suspension and treat appropriately. 5.2 Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia Octreotide alters the balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone (GH), which may result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Blood glucose levels should be monitored when octreotide acetate for injectable suspension treatment is initiated, or when the dose is altered. Anti-diabetic treatment should be adjusted accordingly [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 5.3 Thyroid Function Abnormalities Octreotide suppresses the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which may result in hypothyroidism. Baseline and periodic assessment of thyroid function (TSH, total and/or free T 4 ) is recommended during chronic octreotide therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 5.4 Cardiac Function Abnormalities In both acromegalic and carcinoid syndrome patients, bradycardia, arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities have been reported during octreotide therapy. Other electrocardiogram (ECG) changes were observed such as QT prolongation, axis shifts, early repolarization, low voltage, R/S transition, early R wave progression, and nonspecific ST-T wave changes. The relationship of these events to octreotide acetate is not established because many of these patients have underlying cardiac disease. Dose adjustments in drugs such as beta-blockers that have bradycardic effects may be necessary. In one acromegalic patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), initiation of octreotide acetate injection-therapy resulted in worsening of CHF with improvement when drug was discontinued. Confirmation of a drug effect was obtained with a positive rechallenge [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 5.5 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration and loose stool have been reported in patients receiving somatostatin analogs, including octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Somatostatin analogs reversibly inhibit secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile acids, which may result in malabsorption of dietary fats and subsequent symptoms of steatorrhea, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported in patients receiving octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, evaluate patients for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and manage accordingly. 5.6 Changes in Vitamin B 12 Levels Depressed vitamin B 12 levels and abnormal Schilling tests have been observed in some patients receiving octreotide therapy, and monitoring of vitamin B 12 levels is recommended during therapy with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. 5.7 Changes in Zinc Levels Octreotide has been investigated for the reduction of excessive fluid loss from the GI tract in patients with conditions producing such a loss. If such patients are receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), serum zinc may rise excessively when the fluid loss is reversed. Patients on TPN and octreotide should have periodic monitoring of zinc levels. 5.8 Monitoring: Laboratory Tests Laboratory tests that may be helpful as biochemical markers in determining and following patient response depend on the specific tumor. Based on diagnosis, measurement of the following substances may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)] . Acromegaly: Growth Hormone, IGF-1 (somatomedin C) Carcinoid: 5-HIAA (urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid), plasma serotonin, plasma Substance P VIPoma: VIP (plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide) baseline and periodic total and/or free T 4 measurements should be performed during chronic therapy 5.9 Drug Interactions Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. Concomitant administration of octreotide injection with cyclosporine may decrease blood levels of cyclosporine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

Acromegaly The safety of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in the treatment of acromegaly has been evaluated in three Phase 3 studies in 261 patients, including 209 exposed for 48 weeks and 96 exposed for greater than 108 weeks. Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was studied primarily in a double-blind, cross-over manner. Patients on subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection were switched to the octreotide acetate for injectable suspension formulation followed by an open-label extension. The population age range was 14 to 81 years old and 53% were female. Approximately 35% of these acromegaly patients had not been treated with surgery and/or radiation. Most patients received a starting dose of 20 mg every 4 weeks intramuscularly. Dose was up or down titrated based on efficacy and tolerability to a final dose between 10 mg to 60 mg every 4 weeks. Table 1 below reflects adverse events from these studies regardless of presumed causality to study drug. Table 1. Adverse Events Occurring in \u2265 10% of Acromegalic Patients in the Phase 3 Studies WHO Preferred Term Phase 3 Studies (Pooled) Number (%) of Subjects with AEs 10 mg/20 mg/30 mg (n = 261) n (%) Diarrhea 93 (35.6) Abdominal Pain 75 (28.7) Flatulence 66 (25.3) Influenza-Like Symptoms 52 (19.9) Constipation 46 (17.6) Headache 40 (15.3) Anemia 40 (15.3) Injection-Site Pain 36 (13.8) Cholelithiasis 35 (13.4) Hypertension 33 (12.6) Dizziness 30 (11.5) Fatigue 29 (11.1) Abbreviation: AEs, adverse events. The safety of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in the treatment of acromegaly was also evaluated in a postmarketing randomized Phase 4 study. One-hundred four (104) patients were randomized to either pituitary surgery or 20 mg of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. All the patients were treatment na\u00efve (\u2018 de novo \u2019). Crossover was allowed according to treatment response and a total of 76 patients were exposed to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Approximately half of the patients initially randomized to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension were exposed to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension up to 1 year. The population age range was between 20 to 76 years old, 45% were female, 93% were Caucasian, and 1% Black. The majority of these patients were exposed to 30 mg every 4 weeks. Table 2 below reflects the adverse events occurring in this study regardless of presumed causality to study drug. Table 2. Adverse Events Occurring in \u2265 10% of Acromegalic Patients in Phase 4 Study WHO Preferred Term Phase 4 Study Octreotide Acetate for Injectable Suspension Phase 4 Study Surgery N = 76 N = 64 n (%) n (%) Diarrhea 36 (47.4) 2 (3.1) Cholelithiasis 29 (38.2) 3 (4.7) Abdominal Pain 19 (25.0) 2 (3.1) Nausea 12 (15.8) 5 (7.8) Alopecia 10 (13.2) 5 (7.8) Injection-Site Pain 9 (11.8) 0 Abdominal Pain Upper 8 (10.5) 0 Headache 8 (10.5) 6 (9.4) Epistaxis 0 7 (10.9) Gallbladder Abnormalities Single doses of octreotide acetate injection have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In clinical trials with octreotide acetate injection (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis) in patients who had not previously received octreotide acetate, the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. The incidence of gallbladder abnormalities did not appear to be related to age, sex, or dose but was related to duration of exposure. In clinical trials, 52% of acromegalic patients, most of whom received octreotide acetate for injectable suspension for 12 months or longer, developed new biliary abnormalities including gallstones, microlithiasis, sediment, sludge, and dilatation. The incidence of new cholelithiasis was 22%, of which 7% were microstones. Across all trials, a few patients developed acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, biliary obstruction, cholestatic hepatitis, or pancreatitis during octreotide therapy or following its withdrawal. One patient developed ascending cholangitis during octreotide acetate injection therapy and died. Despite the high incidence of new gallstones in patients receiving octreotide acetate, 1% of patients developed acute symptoms requiring cholecystectomy. Glucose Metabolism - Hypoglycemia/Hyperglycemia In acromegaly patients treated with either octreotide acetate injection or octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, hypoglycemia occurred in approximately 2% and hyperglycemia in approximately 15% of patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Hypothyroidism In acromegaly patients receiving octreotide acetate injection, 12% developed biochemical hypothyroidism, 8% developed goiter, and 4% required initiation of thyroid replacement therapy while receiving octreotide acetate injection. In acromegalic patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse event in 2% and goiter in 2%. Two patients receiving octreotide acetate for injectable suspension required initiation of thyroid hormone replacement therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Cardiac In acromegalic patients, sinus bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias developed in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection-therapy. The relationship of these events to octreotide acetate is not established because many of these patients have underlying cardiac disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Gastrointestinal The most common symptoms are gastrointestinal. The overall incidence of the most frequent of these symptoms in clinical trials of acromegalic patients treated for approximately 1 to 4 years is shown in Table 3. Table 3. Number (%) of Acromegalic Patients with Common GI Adverse Events Adverse Event Octreotide Acetate Injection S.C. Three Times Daily n = 114 Octreotide Acetate for Injectable Suspension Every 28 Days n = 261 n % n % Diarrhea 66 (57.9) 95 (36.4) Abdominal Pain or Discomfort 50 (43.9) 76 (29.1) Nausea 34 (29.8) 27 (10.3) Flatulence 15 (13.2) 67 (25.7) Constipation 10 (8.8) 49 (18.8) Vomiting 5 (4.4) 17 (6.5) Only 2.6% of the patients on octreotide acetate injection in U.S. clinical trials discontinued therapy due to these symptoms. No acromegalic patient receiving octreotide acetate for injectable suspension discontinued therapy for a GI event. In patients receiving octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, the incidence of diarrhea was dose related. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea developed primarily during the first month of treatment with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Thereafter, new cases of these events were uncommon. The vast majority of these events were mild-to-moderate in severity. In rare instances, gastrointestinal adverse effects may resemble acute intestinal obstruction, with progressive abdominal distention, severe epigastric pain, abdominal tenderness, and guarding. Dyspepsia, steatorrhea, discoloration of feces, and tenesmus were reported in 4% to 6% of patients. In a clinical trial of carcinoid syndrome, nausea, abdominal pain, and flatulence were reported in 27% to 38% and constipation or vomiting in 15% to 21% of patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Diarrhea was reported as an adverse event in 14% of patients, but since most of the patients had diarrhea as a symptom of carcinoid syndrome, it is difficult to assess the actual incidence of drug-related diarrhea. Pain at the Injection Site Pain on injection, which is generally mild-to-moderate, and short-lived (usually about 1 hour) is dose related, being reported by 2%, 9%, and 11% of acromegalic patients receiving doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg, respectively, of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. In carcinoid patients, where a diary was kept, pain at the injection site was reported by about 20% to 25% at a 10-mg dose and about 30% to 50% at the 20-mg and 30-mg dose. Antibodies to Octreotide Studies to date have shown that antibodies to octreotide develop in up to 25% of patients treated with octreotide acetate. These antibodies do not influence the degree of efficacy response to octreotide; however, in two acromegalic patients who received octreotide acetate injection, the duration of GH suppression following each injection was about twice as long as in patients without antibodies. It has not been determined whether octreotide antibodies will also prolong the duration of GH suppression in patients being treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Carcinoid and VIPomas The safety of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in the treatment of carcinoid tumors and VIPomas has been evaluated in one Phase 3 study. Study 1 randomized 93 patients with carcinoid syndrome to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg in a blind fashion or to open-label octreotide acetate injection subcutaneously. The population age range was between 25 to 78 years old and 44% were female, 95% were Caucasian and 3% Black. All the patients had symptom control on their previous octreotide acetate subcutaneous treatment. Eighty (80) patients finished the initial 24 weeks of octreotide acetate exposure in Study 1. In Study 1, comparable numbers of patients were randomized to each dose. Table 4 below reflects the adverse events occurring in \u2265 15% of patients regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

New gallstones occurred in a total of 24% of patients. Glucose Metabolism - Hypoglycemia/Hyperglycemia In carcinoid patients, hypoglycemia occurred in 4% and hyperglycemia in 27% of patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Hypothyroidism In carcinoid patients, hypothyroidism has only been reported in isolated patients and goiter has not been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Cardiac Electrocardiograms were performed only in carcinoid patients receiving octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. In carcinoid syndrome patients, sinus bradycardia developed in 19%, conduction abnormalities occurred in 9%, and arrhythmias developed in 3%. The relationship of these events to octreotide acetate is not established because many of these patients have underlying cardiac disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Other Clinical Studies Adverse Events Other clinically significant adverse events (relationship to drug not established) in acromegalic and/or carcinoid syndrome patients receiving octreotide acetate for injectable suspension were malignant hyperpyrexia, cerebral vascular disorder, rectal bleeding, ascites, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and pleural effusion. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during the postapproval use of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic: pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia Cardiac: myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation Ear and labyrinth: deafness Endocrine: diabetes insipidus, adrenal insufficiency in patients 18 months of age and under, pituitary apoplexy Eye: glaucoma, visual field defect, scotoma, retinal vein thrombosis Gastrointestinal: intestinal obstruction, peptic/gastric ulcer, abdomen enlarged, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency General and administration site: generalized edema, facial edema Hepatobiliary: gallbladder polyp, fatty liver, hepatitis Immune: anaphylactoid reactions including anaphylactic shock Infections and infestations: appendicitis Laboratory abnormalities: increased liver enzymes, CK increased, creatinine increased Metabolism and nutrition: diabetes mellitus Musculoskeletal: arthritis, joint effusion, Raynaud\u2019s syndrome Nervous system: convulsions, aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, hemiparesis, paresis, suicide attempt, paranoia, migraines, Bell\u2019s palsy, aphasia Renal and urinary: renal failure, renal insufficiency Reproductive and breast: gynecomastia, galactorrhea, libido decrease, breast carcinoma Respiratory: status asthmaticus, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary nodule, pneumothorax aggravated Skin and subcutaneous tissue: urticaria, cellulitis, petechiae Vascular: orthostatic hypotension, hematuria, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, arterial thrombosis of the arm"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The following drugs require monitoring and possible dose adjustment when used with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension: cyclosporine, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, beta-blockers, and bromocriptine ( 7 ) Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection: Discontinue octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at least 4 weeks prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of octreotide injection with cyclosporine may decrease blood levels of cyclosporine and result in transplant rejection. 7.2 Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Drugs Octreotide inhibits the secretion of insulin and glucagon. Therefore, blood glucose levels should be monitored when octreotide acetate for injectable suspension treatment is initiated and when the dose is altered and anti-diabetic treatment should be adjusted accordingly. 7.3 Bromocriptine Concomitant administration of octreotide and bromocriptine increases the availability of bromocriptine. 7.4 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy Concomitant administration of bradycardia-inducing drugs (e.g., beta-blockers) may have an additive effect on the reduction of heart rate associated with octreotide. Dose adjustments of concomitant medication may be necessary. Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. 7.5 Drug Metabolism Interactions Limited published data indicate that somatostatin analogs may decrease the metabolic clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which may be due to the suppression of growth hormone. Since it cannot be excluded that octreotide may have this effect, other drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and which have a low therapeutic index (e.g., quinidine, terfenadine) should therefore be used with caution. 7.6 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection Octreotide competitively binds to somatostatin receptors and may interfere with the efficacy of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Discontinue octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at least 4 weeks prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited data with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with intravenous administration of octreotide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 7- and 13-times, respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.5 mg/day based on body surface area (BSA). Transient growth retardation, with no impact on postnatal development, was observed in rat offspring from a pre- and post-natal study of octreotide at intravenous doses below the MRHD based on BSA (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received intravenous doses of octreotide up to 1 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. A slight reduction in body weight gain was noted in pregnant rats at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day. There were no maternal effects in rabbits or embryo-fetal effects in either species up to the maximum dose tested. At 1 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, the dose multiple was approximately 7- and 13-times, respectively, at the highest recommended human dose of 1.5 mg/day based on BSA. In a pre- and post-natal development rat study at intravenous doses of 0.02 to 1 mg/kg/day, a transient growth retardation of the offspring was observed at all doses which was possibly a consequence of growth hormone inhibition by octreotide. The doses attributed to the delayed growth are below the human dose of 1.5 mg/day, based on BSA. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies show that octreotide administered subcutaneously passes into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk (see Data) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from octreotide acetate for injectable suspension or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Following a subcutaneous dose (1 mg/kg) of octreotide to lactating rats, transfer of octreotide into milk was observed at a low concentration compared to plasma (milk/plasma ratio of 0.009). 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as the therapeutic benefits of a reduction in GH levels and normalization of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration in acromegalic females treated with octreotide may lead to improved fertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in the pediatric population have not been demonstrated. No formal controlled clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in pediatric patients under 6 years of age. In postmarketing reports, serious adverse events, including hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death, have been reported with octreotide acetate use in children, most notably in children under 2 years of age. The relationship of these events to octreotide acetate has not been established as the majority of these pediatric patients had serious underlying comorbid conditions. The efficacy and safety of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was examined in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-month pharmacokinetics study in 60 pediatric patients age 6 to 17 years with hypothalamic obesity resulting from cranial insult. The mean octreotide concentration after 6 doses of 40 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by IM injection every four weeks was approximately 3 ng/mL. Steady-state concentrations were achieved after 3 injections of a 40-mg dose. Mean BMI increased 0.1 kg/m 2 in octreotide acetate for injectable suspension-treated subjects compared to 0.0 kg/m 2 in saline control-treated subjects. Efficacy was not demonstrated. Diarrhea occurred in 11 of 30 (37%) patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. No unexpected adverse events were observed. However, with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adult indications, such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was dosed at 10 mg to 30 mg once a month. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of octreotide acetate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal failure requiring dialysis, the starting dose should be 10 mg. This dose should be up titrated based on clinical response and speed of response as deemed necessary by the physician. In patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment there is no need to adjust the starting dose of octreotide acetate. The maintenance dose should be adjusted thereafter based on clinical response and tolerability as in nonrenal patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment-Cirrhotic Patients In patients with established liver cirrhosis, the starting dose should be 10 mg. This dose should be up titrated based on clinical response and speed of response as deemed necessary by the physician. Once at a higher dose, patient should be maintained or dose adjusted based on response and tolerability as in any noncirrhotic patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension is a long-acting dosage form consisting of microspheres of the biodegradable glucose star polymer, D,L-lactic and glycolic acids copolymer, containing octreotide acetate. It maintains all of the clinical and pharmacological characteristics of the immediate-release dosage form octreotide acetate injection with the added feature of slow release of octreotide acetate from the site of injection, reducing the need for frequent administration. This slow release occurs as the polymer biodegrades, primarily through hydrolysis. Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension is designed to be injected intramuscularly (intragluteally) once every 4 weeks. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Octreotide exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin. It is an even more potent inhibitor of growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it also suppresses LH response to GnRH, decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide. By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and VIP secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Octreotide substantially reduces and in many cases can normalize growth hormone and/or IGF-1 (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly. Single doses of octreotide acetate injection given subcutaneously have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Octreotide may cause clinically significant suppression of TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Octreotide Acetate Injection According to data obtained with the immediate-release formulation, octreotide acetate injection solution, after subcutaneous injection, octreotide is absorbed rapidly and completely from the injection site. Peak concentrations of 5.2 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) were reached 0.4 hours after dosing. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, intravenous and subcutaneous doses were found to be bioequivalent. Peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) values were dose proportional both after subcutaneous or intravenous single doses up to 400 mcg and with multiple doses of 200 mcg 3 times daily (600 mcg/day). Clearance was reduced by about 66% suggesting nonlinear kinetics of the drug at daily doses of 600 mcg/day compared to 150 mcg/day. The relative decrease in clearance with doses above 600 mcg/day is not defined. In healthy volunteers, the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (t\u03b1 1/2 = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (Vdss) was estimated to be 13.6 L and the total body clearance was 10 L/h. In blood, the distribution of octreotide into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner. Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 hours, compared with the 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone, somatostatin. The duration of action of subcutaneously administered octreotide acetate injection solution is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor, necessitating multiple daily dosing with this immediate-release dosage form. About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine. In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug. In patients with acromegaly, the pharmacokinetics differ somewhat from those in healthy volunteers. A mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing. The Vdss was estimated to be 21.6 \u00b1 8.5 L and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h. The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%. The disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normals. The half-life in renal-impaired patients was slightly longer than normal subjects (2.4 to 3.1 h versus 1.9 h). The clearance in renal-impaired patients was 7.3 to 8.8 L/h as compared to 8.3 L/h in healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, clearance was reduced to about half that found in healthy subjects (from approximately 10 L/h to 4.5 L/h). Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide half-life increasing to 3.7 h and total body clearance decreasing to 5.9 L/h, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed half-life increasing to 3.4 h and total body clearance of 8.4 L/h. In normal subjects, octreotide half-life is 1.9 h and the clearance is 8.3 L/h which is comparable with the clearance in fatty-liver patients. Octreotide Acetate for Injectable Suspension The magnitude and duration of octreotide serum concentrations after an intramuscular injection of the long-acting depot formulation octreotide acetate for injectable suspension reflect the release of drug from the microsphere polymer matrix. Drug release is governed by the slow biodegradation of the microspheres in the muscle, but once present in the systemic circulation, octreotide distributes and is eliminated according to its known pharmacokinetic properties which are as follows. After a single IM injection of the long-acting depot dosage form octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in healthy volunteer subjects, the serum octreotide concentration reached a transient initial peak of about 0.03 ng/mL/mg within 1 hour after administration progressively declining over the following 3 to 5 days to a nadir of < 0.01 ng/mL/mg, then slowly increasing and reaching a plateau about 2 to 3 weeks post-injection. Plateau concentrations were maintained over a period of nearly 2 to 3 weeks, showing dose proportional peak concentrations of about 0.07 ng/mL/mg. After about 6 weeks post-injection, octreotide concentration slowly decreased, to < 0.01 ng/mL/mg by Weeks 12 to 13, concomitant with the terminal degradation phase of the polymer matrix of the dosage form. The relative bioavailability of the long-acting release octreotide acetate for injectable suspension compared to immediate-release octreotide acetate injection solution given subcutaneously was 60% to 63%. In patients with acromegaly, the octreotide concentrations after single doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension were dose proportional. The transient Day 1 peak, amounting to 0.3 ng/mL, 0.8 ng/mL, and 1.3 ng/mL, respectively, was followed by plateau concentrations of 0.5 ng/mL, 1.3 ng/mL, and 2.0 ng/mL, respectively, achieved about 3 weeks post-injection. These plateau concentrations were maintained for nearly 2 weeks. Following multiple doses of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension given every 4 weeks, steady-state octreotide serum concentrations were achieved after the third injection. Concentrations were dose proportional and higher by a factor of approximately 1.6 to 2.0 compared to the concentrations after a single dose. The steady-state octreotide concentrations were 1.2 ng/mL and 2.1 ng/mL, respectively, at trough and 1.6 ng/mL and 2.6 ng/mL, respectively, at peak with 20 mg and 30 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension given every 4 weeks. No accumulation of octreotide beyond that expected from the overlapping release profiles occurred over a duration of up to 28 monthly injections of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. With the long-acting depot formulation octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered IM every 4 weeks the peak-to-trough variation in octreotide concentrations ranged from 44% to 68%, compared to the 163% to 209% variation encountered with the daily subcutaneous three times daily regimen of octreotide acetate injection solution. In patients with carcinoid tumors, the mean octreotide concentrations after 6 doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by IM injection every 4 weeks were 1.2 ng/mL, 2.5 ng/mL, and 4.2 ng/mL, respectively. Concentrations were dose proportional and steady-state concentrations were reached after 2 injections of 20 mg and 30 mg and after 3 injections of 10 mg. Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment."

The transient Day 1 peak, amounting to 0.3 ng/mL, 0.8 ng/mL, and 1.3 ng/mL, respectively, was followed by plateau concentrations of 0.5 ng/mL, 1.3 ng/mL, and 2.0 ng/mL, respectively, achieved about 3 weeks post-injection. These plateau concentrations were maintained for nearly 2 weeks. Following multiple doses of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension given every 4 weeks, steady-state octreotide serum concentrations were achieved after the third injection. Concentrations were dose proportional and higher by a factor of approximately 1.6 to 2.0 compared to the concentrations after a single dose. The steady-state octreotide concentrations were 1.2 ng/mL and 2.1 ng/mL, respectively, at trough and 1.6 ng/mL and 2.6 ng/mL, respectively, at peak with 20 mg and 30 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension given every 4 weeks. No accumulation of octreotide beyond that expected from the overlapping release profiles occurred over a duration of up to 28 monthly injections of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. With the long-acting depot formulation octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered IM every 4 weeks the peak-to-trough variation in octreotide concentrations ranged from 44% to 68%, compared to the 163% to 209% variation encountered with the daily subcutaneous three times daily regimen of octreotide acetate injection solution. In patients with carcinoid tumors, the mean octreotide concentrations after 6 doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by IM injection every 4 weeks were 1.2 ng/mL, 2.5 ng/mL, and 4.2 ng/mL, respectively. Concentrations were dose proportional and steady-state concentrations were reached after 2 injections of 20 mg and 30 mg and after 3 injections of 10 mg. Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated no mutagenic potential of octreotide acetate. No mutagenic potential of the polymeric carrier in octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, D,L-lactic and glycolic acids copolymer, was observed in the Ames mutagenicity test. No carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in mice treated subcutaneously with octreotide for 85 to 99 weeks at doses up to 2 mg/kg/day (8-times the human exposure based on BSA). In a 116-week subcutaneous study in rats administered octreotide, a 27% and 12% incidence of injection-site sarcomas or squamous cell carcinomas was observed in males and females, respectively, at the highest dose level of 1.25 mg/kg/day (10-times the human exposure based on BSA) compared to an incidence of 8% to 10% in the vehicle-control groups. The increased incidence of injection-site tumors was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to repeated subcutaneous injections at the same site. Rotating injection sites would prevent chronic irritation in humans. There have been no reports of injection-site tumors in patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for at least 5 years. There was also a 15% incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas in the 1.25 mg/kg/day females compared to 7% in the saline-control females and 0% in the vehicle-control females. The presence of endometritis coupled with the absence of corpora lutea , the reduction in mammary fibroadenomas, and the presence of uterine dilatation suggest that the uterine tumors were associated with estrogen dominance in the aged female rats which does not occur in humans. Octreotide did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day, which represents 7-times the human exposure based on BSA."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acromegaly The clinical trials of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension were performed in patients who had been receiving octreotide acetate injection for a period of weeks to as long as 10 years. The acromegaly studies with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension described below were performed in patients who achieved GH levels of < 10 ng/mL (and, in most cases < 5 ng/mL) while on subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection. However, some patients enrolled were partial responders to subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection, i.e., GH levels were reduced by > 50% on subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection compared to the untreated state, although not suppressed to < 5 ng/mL. Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was evaluated in three clinical trials in acromegalic patients. In 2 of the clinical trials, a total of 101 patients were entered who had, in most cases, achieved a GH level < 5 ng/mL on octreotide acetate injection given in doses of 100 mcg or 200 mcg three times daily. Most patients were switched to 20 mg or 30 mg doses of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension given once every 4 weeks for up to 27 to 28 injections. A few patients received doses of 10 mg and a few required doses of 40 mg. Growth hormone and IGF-1 levels were at least as well controlled with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension as they had been on octreotide acetate injection and this level of control remained for the entire duration of the trials. A third trial was a 12-month study that enrolled 151 patients who had a GH level < 10 ng/mL after treatment with octreotide acetate injection (most had levels < 5 ng/mL). The starting dose of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was 20 mg every 4 weeks for 3 doses. Thereafter, patients received 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg every 4 weeks, depending upon the degree of GH suppression [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Growth hormone and IGF-1 were at least as well controlled on octreotide acetate for injectable suspension as they had been on octreotide acetate injection. Table 5 summarizes the data on hormonal control (GH and IGF-1) for those patients in the first two clinical trials who received all 27 to 28 injections of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension.

For the 88 patients in Table 5, a mean GH level of < 2.5 ng/mL was observed in 47% receiving octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Over the course of the trials, 42% of patients maintained mean growth hormone levels of < 2.5 ng/mL and mean normal IGF-1 levels. Table 6 summarizes the data on hormonal control (GH and IGF-1) for those patients in the third clinical trial who received all 12 injections of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Table 6.

For the 122 patients in Table 6, who received all 12 injections in the third trial, a mean GH level of < 2.5 ng/mL was observed in 66% receiving octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Over the course of the trial, 57% of patients maintained mean growth hormone levels of < 2.5 ng/mL and mean normal IGF-1 levels. In comparing the hormonal response in these trials, note that a higher percentage of patients in the third trial suppressed their mean GH to < 5 ng/mL on subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection, 95%, compared to 78% across the 2 previous trials. In all 3 trials, GH, IGF-1, and clinical symptoms were similarly controlled on octreotide acetate for injectable suspension as they had been on octreotide acetate injection. Of the 25 patients who completed the trials and were partial responders to octreotide acetate injection (GH > 5.0 ng/mL but reduced by > 50% relative to untreated levels), 1 patient (4%) responded to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension with a reduction of GH to < 2.5 ng/mL and 8 patients (32%) responded with a reduction of GH to < 5.0 ng/mL. Two open-label clinical studies investigated a 48-week treatment with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in 143 untreated ( de novo ) acromegalic patients. The median reduction in tumor volume was 20.6% in Study 1 (49 patients) at 24 weeks and 24.5% in Study 2 (94 patients) at 24 weeks and 36.2% at 48 weeks. 14.2 Carcinoid Syndrome A 6-month clinical trial of malignant carcinoid syndrome was performed in 93 patients who had previously been shown to be responsive to octreotide acetate injection. Sixty-seven (67) patients were randomized at baseline to receive double-blind doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension every 28 days and 26 patients continued, unblinded, on their previous octreotide acetate injection regimen (100 to 300 mcg three times daily). In any given month after steady-state levels of octreotide were reached, approximately 35% to 40% of the patients who received octreotide acetate for injectable suspension required supplemental subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection therapy usually for a few days, to control exacerbation of carcinoid symptoms. In any given month, the percentage of patients randomized to subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection, who required supplemental treatment with an increased dose of octreotide acetate injection, was similar to the percentage of patients randomized to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Over the 6-month treatment period, approximately 50% to 70% of patients who completed the trial on octreotide acetate for injectable suspension required subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection supplemental therapy to control exacerbation of carcinoid symptoms although steady-state serum octreotide acetate for injectable suspension levels had been reached. Table 7 presents the average number of daily stools and flushing episodes in malignant carcinoid patients. Table 7. Average Number of Daily Stools and Flushing Episodes in Patients with Malignant Carcinoid Syndrome Treatment Daily Stools Daily Flushing Episodes (Average Number) (Average Number) n Baseline Last Visit Baseline Last Visit Octreotide Acetate Injection S.C. 26 3.7 2.6 3.0 0.5 Octreotide Acetate for Injectable Suspension 10 mg 22 4.6 2.8 3.0 0.9 20 mg 20 4.0 2.1 5.9 0.6 30 mg 24 4.9 2.8 6.1 1.0 Overall, mean daily stool frequency was as well controlled on octreotide acetate for injectable suspension as on octreotide acetate injection (approximately 2 to 2.5 stools/day). Mean daily flushing episodes were similar at all doses of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension and on octreotide acetate injection (approximately 0.5 to 1 episode/day). In a subset of patients with variable severity of disease, median 24 hour urinary 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindole acetic acid) levels were reduced by 38% to 50% in the groups randomized to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. The reductions are within the range reported in the published literature for patients treated with octreotide (about 10% to 50%). Seventy-eight (78) patients with malignant carcinoid syndrome who had participated in this 6-month trial subsequently participated in a 12-month extension study in which they received 12 injections of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at 4-week intervals. For those who remained in the extension trial, diarrhea and flushing were as well controlled as during the 6-month trial. Because malignant carcinoid disease is progressive, as expected, a number of deaths (8 patients: 10%) occurred due to disease progression or complications from the underlying disease. An additional 22% of patients prematurely discontinued octreotide acetate for injectable suspension due to disease progression or worsening of carcinoid symptoms."

Remove the injection kit from the fridge and let the kit stand at room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes before reconstitution, but do not exceed 24 hours. After adding the diluent solution, ensure that the powder is fully saturated by letting the vial stand for a minimum of 2 minutes and up to 5 minutes. After saturation, shake the vial moderately in a horizontal direction for a minimum of 30 seconds, until uniform suspension is formed. Instructions for Gluteal Intramuscular (IM) Injection of Octreotide Acetate for Injectable Suspension Important Information for Health Care Professionals Successful preparation and administration of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension relies on proper suspension technique. Follow each of the steps outlined in this instruction booklet to ensure complete saturation of the powder and its uniform suspension prior to deep intragluteal injection. It is critical that octreotide acetate for injectable suspension and the diluent be allowed to reach room temperature and then be mixed immediately prior to injection. Ensure that the powder is completely suspended at the time of injection. If you have questions about preparation and/or administration of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, please call 1-888-838-2872. For more information on octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, see the full prescribing information. Package Contents Vial containing octreotide acetate for injectable suspension Vial adapter for drug product reconstitution Prefilled syringe containing diluent One 1 1/2\u201d 19-gauge safety needle Step 1 Remove the octreotide acetate for injectable suspension kit from refrigerated storage. ATTENTION: It is essential to start the reconstitution process only after the injection kit has reached room temperature. Let the kit stand at room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes before reconstitution, but do not exceed 24 hours. Note: The injection kit can be re-refrigerated if needed. Step 2 Remove the plastic cap from the vial and clean the rubber stopper of the vial with an alcohol wipe. Step 3 Peel the blister film and remove the vial adapter from its packaging by holding between the white luer cap and the skirt. DO NOT touch the tip of the access device at any time. Place the vial on a flat surface. Position the vial adapter on top of the vial and push it fully down so that it snaps in place, confirmed by an audible \u201cclick\u201d. CLEAN the tip of the vial adapter with an alcohol wipe Step 4 Peel off outer syringe label. Inspect syringe to ensure there are no visible particles. Step 5 Snap off the smooth white cap from the syringe prefilled with diluent solution and screw the syringe onto the vial adapter. Slowly push the plunger all the way down to transfer all the diluent solution in the vial. Step 6 ATTENTION: It is essential to let the vial stand for a minimum of 2 minutes and up to 5 minutes to ensure that the diluent has fully saturated the powder. Note: It is normal if the plunger rod moves up as there might be a slight overpressure in the vial. At this stage prepare the patient for injection. Step 7 After the saturation period, make sure that the plunger is pushed all the way down in the syringe. ATTENTION: Keep the plunger pressed and shake the vial moderately in a horizontal direction for a minimum of 30 seconds so that the powder is completely suspended (uniform milky suspension). Repeat moderate shaking for another 30 seconds if the powder is not completely suspended. Step 8 Turn syringe and vial upside down, slowly pull the plunger back and draw the entire contents from the vial into the syringe. Unscrew the syringe from the vial adapter. Step 9 Prepare the injection site with an alcohol wipe. Screw the safety injection needle onto the syringe. Gently re-shake the syringe to a milky uniform suspension. Pull the protective cover straight off the needle. Gently tap the syringe to remove any visible bubbles and expel them from the syringe. Proceed immediately to Step 10 for admininstration to the patient. Any delay may result in sedimentation. Step 10 Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension must be given only by deep intragluteal injection, NEVER intravenously. Insert the needle fully into the left or right gluteus at a 90\u00ba angle to the skin. Slowly pull back the plunger to check that no blood vessel has been penetrated (reposition if a blood vessel has been penetrated). Depress the plunger with steady pressure until the syringe is empty. Withdraw the needle from the injection site and activate the safety guard (as shown in Step 11 ). Step 11 Activate the safety guard over the needle in one of the 2 methods shown: either press the hinged section of the safety guard down onto a hard surface (figure A) or push the hinge forward with your finger (figure B). An audible \u201cclick\u201d confirms the proper activation. Note: Record injection site on patient\u2019s record and alternate monthly. Step 12 Dispose of syringe immediately (in a sharps container). Special precautions for disposal Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

For patients with a greater skin to muscle depth, a size 2\u201d 19 gauge needle (not supplied) may be used. \u2022 Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension should be administered intramuscularly (IM) in the gluteal region at 4-week intervals. Administration of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at intervals greater than 4 weeks is not recommended. \u2022 Injection sites should be rotated in a systematic manner to avoid irritation. Deltoid injections should be avoided due to significant discomfort at the injection site when given in that area. \u2022 Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension should never be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. The following dosage regimens are recommended. Patients Not Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Injection Subcutaneously: \u2022 Acromegaly: 50 mcg three times daily octreotide acetate injection subcutaneously for 2 weeks followed by octreotide acetate for injectable suspension 20 mg intragluteally every 4 weeks for 3 months ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Carcinoid Tumors and VIPomas: Octreotide acetate injection subcutaneously 100 mcg/day to 600 mcg/day in 2 to 4 divided doses for 2 weeks followed by octreotide acetate for injectable suspension 20 mg every 4 weeks for 2 months ( 2.2 ) Patients Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Injection Subcutaneously: \u2022 Acromegaly: 20 mg every 4 weeks for 3 months ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Carcinoid Tumors and VIPomas: 20 mg every 4 weeks for 2 months ( 2.2 ) Renal Impairment, Patients on Dialysis: 10 mg every 4 weeks ( 2.3 ) Hepatic Impairment, Patients With Cirrhosis: 10 mg every 4 weeks ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Acromegaly Patients Not Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Patients not currently receiving octreotide acetate should begin therapy with octreotide acetate injection given subcutaneously in an initial dose of 50 mcg three times daily which may be titrated. Most patients require doses of 100 mcg to 200 mcg three times daily for maximum effect but some patients require up to 500 mcg three times daily. Patients should be maintained on octreotide acetate injection subcutaneous for at least 2 weeks to determine tolerance to octreotide acetate. Patients who are considered to be \u201cresponders\u201d to the drug, based on GH and IGF-1 levels and who tolerate the drug, can then be switched to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in the dosage scheme described below (Patients Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Injection). Patients Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Injection Patients currently receiving octreotide acetate injection can be switched directly to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in a dose of 20 mg given IM intragluteally at 4-week intervals for 3 months. After 3 months, dosage may be adjusted as follows: \u2022 GH \u2264 2.5 ng/mL, IGF-1 normal, and clinical symptoms controlled: maintain octreotide acetate for injectable suspension dosage at 20 mg every 4 weeks \u2022 GH > 2.5 ng/mL, IGF-1 elevated, and/or clinical symptoms uncontrolled, increase octreotide acetate for injectable suspension dosage to 30 mg every 4 weeks \u2022 GH \u2264 1 ng/mL, IGF-1 normal, and clinical symptoms controlled, reduce octreotide acetate for injectable suspension dosage to 10 mg every 4 weeks \u2022 If GH, IGF-1, or symptoms are not adequately controlled at a dose of 30 mg, the dose may be increased to 40 mg every 4 weeks. Doses higher than 40 mg are not recommended. In patients who have received pituitary irradiation, octreotide acetate for injectable suspension should be withdrawn yearly for approximately 8 weeks to assess disease activity. If GH or IGF-1 levels increase and signs and symptoms recur, octreotide acetate for injectable suspension therapy may be resumed. 2.2 Carcinoid Tumors and VIPomas Patients Not Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Patients not currently receiving octreotide acetate should begin therapy with octreotide acetate injection given subcutaneously. The suggested daily dosage for carcinoid tumors during the first 2 weeks of therapy ranges from 100 mcg/day to 600 mcg/day in 2 to 4 divided doses (mean daily dosage is 300 mcg). Some patients may require doses up to 1,500 mcg/day. The suggested daily dosage for VIPomas is 200 mcg to 300 mcg in 2 to 4 divided doses (range, 150 mcg to 750 mcg); dosage may be adjusted on an individual basis to control symptoms but usually doses above 450 mcg/day are not required. Octreotide acetate injection should be continued for at least 2 weeks. Thereafter, patients who are considered \u201cresponders\u201d to octreotide acetate, and who tolerate the drug, may be switched to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in the dosage regimen as described below (Patients Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Injection). Patients Currently Receiving Octreotide Acetate Injection Patients currently receiving octreotide acetate injection can be switched to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in a dosage of 20 mg given IM intragluteally at 4-week intervals for 2 months. Because of the need for serum octreotide to reach therapeutically effective levels following initial injection of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, carcinoid tumor and VIPoma patients should continue to receive octreotide acetate injection subcutaneously for at least 2 weeks in the same dosage they were taking before the switch. Failure to continue subcutaneous injections for this period may result in exacerbation of symptoms (some patients may require 3 or 4 weeks of such therapy). After 2 months, dosage may be adjusted as follows: \u2022 If symptoms are adequately controlled, consider a dose reduction to 10 mg for a trial period. If symptoms recur, dosage should then be increased to 20 mg every 4 weeks. Many patients can, however, be satisfactorily maintained at a 10 mg dose every 4 weeks. \u2022 If symptoms are not adequately controlled, increase octreotide acetate for injectable suspension to 30 mg every 4 weeks. Patients who achieve good control on a 20 mg dose may have their dose lowered to 10 mg for a trial period. If symptoms recur, dosage should then be increased to 20 mg every 4 weeks. \u2022 Dosages higher than 30 mg are not recommended. Despite good overall control of symptoms, patients with carcinoid tumors and VIPomas often experience periodic exacerbation of symptoms (regardless of whether they are being maintained on octreotide acetate injection or octreotide acetate for injectable suspension). During these periods, they may be given octreotide acetate injection subcutaneously for a few days at the dosage they were receiving prior to switching to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. When symptoms are again controlled, the octreotide acetate injection subcutaneous can be discontinued. 2.3 Special Populations: Renal Impairment In patients with renal failure requiring dialysis, the starting dose should be 10 mg every 4 weeks. In other patients with renal impairment, the starting dose should be similar to a nonrenal patient (i.e., 20 mg every 4 weeks) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ] . 2.4 Special Populations: Hepatic Impairment \u2013 Cirrhotic Patients In patients with established cirrhosis of the liver, the starting dose should be 10 mg every 4 weeks [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis: Monitor periodically. Discontinue if complications of cholelithiasis are suspected ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Glucose Metabolism: Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia may occur. Glucose monitoring is recommended and anti-diabetic treatment may need adjustment ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Thyroid Function: Hypothyroidism may occur. Monitor thyroid levels periodically ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Cardiac Function: Bradycardia, arrhythmia, or conduction abnormalities may occur. Use with caution in at-risk patients ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats: New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss may occur. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported, evaluate for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension may inhibit gallbladder contractility and decrease bile secretion, which may lead to gallbladder abnormalities or sludge. There have been postmarketing reports of cholelithiasis (gallstones) resulting in complications, including cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis and requiring cholecystectomy in patients taking octreotide acetate for injectable suspension [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Patients should be monitored periodically. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue octreotide acetate for injectable suspension and treat appropriately. 5.2 Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia Octreotide alters the balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone (GH), which may result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Blood glucose levels should be monitored when octreotide acetate for injectable suspension treatment is initiated, or when the dose is altered. Anti-diabetic treatment should be adjusted accordingly [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.3 Thyroid Function Abnormalities Octreotide suppresses the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which may result in hypothyroidism. Baseline and periodic assessment of thyroid function (TSH, total and/or free T 4 ) is recommended during chronic octreotide therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.4 Cardiac Function Abnormalities In both acromegalic and carcinoid syndrome patients, bradycardia, arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities have been reported during octreotide therapy. Other electrocardiogram (ECG) changes were observed such as QT prolongation, axis shifts, early repolarization, low voltage, R/S transition, early R wave progression, and nonspecific ST-T wave changes. The relationship of these events to octreotide acetate is not established because many of these patients have underlying cardiac disease. Dose adjustments in drugs such as beta-blockers that have bradycardic effects may be necessary. In one acromegalic patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), initiation of octreotide acetate injection-therapy resulted in worsening of CHF with improvement when drug was discontinued. Confirmation of a drug effect was obtained with a positive rechallenge [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.5 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration and loose stool have been reported in patients receiving somatostatin analogs, including octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Somatostatin analogs reversibly inhibit secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile acids, which may result in malabsorption of dietary fats and subsequent symptoms of steatorrhea, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported in patients receiving octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, evaluate patients for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and manage accordingly . 5.6 Changes in Vitamin B12 Levels Depressed vitamin B12 levels and abnormal Schilling tests have been observed in some patients receiving octreotide therapy, and monitoring of vitamin B12 levels is recommended during therapy with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. 5.7 Changes in Zinc Levels Octreotide has been investigated for the reduction of excessive fluid loss from the GI tract in patients with conditions producing such a loss. If such patients are receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), serum zinc may rise excessively when the fluid loss is reversed. Patients on TPN and octreotide should have periodic monitoring of zinc levels. 5.8 Monitoring: Laboratory Tests Laboratory tests that may be helpful as biochemical markers in determining and following patient response depend on the specific tumor. Based on diagnosis, measurement of the following substances may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) ] . Acromegaly: Growth Hormone, IGF-1 (somatomedin C) Carcinoid: 5-HIAA (urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid), plasma serotonin, plasma Substance P VIPoma: VIP (plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide) baseline and periodic total and/or free T 4 measurements should be performed during chronic therapy 5.9 Drug Interactions Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. Concomitant administration of octreotide injection with cyclosporine may decrease blood levels of cyclosporine [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Thyroid Function Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Cardiac Function Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Changes in Vitamin B12 Levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Changes in Zinc Levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Monitoring: Laboratory Tests [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 Drug Interactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] The most common adverse reactions, occurring in \u2265 20% of patients are: \u2022 Acromegaly: diarrhea, cholelithiasis, abdominal pain, flatulence ( 6.1 ) \u2022 Carcinoid Syndrome: back pain, fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Acromegaly The safety of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in the treatment of acromegaly has been evaluated in three Phase 3 studies in 261 patients, including 209 exposed for 48 weeks and 96 exposed for greater than 108 weeks. Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was studied primarily in a double-blind, cross-over manner. Patients on subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection were switched to the LAR formulation followed by an open-label extension. The population age range was 14 to 81 years old and 53% were female. Approximately 35% of these acromegaly patients had not been treated with surgery and/or radiation. Most patients received a starting dose of 20 mg every 4 weeks intramuscularly. Dose was up or down titrated based on efficacy and tolerability to a final dose between 10 mg to 60 mg every 4 weeks. Table 1 below reflects adverse events from these studies regardless of presumed causality to study drug. Table 1. Adverse Events Occurring in \u2265 10% of Acromegalic Patients in the Phase 3 Studies Abbreviation: AEs, adverse events. WHO Preferred Term Phase 3 Studies (Pooled) Number (%) of Subjects with AEs 10 mg/20 mg/30 mg (n = 261) n (%) Diarrhea 93 (35.6) Abdominal Pain 75 (28.7) Flatulence 66 (25.3) Influenza-Like Symptoms 52 (19.9) Constipation 46 (17.6) Headache 40 (15.3) Anemia 40 (15.3) Injection-Site Pain 36 (13.8) Cholelithiasis 35 (13.4) Hypertension 33 (12.6) Dizziness 30 (11.5) Fatigue 29 (11.1) The safety of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in the treatment of acromegaly was also evaluated in a postmarketing randomized Phase 4 study. One-hundred four (104) patients were randomized to either pituitary surgery or 20 mg of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. All the patients were treatment na\u00efve ( \u2018de novo\u2019 ). Crossover was allowed according to treatment response and a total of 76 patients were exposed to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Approximately half of the patients initially randomized to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension were exposed to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension up to 1 year. The population age range was between 20 to 76 years old, 45% were female, 93% were Caucasian, and 1% Black. The majority of these patients were exposed to 30 mg every 4 weeks. Table 2 below reflects the adverse events occurring in this study regardless of presumed causality to study drug. Table 2. Adverse Events Occurring in \u2265 10% of Acromegalic Patients in Phase 4 Study WHO Preferred Term Phase 4 Study Octreotide Acetate for Injectable Suspension N = 76 n (%) Phase 4 Study Surgery N = 64 n (%) Diarrhea 36 (47.4) 2 (3.1) Cholelithiasis 29 (38.2) 3 (4.7) Abdominal Pain 19 (25.0) 2 (3.1) Nausea 12 (15.8) 5 (7.8) Alopecia 10 (13.2) 5 (7.8) Injection-Site Pain 9 (11.8) 0 Abdominal Pain Upper 8 (10.5) 0 Headache 8 (10.5) 6 (9.4) Epistaxis 0 7 (10.9) Gallbladder Abnormalities Single doses of octreotide acetate injection have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In clinical trials with octreotide acetate injection (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis) in patients who had not previously received octreotide acetate, the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. The incidence of gallbladder abnormalities did not appear to be related to age, sex, or dose but was related to duration of exposure. In clinical trials, 52% of acromegalic patients, most of whom received octreotide acetate for injectable suspension for 12 months or longer, developed new biliary abnormalities including gallstones, microlithiasis, sediment, sludge, and dilatation. The incidence of new cholelithiasis was 22%, of which 7% were microstones. Across all trials, a few patients developed acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, biliary obstruction, cholestatic hepatitis, or pancreatitis during octreotide therapy or following its withdrawal. One patient developed ascending cholangitis during octreotide acetate injection therapy and died. Despite the high incidence of new gallstones in patients receiving octreotide acetate, 1% of patients developed acute symptoms requiring cholecystectomy. Glucose Metabolism - Hypoglycemia/Hyperglycemia In acromegaly patients treated with either octreotide acetate injection or octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, hypoglycemia occurred in approximately 2% and hyperglycemia in approximately 15% of patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Hypothyroidism In acromegaly patients receiving octreotide acetate injection, 12% developed biochemical hypothyroidism, 8% developed goiter, and 4% required initiation of thyroid replacement therapy while receiving octreotide acetate injection. In acromegalic patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse event in 2% and goiter in 2%. Two patients receiving octreotide acetate for injectable suspension required initiation of thyroid hormone replacement therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Cardiac In acromegalic patients, sinus bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias developed in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection-therapy. The relationship of these events to octreotide acetate is not established because many of these patients have underlying cardiac disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Gastrointestinal The most common symptoms are gastrointestinal. The overall incidence of the most frequent of these symptoms in clinical trials of acromegalic patients treated for approximately 1 to 4 years is shown in Table 3. Table 3. Number (%) of Acromegalic Patients With Common GI Adverse Events Adverse Event Octreotide Acetate Injection S.C. Three Times Daily n = 114 Octreotide Acetate for Injectable Suspension Every 28 Days n = 261 n % n % Diarrhea 66 (57.9) 95 (36.4) Abdominal Pain or Discomfort 50 (43.9) 76 (29.1) Nausea 34 (29.8) 27 (10.3) Flatulence 15 (13.2) 67 (25.7) Constipation 10 (8.8) 49 (18.8) Vomiting 5 (4.4) 17 (6.5) Only 2.6% of the patients on octreotide acetate injection in US clinical trials discontinued therapy due to these symptoms. No acromegalic patient receiving octreotide acetate for injectable suspension discontinued therapy for a GI event. In patients receiving octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, the incidence of diarrhea was dose related. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea developed primarily during the first month of treatment with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Thereafter, new cases of these events were uncommon. The vast majority of these events were mild-to-moderate in severity. In rare instances, gastrointestinal adverse effects may resemble acute intestinal obstruction, with progressive abdominal distention, severe epigastric pain, abdominal tenderness, and guarding. Dyspepsia, steatorrhea, discoloration of feces, and tenesmus were reported in 4% to 6% of patients. In a clinical trial of carcinoid syndrome, nausea, abdominal pain, and flatulence were reported in 27% to 38% and constipation or vomiting in 15% to 21% of patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Diarrhea was reported as an adverse event in 14% of patients, but since most of the patients had diarrhea as a symptom of carcinoid syndrome, it is difficult to assess the actual incidence of drug-related diarrhea. Pain at the Injection Site Pain on injection, which is generally mild-to-moderate, and short-lived (usually about 1 hour) is dose related, being reported by 2%, 9%, and 11% of acromegalic patients receiving doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg, respectively, of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. In carcinoid patients, where a diary was kept, pain at the injection site was reported by about 20% to 25% at a 10 mg dose and about 30% to 50% at the 20 mg and 30 mg dose. Antibodies to Octreotide Studies to date have shown that antibodies to octreotide develop in up to 25% of patients treated with octreotide acetate. These antibodies do not influence the degree of efficacy response to octreotide; however, in two acromegalic patients who received octreotide acetate injection, the duration of GH suppression following each injection was about twice as long as in patients without antibodies. It has not been determined whether octreotide antibodies will also prolong the duration of GH suppression in patients being treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Carcinoid and VIPomas The safety of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in the treatment of carcinoid tumors and VIPomas has been evaluated in one Phase 3 study. Study 1 randomized 93 patients with carcinoid syndrome to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg in a blind fashion or to open-label octreotide acetate injection subcutaneously. The population age range was between 25 to 78 years old and 44% were female, 95% were Caucasian and 3% Black. All the patients had symptom control on their previous octreotide acetate injection subcutaneous treatment. Eighty (80) patients finished the initial 24 weeks of octreotide acetate injection exposure in Study 1. In Study 1, comparable numbers of patients were randomized to each dose. Table 4 below reflects the adverse events occurring in \u2265 15% of patients regardless of presumed causality to study drug. Table 4.

New gallstones occurred in a total of 24% of patients. Glucose Metabolism - Hypoglycemia/Hyperglycemia In carcinoid patients, hypoglycemia occurred in 4% and hyperglycemia in 27% of patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Hypothyroidism In carcinoid patients, hypothyroidism has only been reported in isolated patients and goiter has not been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Cardiac Electrocardiograms were performed only in carcinoid patients receiving octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. In carcinoid syndrome patients, sinus bradycardia developed in 19%, conduction abnormalities occurred in 9%, and arrhythmias developed in 3%. The relationship of these events to octreotide acetate is not established because many of these patients have underlying cardiac disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other Clinical Studies Adverse Events Other clinically significant adverse events (relationship to drug not established) in acromegalic and/or carcinoid syndrome patients receiving octreotide acetate for injectable suspension were malignant hyperpyrexia, cerebral vascular disorder, rectal bleeding, ascites, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and pleural effusion. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during the postapproval use of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic: pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia Cardiac: myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation Ear and labyrinth: deafness Endocrine: diabetes insipidus, adrenal insufficiency in patients 18 months of age and under, pituitary apoplexy Eye: glaucoma, visual field defect, scotoma, retinal vein thrombosis Gastrointestinal: intestinal obstruction, peptic/gastric ulcer, abdomen enlarged, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency General and administration site: generalized edema, facial edema Hepatobiliary: gallbladder polyp, fatty liver, hepatitis Immune: anaphylactoid reactions including anaphylactic shock Infections and infestations: appendicitis Laboratory abnormalities: increased liver enzymes, CK increased, creatinine increased Metabolism and nutrition: diabetes mellitus Musculoskeletal: arthritis, joint effusion, Raynaud\u2019s syndrome Nervous system: convulsions, aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, hemiparesis, paresis, suicide attempt, paranoia, migraines, Bell\u2019s palsy, aphasia Renal and urinary: renal failure, renal insufficiency Reproductive and breast: gynecomastia, galactorrhea, libido decrease, breast carcinoma Respiratory: status asthmaticus, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary nodule, pneumothorax aggravated Skin and subcutaneous tissue: urticaria, cellulitis, petechiae Vascular: orthostatic hypotension, hematuria, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, arterial thrombosis of the arm"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 The following drugs require monitoring and possible dose adjustment when used with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension: cyclosporine, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, beta-blockers, and bromocriptine ( 7 ) \u2022 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection: Discontinue octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at least 4 weeks prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Cyclosporine Concomitant administration of octreotide injection with cyclosporine may decrease blood levels of cyclosporine and result in transplant rejection. 7.2 Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Drugs Octreotide inhibits the secretion of insulin and glucagon. Therefore, blood glucose levels should be monitored when octreotide acetate for injectable suspension treatment is initiated and when the dose is altered and anti-diabetic treatment should be adjusted accordingly. 7.3 Bromocriptine Concomitant administration of octreotide and bromocriptine increases the availability of bromocriptine. 7.4 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy Concomitant administration of bradycardia-inducing drugs (e.g., beta-blockers) may have an additive effect on the reduction of heart rate associated with octreotide. Dose adjustments of concomitant medication may be necessary. Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. 7.5 Drug Metabolism Interactions Limited published data indicate that somatostatin analogs may decrease the metabolic clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which may be due to the suppression of growth hormone. Since it cannot be excluded that octreotide may have this effect, other drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and which have a low therapeutic index (e.g., quinidine, terfenadine) should therefore be used with caution. 7.6 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection Octreotide competitively binds to somatostatin receptors and may interfere with the efficacy of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Discontinue octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at least 4 weeks prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited data with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with intravenous administration of octreotide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 7- and 13-times, respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.5 mg/day based on body surface area (BSA). Transient growth retardation, with no impact on postnatal development, was observed in rat offspring from a pre- and post-natal study of octreotide at intravenous doses below the MRHD based on BSA (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received intravenous doses of octreotide up to 1 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. A slight reduction in body weight gain was noted in pregnant rats at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day. There were no maternal effects in rabbits or embryo-fetal effects in either species up to the maximum dose tested. At 1 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, the dose multiple was approximately 7- and 13-times, respectively, at the highest recommended human dose of 1.5 mg/day based on BSA. In a pre- and post-natal development rat study at intravenous doses of 0.02 to 1 mg/kg/day, a transient growth retardation of the offspring was observed at all doses which was possibly a consequence of growth hormone inhibition by octreotide. The doses attributed to the delayed growth are below the human dose of 1.5 mg/day, based on BSA. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies show that octreotide administered subcutaneously passes into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk (see Data ) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from octreotide acetate for injectable suspension or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Following a subcutaneous dose (1 mg/kg) of octreotide to lactating rats, transfer of octreotide into milk was observed at a low concentration compared to plasma (milk/plasma ratio of 0.009). 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as the therapeutic benefits of a reduction in GH levels and normalization of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration in acromegalic females treated with octreotide may lead to improved fertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in the pediatric population have not been demonstrated. No formal controlled clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in pediatric patients under 6 years of age. In postmarketing reports, serious adverse events, including hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death, have been reported with octreotide acetate injection use in children, most notably in children under 2 years of age. The relationship of these events to octreotide acetate has not been established as the majority of these pediatric patients had serious underlying comorbid conditions. The efficacy and safety of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was examined in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-month pharmacokinetics study in 60 pediatric patients age 6 to 17 years with hypothalamic obesity resulting from cranial insult. The mean octreotide concentration after 6 doses of 40 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by IM injection every four weeks was approximately 3 ng/mL. Steady-state concentrations were achieved after 3 injections of a 40 mg dose. Mean BMI increased 0.1 kg/m 2 in octreotide acetate for injectable suspension-treated subjects compared to 0.0 kg/m 2 in saline control-treated subjects. Efficacy was not demonstrated. Diarrhea occurred in 11 of 30 (37%) patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. No unexpected adverse events were observed. However, with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adult indications, such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was dosed at 10 mg to 30 mg once a month. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of octreotide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal failure requiring dialysis, the starting dose should be 10 mg. This dose should be up titrated based on clinical response and speed of response as deemed necessary by the physician. In patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment there is no need to adjust the starting dose of octreotide acetate injection. The maintenance dose should be adjusted thereafter based on clinical response and tolerability as in nonrenal patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment-Cirrhotic Patients In patients with established liver cirrhosis, the starting dose should be 10 mg. This dose should be up titrated based on clinical response and speed of response as deemed necessary by the physician. Once at a higher dose, patient should be maintained or dose adjusted based on response and tolerability as in any noncirrhotic patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ] ."

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received intravenous doses of octreotide up to 1 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. A slight reduction in body weight gain was noted in pregnant rats at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day. There were no maternal effects in rabbits or embryo-fetal effects in either species up to the maximum dose tested. At 1 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, the dose multiple was approximately 7- and 13-times, respectively, at the highest recommended human dose of 1.5 mg/day based on BSA. In a pre- and post-natal development rat study at intravenous doses of 0.02 to 1 mg/kg/day, a transient growth retardation of the offspring was observed at all doses which was possibly a consequence of growth hormone inhibition by octreotide. The doses attributed to the delayed growth are below the human dose of 1.5 mg/day, based on BSA."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension is a long-acting dosage form consisting of microspheres of the biodegradable glucose star polymer, D,L-lactic and glycolic acids copolymer, containing octreotide acetate. It maintains all of the clinical and pharmacological characteristics of the immediate-release dosage form octreotide acetate injection with the added feature of slow release of octreotide acetate from the site of injection, reducing the need for frequent administration. This slow release occurs as the polymer biodegrades, primarily through hydrolysis. Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension is designed to be injected intramuscularly (intragluteally) once every 4 weeks. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Octreotide exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin. It is an even more potent inhibitor of growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it also suppresses LH response to GnRH, decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide. By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and VIP secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Octreotide substantially reduces and in many cases can normalize growth hormone and/or IGF-1 (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly. Single doses of octreotide acetate injection given subcutaneously have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Octreotide may cause clinically significant suppression of TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Octreotide Acetate Injection According to data obtained with the immediate-release formulation, octreotide acetate injection solution, after subcutaneous injection, octreotide is absorbed rapidly and completely from the injection site. Peak concentrations of 5.2 ng/mL (100 mcg dose) were reached 0.4 hours after dosing. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, intravenous and subcutaneous doses were found to be bioequivalent. Peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) values were dose proportional both after subcutaneous or intravenous single doses up to 400 mcg and with multiple doses of 200 mcg 3 times daily (600 mcg/day). Clearance was reduced by about 66% suggesting nonlinear kinetics of the drug at daily doses of 600 mcg/day compared to 150 mcg/day. The relative decrease in clearance with doses above 600 mcg/day is not defined. In healthy volunteers, the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (t \u03b11/2 = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (Vdss) was estimated to be 13.6 L and the total body clearance was 10 L/h. In blood, the distribution of octreotide into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner. Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 hours, compared with the 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone, somatostatin. The duration of action of subcutaneously administered octreotide acetate injection solution is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor, necessitating multiple daily dosing with this immediate-release dosage form. About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine. In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug. In patients with acromegaly, the pharmacokinetics differ somewhat from those in healthy volunteers. A mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100 mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing. The Vdss was estimated to be 21.6 \u00b1 8.5 L and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h. The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%. The disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normals. The half-life in renal-impaired patients was slightly longer than normal subjects (2.4 to 3.1 h versus 1.9 h). The clearance in renal-impaired patients was 7.3 to 8.8 L/h as compared to 8.3 L/h in healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, clearance was reduced to about half that found in healthy subjects (from approximately 10 L/h to 4.5 L/h). Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide half-life increasing to 3.7 h and total body clearance decreasing to 5.9 L/h, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed half-life increasing to 3.4 h and total body clearance of 8.4 L/h. In normal subjects, octreotide half-life is 1.9 h and the clearance is 8.3 L/h which is comparable with the clearance in fatty-liver patients. OCTREOTIDE ACETATE FOR INJECTABLE SUSPENSION The magnitude and duration of octreotide serum concentrations after an intramuscular injection of the long-acting depot formulation octreotide acetate for injectable suspension reflect the release of drug from the microsphere polymer matrix. Drug release is governed by the slow biodegradation of the microspheres in the muscle, but once present in the systemic circulation, octreotide distributes and is eliminated according to its known pharmacokinetic properties which are as follows. After a single IM injection of the long-acting depot dosage form octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in healthy volunteer subjects, the serum octreotide concentration reached a transient initial peak of about 0.03 ng/mL/mg within 1 hour after administration progressively declining over the following 3 to 5 days to a nadir of < 0.01 ng/mL/mg, then slowly increasing and reaching a plateau about 2 to 3 weeks postinjection. Plateau concentrations were maintained over a period of nearly 2 to 3 weeks, showing dose proportional peak concentrations of about 0.07 ng/mL/mg. After about 6 weeks postinjection, octreotide concentration slowly decreased, to < 0.01 ng/mL/mg by Weeks 12 to 13, concomitant with the terminal degradation phase of the polymer matrix of the dosage form. The relative bioavailability of the long-acting release octreotide acetate for injectable suspension compared to immediate-release octreotide acetate injection solution given subcutaneously was 60% to 63%. In patients with acromegaly, the octreotide concentrations after single doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension were dose proportional. The transient Day 1 peak, amounting to 0.3 ng/mL, 0.8 ng/mL, and 1.3 ng/mL, respectively, was followed by plateau concentrations of 0.5 ng/mL, 1.3 ng/mL, and 2.0 ng/mL, respectively, achieved about 3 weeks postinjection. These plateau concentrations were maintained for nearly 2 weeks. Following multiple doses of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension given every 4 weeks, steady-state octreotide serum concentrations were achieved after the third injection. Concentrations were dose proportional and higher by a factor of approximately 1.6 to 2.0 compared to the concentrations after a single dose. The steady-state octreotide concentrations were 1.2 ng/mL and 2.1 ng/mL, respectively, at trough and 1.6 ng/mL and 2.6 ng/mL, respectively, at peak with 20 mg and 30 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension given every 4 weeks. No accumulation of octreotide beyond that expected from the overlapping release profiles occurred over a duration of up to 28 monthly injections of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. With the long-acting depot formulation octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered IM every 4 weeks the peak-to-trough variation in octreotide concentrations ranged from 44% to 68%, compared to the 163% to 209% variation encountered with the daily subcutaneous three times daily regimen of octreotide acetate injection solution. In patients with carcinoid tumors, the mean octreotide concentrations after 6 doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by IM injection every 4 weeks were 1.2 ng/mL, 2.5 ng/mL, and 4.2 ng/mL, respectively. Concentrations were dose proportional and steady-state concentrations were reached after 2 injections of 20 mg and 30 mg and after 3 injections of 10 mg.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated no mutagenic potential of octreotide acetate injection. No mutagenic potential of the polymeric carrier in octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, D,L-lactic and glycolic acids copolymer, was observed in the Ames mutagenicity test. No carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in mice treated subcutaneously with octreotide for 85 to 99 weeks at doses up to 2 mg/kg/day (8-times the human exposure based on BSA). In a 116-week subcutaneous study in rats administered octreotide, a 27% and 12% incidence of injection-site sarcomas or squamous cell carcinomas was observed in males and females, respectively, at the highest dose level of 1.25 mg/kg/day (10-times the human exposure based on BSA) compared to an incidence of 8% to 10% in the vehicle-control groups. The increased incidence of injection-site tumors was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to repeated subcutaneous injections at the same site. Rotating injection sites would prevent chronic irritation in humans. There have been no reports of injection-site tumors in patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for at least 5 years. There was also a 15% incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas in the 1.25 mg/kg/day females compared to 7% in the saline-control females and 0% in the vehicle-control females. The presence of endometritis coupled with the absence of corpora lutea , the reduction in mammary fibroadenomas, and the presence of uterine dilatation suggest that the uterine tumors were associated with estrogen dominance in the aged female rats which does not occur in humans. Octreotide did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day, which represents 7-times the human exposure based on BSA."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acromegaly The clinical trials of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension were performed in patients who had been receiving octreotide acetate injection for a period of weeks to as long as 10 years. The acromegaly studies with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension described below were performed in patients who achieved GH levels of < 10 ng/mL (and, in most cases < 5 ng/mL) while on subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection. However, some patients enrolled were partial responders to subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection, i.e., GH levels were reduced by > 50% on subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection compared to the untreated state, although not suppressed to < 5 ng/mL. Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was evaluated in three clinical trials in acromegalic patients. In 2 of the clinical trials, a total of 101 patients were entered who had, in most cases, achieved a GH level < 5 ng/mL on octreotide acetate injection given in doses of 100 mcg or 200 mcg three times daily. Most patients were switched to 20 mg or 30 mg doses of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension given once every 4 weeks for up to 27 to 28 injections. A few patients received doses of 10 mg and a few required doses of 40 mg. Growth hormone and IGF-1 levels were at least as well controlled with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension as they had been on octreotide acetate injection and this level of control remained for the entire duration of the trials. A third trial was a 12-month study that enrolled 151 patients who had a GH level < 10 ng/mL after treatment with octreotide acetate injection (most had levels < 5 ng/mL). The starting dose of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was 20 mg every 4 weeks for 3 doses. Thereafter, patients received 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg every 4 weeks, depending upon the degree of GH suppression [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Growth hormone and IGF-1 were at least as well controlled on octreotide acetate for injectable suspension as they had been on octreotide acetate injection. Table 5 summarizes the data on hormonal control (GH and IGF-1) for those patients in the first two clinical trials who received all 27 to 28 injections of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension.

Over the course of the trials, 42% of patients maintained mean growth hormone levels of < 2.5 ng/mL and mean normal IGF-1 levels. Table 6 summarizes the data on hormonal control (GH and IGF-1) for those patients in the third clinical trial who received all 12 injections of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Table 6.

Over the course of the trial, 57% of patients maintained mean growth hormone levels of < 2.5 ng/mL and mean normal IGF-1 levels. In comparing the hormonal response in these trials, note that a higher percentage of patients in the third trial suppressed their mean GH to < 5 ng/mL on subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection, 95%, compared to 78% across the 2 previous trials. In all 3 trials, GH, IGF-1, and clinical symptoms were similarly controlled on octreotide acetate for injectable suspension as they had been on octreotide acetate injection. Of the 25 patients who completed the trials and were partial responders to octreotide acetate injection (GH > 5.0 ng/mL but reduced by > 50% relative to untreated levels), 1 patient (4%) responded to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension with a reduction of GH to < 2.5 ng/mL and 8 patients (32%) responded with a reduction of GH to < 5.0 ng/mL. Two open-label clinical studies investigated a 48-week treatment with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension in 143 untreated (de novo) acromegalic patients. The median reduction in tumor volume was 20.6% in Study 1 (49 patients) at 24 weeks and 24.5% in Study 2 (94 patients) at 24 weeks and 36.2% at 48 weeks. 14.2 Carcinoid Syndrome A 6-month clinical trial of malignant carcinoid syndrome was performed in 93 patients who had previously been shown to be responsive to octreotide acetate injection. Sixty-seven (67) patients were randomized at baseline to receive double-blind doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension every 28 days and 26 patients continued, unblinded, on their previous octreotide acetate injection regimen (100 to 300 mcg three times daily). In any given month after steady-state levels of octreotide were reached, approximately 35% to 40% of the patients who received octreotide acetate for injectable suspension required supplemental subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection therapy usually for a few days, to control exacerbation of carcinoid symptoms. In any given month, the percentage of patients randomized to subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection, who required supplemental treatment with an increased dose of octreotide acetate injection, was similar to the percentage of patients randomized to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. Over the 6-month treatment period, approximately 50% to 70% of patients who completed the trial on octreotide acetate for injectable suspension required subcutaneous octreotide acetate injection supplemental therapy to control exacerbation of carcinoid symptoms although steady-state serum octreotide acetate for injectable suspension levels had been reached. Table 7 presents the average number of daily stools and flushing episodes in malignant carcinoid patients. Table 7. Average Number of Daily Stools and Flushing Episodes in Patients With Malignant Carcinoid Syndrome Daily Stools (Average Number) Daily Flushing Episodes (Average Number) n Baseline Last Visit Baseline Last Visit Octreotide Acetate Injection S.C. 26 3.7 2.6 3.0 0.5 Octreotide Acetate for Injectable Suspension 10 mg 22 4.6 2.8 3.0 0.9 20 mg 20 4.0 2.1 5.9 0.6 30 mg 24 4.9 2.8 6.1 1.0 Overall, mean daily stool frequency was as well controlled on octreotide acetate for injectable suspension as on octreotide acetate injection (approximately 2 to 2.5 stools/day). Mean daily flushing episodes were similar at all doses of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension and on octreotide acetate injection (approximately 0.5 to 1 episode/day). In a subset of patients with variable severity of disease, median 24 hour urinary 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindole acetic acid) levels were reduced by 38% to 50% in the groups randomized to octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. The reductions are within the range reported in the published literature for patients treated with octreotide (about 10% to 50%). Seventy-eight (78) patients with malignant carcinoid syndrome who had participated in this 6-month trial subsequently participated in a 12-month extension study in which they received 12 injections of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at 4-week intervals. For those who remained in the extension trial, diarrhea and flushing were as well controlled as during the 6-month trial. Because malignant carcinoid disease is progressive, as expected, a number of deaths (8 patients: 10%) occurred due to disease progression or complications from the underlying disease. An additional 22% of patients prematurely discontinued octreotide acetate for injectable suspension due to disease progression or worsening of carcinoid symptoms."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Octreotide acetate injection is a somatostatin analogue indicated: \u2022 Acromegaly: To reduce blood levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1; somatomedin C) in acromegaly patients who have had inadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgical resection, pituitary irradiation, and bromocriptine mesylate at maximally tolerated doses. ( 1.1 ) \u2022 Carcinoid Tumors: For the symptomatic treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors where it suppresses or inhibits the severe diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with the disease. ( 1.2 ) \u2022 V asoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors (VIPomas): For the treatment of profuse watery diarrhea associated with VIP-secreting tumors. ( 1.3 ) Limitations of Use Improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, or reduction in tumor size or rate of growth, were not shown in clinical trials performed with Octreotide acetate injection; these trials were not optimally designed to detect such effects. ( 1.4 ) 1.1 Acromegaly Octreotide acetate injection is indicated to reduce blood levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1; somatomedin C) in acromegaly patients who have had inadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgical resection, pituitary irradiation, and bromocriptine mesylate at maximally tolerated doses. 1.2 Carcinoid Tumors Octreotide acetate injection is indicated for treatment of severe diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors. 1.3 Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors Octreotide acetate injection is indicated for the treatment of the profuse watery diarrhea associated with vasoactive intestinal peptide tumors (VIPomas)-secreting tumors. 1.4 Important Limitations of Use Improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, or reduction in tumor size or rate of growth, were not shown in clinical trials performed with octreotide acetate injection; these trials were not optimally designed to detect such effects."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Acromegaly: Recommended initial octreotide acetate dosage is 50 mcg three times daily during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. Maintenance dose 100 mcg to 500 mcg three times daily. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Carcinoid Tumors: Recommended dosage range of 100 mcg to 600 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 VIPomas: Recommended dosage range of 200 mcg to 300 mcg daily in two to four divided doses during the initial 2 weeks of therapy. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Dosage and Administration Overview \u2022 Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. Pain with subcutaneous administration may be reduced by using the smallest volume that will deliver the desired dose. Sites should be rotated in a systematic manner. \u2022 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if particulates and/or discoloration are observed. Octreotide acetate injection is not compatible in Total Parenteral Nutrition solutions because of the formation of a glycosyl octreotide conjugate which may decrease the efficacy of the product. \u2022 Octreotide acetate injection may be diluted in volumes of 50 mL to 200 mL and infused intravenously over 15 to 30 minutes or administered by intravenous (IV) push over 3 minutes. In emergency situations (e.g., carcinoid crisis), it may be given by rapid bolus. \u2022 Assess total and/or free T4 levels at baseline and periodically during chronic octreotide acetate therapy. 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Acromegaly The recommended initial dosage of octreotide acetate is 50 mcg three times daily to be administered subcutaneously. Increase octreotide acetate dose based upon GH or IGF-1 levels. The goal is to achieve GH levels less than 5 ng/mL or IGF-1 levels within normal range. Monitor GH or IGF-1 every two weeks after initiating octreotide acetate therapy or with dosage change, and to guide titration. The most common dosage is 100 mcg three times daily, but some patients require up to 500 mcg three times daily for maximum effectiveness. Doses greater than 300 mcg/day seldom result in additional biochemical benefit, and if an increase in dose fails to provide additional benefit, the dose should be reduced. Octreotide acetate injection should be withdrawn yearly for approximately 4 weeks from patients who have received irradiation to assess disease activity. If GH or IGF-1 levels increase and signs and symptoms recur, octreotide acetate injection therapy may be resumed. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Carcinoid Tumors The recommended daily dosage of octreotide acetate injection during the first 2 weeks of therapy ranges from 100 to 600 mcg/day in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously (mean daily dosage is 300 mcg). In the clinical studies, the median daily maintenance dosage was approximately 450 mcg, but clinical and biochemical benefits were obtained in some patients with as little as 50 mcg, while others required doses up to 1,500 mcg/day. However, experience with doses above 750 mcg/day is limited. Measurement of urinary 5- hydroxyindole acetic acid, plasma serotonin, plasma Substance P may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy. 2.4 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors Daily dosages of 200 mcg to 300 mcg in two to four divided doses given subcutaneously are recommended during the initial 2 weeks of therapy (range, 150 mcg to 750 mcg) to control symptoms of the disease. On an individual basis, dosage may be adjusted to achieve a therapeutic response, but usually doses above 450 mcg/day are not required. Measurement of Plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac Function Abnormalities: Increased risk for higher degree of atrioventricular blocks. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Bradycardia, arrhythmias, or conduction abnormalities may occur. Use with caution in at-risk patients. Dosage adjustment of cardiac medications may be necessary. ( 5.1 ) Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis: Monitor periodically. Discontinue if complications of cholelithiasis are suspected. ( 5.2 ) Glucose Metabolism: Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia may occur. Glucose monitoring is recommended and anti-diabetic treatment may need adjustment. ( 5.3 ) Thyroid Function: Hypothyroidism may occur. Monitor thyroid levels periodically. ( 5.4 ) Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats: New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss may occur. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported, evaluate for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Cardiac Function Abnormalities Complete Atrioventricular Block Patients who receive octreotide acetate injection intravenously may be at increased risk for higher degree atrioventricular blocks. In postmarketing reports, complete atrioventricular block was reported in patients receiving IV octreotide acetate injection during surgical procedures. In the majority of patients, octreotide acetate injection was given at higher than recommended doses and/or as a continuous IV infusion. The safety of continuous IV infusion has not been established in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection for the approved indications. Consider cardiac monitoring in patients receiving octreotide acetate injection intravenously. Other Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities Other cardiac conduction abnormalities have occurred during treatment with octreotide acetate injection. In acromegalic patients, bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias occurred in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] . Other electrocardiogram (ECG) changes observed included QT prolongation, axis shifts, early repolarization, low voltage, R/S transition, and early R-wave progression. These ECG changes are not uncommon in acromegalic patients. Dose adjustments in drugs such as beta-blockers that have bradycardia effects may be necessary. In one acromegalic patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy resulted in worsening of CHF with improvement when drug was discontinued. Confirmation of a drug effect was obtained with a positive rechallenge. 5.2 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis Octreotide acetate injection may inhibit gallbladder contractility and decrease bile secretion, which may lead to gallbladder abnormalities or sludge. Acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, biliary obstruction, cholestatic hepatitis, or pancreatitis have been reported with octreotide acetate injection therapy. In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. One patient developed ascending cholangitis during octreotide acetate injection therapy and died. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue octreotide acetate injection and treat appropriately. 5.3 Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia Octreotide acetate injection alters the balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon and GH, which may result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia which occurs during octreotide acetate injection therapy is usually mild but may result in overt diabetes mellitus or necessitate dose changes in insulin or other anti-diabetic agents. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred on octreotide acetate injection in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] . Severe hyperglycemia, subsequent pneumonia, and death following initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy was reported in one patient with no history of hyperglycemia. Monitor glucose levels during octreotide acetate injection therapy. Adjust dosing of insulin or other anti-diabetic therapy accordingly. 5.4 Thyroid Function Abnormalities Octreotide suppresses secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which may result in hypothyroidism. Baseline and periodic assessment of thyroid function (TSH, total, and/or free T4) is recommended during chronic therapy [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] . 5.5 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration and loose stools have been reported in patients receiving somatostatin analogs, including octreotide acetate. Somatostatin analogs reversibly inhibit secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile acids, which may result in malabsorption of dietary fats and subsequent symptoms of steatorrhea, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported in patients receiving octreotide acetate, evaluate patients for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and manage accordingly. 5.6 Changes in Vitamin B12 Levels Depressed vitamin B 12 levels and abnormal Schilling\u2019s tests have been observed in some patients receiving octreotide acetate injection therapy, and monitoring of vitamin B 12 levels is recommended during octreotide acetate injection therapy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Complete Atrioventricular Block [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis [se e Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Thyroid Function Abnormalities [s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Changes in Vitamin B 12 Levels [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) in patients with acromegaly are gallbladder abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, abdominal discomfort, hyperglycemia, and hypothyroidism. In other patients, most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) are gallbladder abnormalities. ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Avet Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-866-901-DRUG (3784) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Gallbladder Abnormalities Gallbladder abnormalities, especially stones and/or biliary sludge, frequently develop in patients on chronic octreotide acetate injection therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] . In clinical trials (primarily patients with acromegaly or psoriasis), the incidence of biliary tract abnormalities was 63% (27% gallstones, 24% sludge without stones, 12% biliary duct dilatation). The incidence of stones or sludge in patients who received octreotide acetate injection for 12 months or longer was 52%. Less than 2% of patients treated with octreotide acetate injection for 1 month or less developed gallstones. Cardiac In acromegalics, sinus bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias developed in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Gastrointestinal Diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, and abdominal discomfort were each seen in 34% to 61% of acromegalic patients in U.S. studies. 2.6% of the patients discontinued therapy due to these symptoms. These symptoms were seen in 5% to 10% of patients with carcinoid tumors and VIPomas. The frequency of these symptoms was not dose related, but diarrhea and abdominal discomfort generally resolved more quickly in patients treated with 300 mcg/day than in those treated with 750 mcg/day. Vomiting, flatulence, abnormal stools, abdominal distention, and constipation were each seen in less than 10% of patients. In rare instances, gastrointestinal side effects may resemble acute intestinal obstruction, with progressive abdominal distension, severe epigastric pain, abdominal tenderness, and guarding. Hypo/Hyperglycemia Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively, but only in about 1.5% of other patients. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were noted in approximately 2% of patients. Hypothyroidism In acromegalics, biochemical hypothyroidism alone occurred in 12% while goiter occurred in 8% and 4% required initiation of thyroid replacement therapy during octreotide acetate injection therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] . In patients without acromegaly, hypothyroidism has only been reported in several isolated patients and goiter has not been reported. Other Adverse Events Pain on injection was reported in 7.7%, headache in 6%, and dizziness in 5%. Pancreatitis was also observed [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] . Other Adverse Events 1% to 4% Other events, each observed in 1% to 4% of patients, included fatigue, weakness, pruritus, joint pain, backache, urinary tract infection, cold symptoms, flu symptoms, injection site hematoma, bruise, edema, flushing, blurred vision, pollakiuria, fat malabsorption, hair loss, visual disturbance, and depression. Anaphylactoid reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported in several patients receiving octreotide acetate injection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of octreotide acetate Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary: cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cholangitis and pancreatitis, which have sometimes required cholecystectomy Gastrointestinal: intestinal obstruction, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency Hematologic: thrombocytopenia"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 The following drugs require monitoring and possible dose adjustment when used with octreotide acetate injection : cyclosporine, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, beta-blockers, and bromocriptine. ( 7 ) \u2022 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection: Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Cyclosporine Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. Concomitant administration of octreotide acetate injection with cyclosporine may decrease blood levels of cyclosporine and result in transplant rejection. 7.2 Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Drugs Octreotide inhibits the secretion of insulin and glucagon. Therefore, blood glucose levels should be monitored when octreotide acetate injection treatment is initiated or when the dose is altered and anti-diabetic treatment should be adjusted accordingly. 7.3 Bromocriptine Concomitant administration of octreotide and bromocriptine increases the availability of bromocriptine. 7.4 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy Concomitant administration of bradycardia-inducing drugs (e.g., beta-blockers) may have an additive effect on the reduction of heart rate associated with octreotide. Dose adjustments of concomitant medication may be necessary. Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs. 7.5 Drug Metabolism Interactions Limited published data indicate that somatostatin analogs might decrease the metabolic clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which may be due to the suppression of GH. Since it cannot be excluded that octreotide may have this effect, other drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and which have a low therapeutic index (e.g., quinidine, terfenadine) should therefore be used with caution. 7.6 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate Injection Octreotide competitively binds to somatostatin receptors and may interfere with the efficacy of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Discontinue octreotide acetate injection at least 24 hours prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited data with octreotide acetate injection in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental-effects were observed with IV administration of octreotide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 7- and 13-times, respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.5 mg/day based on body surface area (BSA). Transient growth retardation, with no impact on postnatal development, was observed in rat offspring from a pre- and post-natal study of octreotide at IV doses below the MRHD based on BSA ( see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data In postmarketing data, a limited number of exposed pregnancies have been reported in patients with acromegaly. Most women were exposed to octreotide during the first trimester of pregnancy at doses ranging from 100 to 300 mcg/day of octreotide acetate injection or 20 mg to 30 mg once a month of octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, however some women elected to continue octreotide therapy throughout pregnancy. In cases with a known outcome, no congenital malformations were reported. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received IV doses of octreotide up to 1 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. A slight reduction in body weight gain was noted in pregnant rats at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day. There were no maternal effects in rabbits or embryo-fetal effects in either species up to the maximum dose tested. At 1 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, the dose multiple was approximately 7- and 13-times, respectively, at the highest recommended human dose of 1.5 mg/day based on BSA. In a pre- and post-natal development rat study at IV doses of 0.02 to 1 mg/kg/day, a transient growth retardation of the offspring was observed at all doses which was possibly a consequence of GH inhibition by octreotide. The doses attributed to the delayed growth are below the human dose of 1.5 mg/day, based on BSA. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of octreotide acetate in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies show that octreotide administered subcutaneously passes into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk (see Data). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for octreotide acetate injection, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from octreotide acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Following a subcutaneous dose (1 mg/kg) of octreotide to lactating rats, transfer of octreotide into milk was observed at a low concentration compared to plasma (milk/plasma ratio of 0.009). 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as the therapeutic benefits of a reduction in GH levels and normalization of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration in acromegalic females treated with octreotide may lead to improved fertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of octreotide acetate injection in the pediatric population have not been demonstrated. No formal controlled clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of octreotide acetate injection in pediatric patients under age 6 years. In postmarketing reports, serious adverse events, including hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death, have been reported with octreotide acetate injection use in children, most notably in children under 2 years of age. The relationship of these events to octreotide has not been established as the majority of these pediatric patients had serious underlying co-morbid conditions. The efficacy and safety of octreotide acetate injection using the octreotide acetate for injectable suspension formulation was examined in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6 month pharmacokinetics study in 60 pediatric patients age 6 to 17 years with hypothalamic obesity resulting from cranial insult. The mean octreotide concentration after 6 doses of 40 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by intramuscular (IM) injection every 4 weeks was approximately 3 ng/mL. Steady-state concentrations was achieved after 3 injections of a 40-mg dose. Mean body mass index (BMI) increased 0.1 kg/m2 in octreotide acetate for injectable suspension-treated subjects compared to 0.0 kg/m2 in saline control-treated subjects. Efficacy was not demonstrated. Diarrhea occurred in 11 of 30 (37%) patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. No unexpected adverse events were observed. However, with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adult indications such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was 10 mg to 30 mg once a month. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of octreotide acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, the half-life of octreotide acetate may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment-Cirrhotic Patients In patients with liver cirrhosis, the half-life of the drug may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE A limited number of accidental overdoses of octreotide acetate injection in adults have been reported. In adults, the doses ranged from 2,400 to 6,000 mcg/day administered by continuous infusion (100 to 250 mcg/hour) or subcutaneously (1,500 mcg 3 times a day). Adverse events in some patients included arrhythmia, complete atrioventricular block, hypotension, cardiac arrest, brain hypoxia, pancreatitis, hepatitis steatosis, hepatomegaly, lactic acidosis, flushing, diarrhea, lethargy, weakness, and weight loss.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Octreotide acetate injection exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin. It is an even more potent inhibitor of GH, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it also suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, VIP, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide. By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and VIP secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Octreotide substantially reduces GH and/or IGF-1 (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly. Single doses of octreotide have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] . Octreotide suppresses secretion of TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection, octreotide is absorbed rapidly and completely from the injection site. Peak concentrations of 5.2 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) were reached 0.4 hours after dosing. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, IV and subcutaneous doses were found to be bioequivalent. Peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) values were dose proportional after IV single doses up to 200 mcg and subcutaneous single doses up to 500 mcg and after subcutaneous multiple doses up to 500 mcg 3 times a day (1,500 mcg/day). In patients with acromegaly, a mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing. Distribution In healthy volunteers, the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (t\u03b1\u00bd = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (Vdss) was estimated to be 13.6 L, and the total body clearance ranged from 7 L/hr to 10 L/hr. In blood, the distribution into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner. Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. In patients with acromegaly, the volume of distribution (Vdss) was estimated to be 21.6 \u00b1 8.5 L, and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h. The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%. Elimination The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 to 1.9 hours compared with 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone. The duration of action of octreotide acetate injection is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor. About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine. In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug. In patients with acromegaly, the disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normal subjects. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR 40 to 60 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 2.4 hours and total body clearance was 8.8 L/hr, in moderate impairment (CL CR 10 to 39 mL/min) t 1/2 was 3.0 hours and total body clearance 7.3 L/hr. In patients with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis (CL CR < 10 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 3.1 hours and total body clearance was 7.6 L/hr. In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, total body clearance was reduced to about half that found in healthy subjects (from approximately 10 L/hr to 4.5 L/hr). Hepatic Impairment Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide t1/2 increasing to 3.7 hr and total body clearance decreasing to 5.9 L/hr, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed t1/2 increased to 3.4 hr and total body clearance of 8.2 L/hr. 12.6 Immunogenicity Evaluation of 20 patients treated for at least 6 months has failed to demonstrate titers of antibodies exceeding background levels. However, antibody titers to octreotide acetate injection were subsequently reported in 3 patients and resulted in prolonged duration of drug action in 2 patients."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated no mutagenic potential of octreotide acetate injection. No carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in mice treated subcutaneously for 85 to 99 weeks at doses up to 2,000 mcg/kg/day (8 x the human exposure based on BSA). In a 116-week subcutaneous study in rats, a 27% and 12% incidence of injection-site sarcomas or squamous cell carcinomas was observed in males and females, respectively, at the highest dose level of 1,250 mcg/kg/day (10 x the human exposure based on BSA) compared to an incidence of 8% to 10% in the vehicle-control groups. The increased incidence of injection-site tumors was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to repeated subcutaneous injections at the same site. Rotating injection sites would prevent chronic irritation in humans. There have been no reports of injection-site tumors in patients treated with octreotide acetate for up to 5 years. There was also a 15% incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas in the 1,250 mcg/kg/day females compared to 7% in the saline-control females and 0% in the vehicle-control females. The presence of endometritis coupled with the absence of corpora lutea, the reduction in mammary fibroadenomas, and the presence of uterine dilatation suggest that the uterine tumors were associated with estrogen dominance in the aged female rats which does not occur in humans. Octreotide did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 1,000 mcg/kg/day, which represents 7-times the human exposure based on BSA."
