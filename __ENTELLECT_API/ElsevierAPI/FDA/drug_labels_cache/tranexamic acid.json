      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Before Extraction: Administer 10 mg/kg actual body weight of tranexamic acid injection intravenously with replacement therapy. ( 2.1 ) After Extraction: Administer 10 mg/kg actual body weight 3 to 4 times daily for 2 to 8 days. Infuse no more than 1 mL/minute to avoid hypotension. ( 2.1 ) Reduce the dosage for patients with renal impairment. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dose of tranexamic acid injection is 10 mg/kg actual body weight intravenously administered as a single-dose, immediately before tooth extractions. Infuse no more than 1 mL/minute to avoid hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Following tooth extraction, tranexamic acid injection may be administered for 2 to 8 days at a dose of 10 mg/kg actual body weight 3 to 4 times daily, intravenously. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For intravenous infusion, tranexamic acid injection may be mixed with most solutions for infusion such as electrolyte solutions, carbohydrate solutions, amino acid solutions, and Dextran solutions. Heparin may be added to tranexamic acid injection. Tranexamic acid injection should NOT be mixed with blood. The drug is a synthetic amino acid and should NOT be mixed with solutions containing penicillin. Discard any unused portion. The diluted mixture may be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature prior to patient administration. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Patients With Varying Degrees of Renal Impairment * For patients with moderate to severe impaired renal function, the following dosages are recommended: Table 1: Recommended Dosage in Patients With Varying Degrees of Renal Impairment * Dose reduction is recommended for all doses, both before and after tooth extraction.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.1 ) Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration: FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid injection. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . 5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid injection. Syringes containing tranexamic acid injection should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration. 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid injection may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1,600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid injection may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid injection affects them."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Avenacy Inc. at 1-855-283-6229 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data ) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid injection in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient's serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid and other drugs have been conducted."

Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.1 ) Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration: FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . 5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid injection. Syringes containing tranexamic acid injection should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration. 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid affects them."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient's serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid and other drugs have been conducted."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

Concomitant use of tranexamic acid USP tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives, Factor I X complex concentrates, anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates or all-trans retinoic acid (oral tretinoin) may increase the risk of thrombosis. ( 5.1 ) Visual or ocular adverse reactions may occur with tranexamic acid USP tablets. Immediately discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) In case of severe allergic reaction, discontinue tranexamic acid USP tablets and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.2 ) Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid USP tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. ( 5.3 ) Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism, as well as cases of retinal artery and retinal vein occlusions, have been reported with tranexamic acid USP tablets. Retinal venous and arterial occlusion have been reported in patients using tranexamic acid. Patients should be instructed to report visual and ocular symptoms promptly. In the event of such symptoms, patients should be instructed to discontinue tranexamic acid USP tablets immediately and should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including dilated retinal examination, to exclude the possibility of retinal venous or arterial occlusion. Concomitant Use of Hormonal Contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Because tranexamic acid USP tablets are antifibrinolytic, the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke, may increase further when combined hormonal contraceptives are administered with tranexamic acid USP tablets. This is of particular concern in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes, especially smokers over 35 years of age. Women using combined hormonal contraception were excluded from the clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid USP tablets, and there are no clinical trial data on the risk of thrombotic events with the concomitant use of tranexamic acid USP tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives. However, there have been US postmarketing reports of venous and arterial thrombotic events in women who have used tranexamic acid USP tablets concomitantly with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Concomitant Use with Factor I X Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid USP tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor I X complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Taking Concomitant All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid USP tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.2 Severe Allergic Reactions A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid USP tablets was reported in the clinical trials, involving a subject who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. A case of anaphylactic shock has also been reported in the literature, involving a patient who received an intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid USP tablets are contraindicated in females of reproductive potential with known hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid USP tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. 5.4 Ligneous Conjunctivitis Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. The conjunctivitis resolved following cessation of tranexamic acid USP tablets."

Adverse Reactions in Short-term Studies The safety of tranexamic acid USP tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in females of reproductive potential was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid USP tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo over a 3-cycle treatment duration. A total of 304 women were randomized to this study, with 115 receiving at least one dose of 3900 mg/day of tranexamic acid USP tablets. Study 2 compared the effects of tranexamic acid USP tablets (3900 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6-cycle treatment duration. A total of 196 women were randomized to this study, with 117 receiving at least one dose of tranexamic acid USP tablets. Across the studies, the combined exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid USP tablets was 947 cycles and the average duration of use was 3.4 days per cycle. In both studies, subjects were generally healthy women who had menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL. In these studies, subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21\u201335 days, and a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the trials. A list of adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid USP tablets-treated subjects receiving 3900 mg/day compared to placebo-treated subjects is provided in Table 2.

In one study, subjects with physician-diagnosed heavy menstrual bleeding (not using the alkaline hematin methodology) were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 781 subjects were enrolled and 239 completed the study through 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 12.4% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the study. The total exposure in this study to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid USP tablets was 10,213 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid USP tablets use was 2.9 days per cycle. A long-term open-label extension study of subjects from the two short-term efficacy studies was also conducted in which subjects were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 288 subjects were enrolled and 196 subjects completed the study through 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 2.1% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. The total exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid USP tablets in this study was 1,956 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid USP tablets use was 3.5 days per cycle. The types and severity of adverse reactions in these two long-term open-label trials were similar to those observed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies although the percentage of subjects reporting them was greater in the 27-month study, most likely because of the longer study duration. A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid USP tablets was reported in the extension trial, involving a subject on her fourth cycle of treatment, who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with tranexamic acid USP tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders: Impaired color vision and other visual disturbances Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Immune system disorders: Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reactions Nervous system disorders: Dizziness Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Allergic skin reactions Vascular disorders: Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery and vein obstruction); cases have been associated with concomitant use of combined hormonal contraceptives"

There is no available data on tranexamic acid USP tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. Animal reproduction studies have not identified adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tranexamic acid to pregnant rats at doses up to 4 times the recommended human dose (see Data ). In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, tranexamic acid had no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when administered during the period of organogenesis (from gestation days 6 through 17) at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg (1, 2 and 4 times the recommended human oral dosage of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 )). In a perinatal-postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats administered tranexamic acid from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg, no significant adverse effects on maternal behavior or body weight were observed, and no significant effects on pup viability, body weight, developmental milestones or adult fertility were observed. It was concluded that the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1500 mg/kg/day in both F 0 and F 1 generations, which is equivalent to 4 times the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tranexamic acid is present in the mother\u2019s milk at a concentration of about one hundredth of the corresponding serum concentration (see Data ). The amount of tranexamic acid a nursing infant would absorb is unknown. There are no adequate data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects of tranexamic acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid USP tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from tranexamic acid USP tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Human Data One hour after the last dose following a 2-day treatment course in lactating women, the milk concentration of the tranexamic acid was 1% of the peak serum concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of tranexamic acid USP tablets have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for those 17 years and older. Tranexamic acid USP tablets are not indicated before menarche. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tranexamic acid USP tablets are indicated for females of reproductive potential and is not intended for use by postmenopausal women. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid USP tablets has not been studied. Because tranexamic acid is primarily eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration with more than 95% excreted as unchanged in urine, the recommended dosage in patient with renal impairment is lower than the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid USP tablets has not been studied. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, at in vitro concentrations of 25\u2013100 \u03bcM, reduces by 20\u201360% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving tranexamic acid total oral doses of 2\u20133 g/day for 5 days. In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid USP tablets on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid USP tablets 1300 mg (2) tranexamic acid USP tablets 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid USP tablets. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid USP tablets, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid USP tablets in women aged 18\u201349 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid USP tablets for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg ). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5th dose of tranexamic acid USP tablets on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg ) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid USP tablets are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of tranexamic acid USP tablets in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2219h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 AUC 0-tau (mcg\u00b7h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2219h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) Data presented as median (range) 2.5 (1 \u2013 5) 2.5 (2 \u2013 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - Effect of food: Tranexamic acid USP tablets may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg ) of tranexamic acid USP tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110\u2013116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid USP tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32\u201336% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20\u201325% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid USP tablets has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4\u20132.8, 2.8\u20135.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid USP tablets has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid USP tablets. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid USP tablets is not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ]."

Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid USP tablets on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid USP tablets 1300 mg (2) tranexamic acid USP tablets 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid USP tablets. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid USP tablets, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid USP tablets in women aged 18\u201349 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid USP tablets for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg ). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5th dose of tranexamic acid USP tablets on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg ) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid USP tablets are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of tranexamic acid USP tablets in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2219h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 AUC 0-tau (mcg\u00b7h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2219h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) Data presented as median (range) 2.5 (1 \u2013 5) 2.5 (2 \u2013 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - Effect of food: Tranexamic acid USP tablets may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg ) of tranexamic acid USP tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110\u2013116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid USP tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32\u201336% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20\u201325% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid USP tablets has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4\u20132.8, 2.8\u20135.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid USP tablets has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid USP tablets. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid USP tablets is not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ]."

Female mice were not included in this experiment. The dose multiple referenced above is based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Actual daily dose in mice was up to 5000 mg/kg/day in food. Hyperplasia of the biliary tract and cholangioma and adenocarcinoma of the intrahepatic biliary system have been reported in one strain of rats after dietary administration of doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose for 22 months. Hyperplastic, but not neoplastic, lesions were reported at lower doses. Subsequent long-term dietary administration studies in a different strain of rat, each with an exposure level equal to the maximum level employed in the earlier experiment, have failed to show such hyperplastic/neoplastic changes in the liver. Mutagenesis Tranexamic acid was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in the in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames test), in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster cells, and in in vivo chromosome aberration tests in mice and rats. Impairment of Fertility Reproductive studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits have not revealed any evidence of impaired fertility or adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Ocular Effects In a 9-month toxicology study, dogs were administered tranexamic acid in food at doses of 0, 200, 600, or 1200 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 2, 5, and 6 times, respectively, the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on AUC. At 6 times the human dose, some dogs developed reversible reddening and gelatinous discharge from the eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed reversible changes in the nictitating membrane/conjunctiva. In some female dogs, the presence of inflammatory exudate over the bulbar conjunctival mucosa was observed. Histopathological examinations did not reveal any retinal alteration. No adverse effects were observed at 5 times the human dose. In other studies, focal areas of retinal degeneration were observed in cats, dogs and rats following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid doses at 6\u201340 times the recommended usual human dose based on mg/m 2 (actual animal doses between 250\u20131600 mg/kg/day)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of the Clinical Studies The efficacy of tranexamic acid USP tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women of reproductive potential was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: one 3-cycle treatment study (Study 1) and one 6-cycle treatment study (Study 2) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In these studies, HMB was defined as an average menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL as assessed by alkaline hematin analysis of collected sanitary products over two baseline menstrual cycles. Subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21\u201335 days, and a BMI of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had an HMB history of approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. In these studies, the primary outcome measure was menstrual blood loss (MBL), measured using the alkaline hematin method. The endpoint was change from baseline in MBL, calculated by subtracting the mean MBL during treatment from the mean pretreatment MBL. The key secondary outcome measures were based on specific questions concerning limitations in social or leisure activities (LSLA) and limitations in physical activities (LPA). Large stains (soiling beyond the undergarment) were also included as a key secondary outcome measure. 14.2 Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in the Three-Cycle Treatment Study Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid USP tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo on MBL over a 3-cycle treatment duration. Of the 294 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid USP tablets 1950 mg/day, 112 subjects received tranexamic acid USP tablets 3900 mg/day and 67 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 4. Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid USP tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. The 1950 mg/day tranexamic acid USP tablets dose did not meet the criteria for success. Table 4.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolism, including retinal occlusion, has been reported with tranexamic acid tablets use. Concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives, Factor IX complex concentrates, anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates or all-trans retinoic acid (oral tretinoin) may increase the risk of thrombosis. ( 5.1 ) Visual or ocular adverse reactions may occur with tranexamic acid tablets. Immediately discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) In case of severe allergic reaction, discontinue tranexamic acid tablets and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.2 ) Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. ( 5.3 ) Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking Tranexamic acid tablets. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism, as well as cases of retinal artery and retinal vein occlusions, have been reported with tranexamic acid tablets. Retinal venous and arterial occlusion have been reported in patients using tranexamic acid tablets. Patients should be instructed to report visual and ocular symptoms promptly. In the event of such symptoms, patients should be instructed to discontinue tranexamic acid tablets immediately and should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including dilated retinal examination, to exclude the possibility of retinal venous or arterial occlusion. Concomitant Use of Hormonal Contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Because tranexamic acid tablets are antifibrinolytic, the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke, may increase further when combined hormonal contraceptives are administered with tranexamic acid tablets. This is of particular concern in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes, especially smokers over 35 years of age. Women using combined hormonal contraception were excluded from the clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid tablets, and there are no clinical trial data on the risk of thrombotic events with the concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives. However, there have been US postmarketing reports of venous and arterial thrombotic events in women who have used tranexamic acid tablets concomitantly with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Concomitant Use with Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Taking Concomitant All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.2 Severe Allergic Reactions A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid tablets was reported in the clinical trials, involving a subject who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. A case of anaphylactic shock has also been reported in the literature, involving a patient who received an intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid tablets are contraindicated in females of reproductive potential with known hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. 5.4 Ligneous Conjunctivitis Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid tablets. The conjunctivitis resolved following cessation of tranexamic acid tablets."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (\u2265 5%, and more frequent in tranexamic acid tablets-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects) are headache, sinus and nasal symptoms, back pain, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, joint pain, muscle cramps, migraine, anemia and fatigue.

Adverse Reactions in Short-term Studies The safety of tranexamic acid tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in females of reproductive potential was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ]. Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo over a 3-cycle treatment duration. A total of 304 women were randomized to this study, with 115 receiving at least one dose of 3900 mg/day of tranexamic acid tablets. Study 2 compared the effects of tranexamic acid tablets (3900 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6-cycle treatment duration. A total of 196 women were randomized to this study, with 117 receiving at least one dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Across the studies, the combined exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 947 cycles and the average duration of use was 3.4 days per cycle. In both studies, subjects were generally healthy women who had menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL. In these studies, subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21-35 days, and a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the trials. A list of adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid tablets-treated subjects receiving 3900 mg/day compared to placebo-treated subjects is provided in Table 2. Table 2.

In one study, subjects with physician-diagnosed heavy menstrual bleeding (not using the alkaline hematin methodology) were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 781 subjects were enrolled and 239 completed the study through 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 12.4% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the study. The total exposure in this study to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 10,213 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablets use was 2.9 days per cycle. A long-term open-label extension study of subjects from the two short-term efficacy studies was also conducted in which subjects were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 288 subjects were enrolled and 196 subjects completed the study through 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 2.1% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. The total exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets in this study was 1,956 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablets use was 3.5 days per cycle. The types and severity of adverse reactions in these two long-term open-label trials were similar to those observed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies although the percentage of subjects reporting them was greater in the 27-month study, most likely because of the longer study duration. A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid tablets was reported in the extension trial, involving a subject on her fourth cycle of treatment, who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with tranexamic acid tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders: Impaired color vision and other visual disturbances Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Immune system disorders: Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reactions Nervous system disorders: Dizziness Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Allergic skin reactions Vascular disorders: Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery and vein obstruction); cases have been associated with concomitant use of combined hormonal contraceptives"

Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid tablets and tissue plasminogen activators. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Because tranexamic acid tablets are antifibrinolytic, concomitant use of combined hormonal contraception and tranexamic acid tablets may increase the thrombotic risk associated with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.2 Tissue Plasminogen Activators Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid tablets and tissue plasminogen activators. Discontinue tranexamic acid tablets if a patient requires tissue plasminogen activators. 7.3 Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) 7.4 All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric use: Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated for use in postmenopausal women ( 8.5 ) Renal impairment: A lower dosage is needed. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) Hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is needed. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated for use in pregnant women. There are no available data on tranexamic acid tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. Animal reproduction studies have not identified adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tranexamic acid to pregnant rats at doses up to 4 times the recommended human dose (see Data ) . In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, tranexamic acid had no adverse effects on embryo- fetal development when administered during the period of organogenesis (from gestation days 6 through 17) at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg (1, 2 and 4 times the recommended human oral dosage of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). In a perinatal-postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats administered tranexamic acid from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg, no significant adverse effects on maternal behavior or body weight were observed, and no significant effects on pup viability, body weight, developmental milestones or adult fertility were observed. It was concluded that the no- observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1500 mg/kg/day in both F 0 and F 1 generations, which is equivalent to 4 times the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tranexamic acid is present in the mother\u2019s milk at a concentration of about one hundredth of the corresponding serum concentration (see Data ). The amount of tranexamic acid a nursing infant would absorb is unknown. There are no adequate data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects of tranexamic acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from tranexamic acid tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Human Data One hour after the last dose following a 2-day treatment course in lactating women, the milk concentration of the tranexamic acid was 1% of the peak serum concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of tranexamic acid tablets have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for those 17 years and older. Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated before menarche. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive potential and is not intended for use by postmenopausal women. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid tablets has not been studied. Because tranexamic acid is primarily eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration with more than 95% excreted as unchanged in urine, the recommended dosage in patient with renal impairment is lower than the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid tablets has not been studied. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u00b5mol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u00b5mol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, at in vitro concentrations of 25 - 100 \u00b5M, reduces by 20 - 60% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving tranexamic acid tablets total oral doses of 2-3 g/day for 5 days. In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid tablets on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid tablets 1300 mg (2) tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid tablets, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid tablets in women aged 18-49 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid tablets for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5 th dose of tranexamic acid tablets on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid tablets are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2219h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 a (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2219h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) b 2.5 (1 \u2013 5) 2.5 (2 \u2013 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life a AUC 0-tau (mcg\u00b7h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours b Data presented as median (range) Effect of food : Tranexamic acid tablets may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110-116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 \u2013 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 \u2013 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study. [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of Tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid tablets. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies with tranexamic acid in male mice at doses as high as 6 times the recommended human dose of 3900 mg/day showed an increased incidence of leukemia which may have been related to treatment. Female mice were not included in this experiment. The dose multiple referenced above is based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Actual daily dose in mice was up to 5000 mg/kg/day in food. Hyperplasia of the biliary tract and cholangioma and adenocarcinoma of the intrahepatic biliary system have been reported in one strain of rats after dietary administration of doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose for 22 months. Hyperplastic, but not neoplastic, lesions were reported at lower doses. Subsequent long-term dietary administration studies in a different strain of rat, each with an exposure level equal to the maximum level employed in the earlier experiment, have failed to show such hyperplastic/neoplastic changes in the liver. Mutagenesis Tranexamic acid was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in the in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames test), in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster cells, and in in vivo chromosome aberration tests in mice and rats. Impairment of Fertility Reproductive studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits have not revealed any evidence of impaired fertility or adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Ocular Effects In a 9-month toxicology study, dogs were administered tranexamic acid in food at doses of 0, 200, 600, or 1200 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 2, 5, and 6 times, respectively, the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on AUC. At 6 times the human dose, some dogs developed reversible reddening and gelatinous discharge from the eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed reversible changes in the nictitating membrane/conjunctiva. In some female dogs, the presence of inflammatory exudate over the bulbar conjunctival mucosa was observed. Histopathological examinations did not reveal any retinal alteration. No adverse effects were observed at 5 times the human dose. In other studies, focal areas of retinal degeneration were observed in cats, dogs and rats following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid doses at 6-40 times the recommended usual human dose based on mg/m 2 (actual animal doses between 250-1600 mg/kg/day)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of the Clinical Studies The efficacy of tranexamic acid tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women of reproductive potential was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: one 3-cycle treatment study (Study 1) and one 6-cycle treatment study (Study 2) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. In these studies, HMB was defined as an average menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL as assessed by alkaline hematin analysis of collected sanitary products over two baseline menstrual cycles. Subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21-35 days, and a BMI of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had an HMB history of approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. In these studies, the primary outcome measure was menstrual blood loss (MBL), measured using the alkaline hematin method. The endpoint was change from baseline in MBL, calculated by subtracting the mean MBL during treatment from the mean pretreatment MBL. The key secondary outcome measures were based on specific questions concerning limitations in social or leisure activities (LSLA) and limitations in physical activities (LPA). Large stains (soiling beyond the undergarment) were also included as a key secondary outcome measure. 14.2 Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in the Three-Cycle Treatment Study Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo on MBL over a 3-cycle treatment duration. Of the 294 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 1950 mg/day, 112 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg/day and 67 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post- treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 4. Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. The 1950 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets dose did not meet the criteria for success. Table 4.

No statistically significant treatment difference was observed in response rates on the number of large stains.

Of the 187 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets and 72 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 6. MBL was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. Table 6.

The change in menstrual bleeding loss from baseline was similar across all post-baseline treatment cycles.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with concomitant use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use ( 5.1 ). Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures ( 5.2 ). Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention ( 5.3 ). Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur ( 5.4 ). Dizziness. Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs ( 5.5 ). 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . 5.2 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not FDA approved and which uses doses of up to ten-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if seizures occur. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.4 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.5 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection affects them."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration ( see Data ). Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adult and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient's serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to seven or eight hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and other drugs have been conducted."

In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to seven or eight hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and other drugs have been conducted."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolism, including retinal occlusion, has been reported with tranexamic acid tablets use. Concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives, Factor IX complex concentrates, anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates or all-trans retinoic acid (oral tretinoin) may increase the risk of thrombosis. ( 5.1 ) Visual or ocular adverse reactions may occur with tranexamic acid tablets. Immediately discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) In case of severe allergic reaction, discontinue tranexamic acid tablets and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.2 ) Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. ( 5.3 ) Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism, as well as cases of retinal artery and retinal vein occlusions, have been reported with tranexamic acid tablets. Retinal venous and arterial occlusion have been reported in patients using tranexamic acid tablets. Patients should be instructed to report visual and ocular symptoms promptly. In the event of such symptoms, patients should be instructed to discontinue tranexamic acid tablets immediately and should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including dilated retinal examination, to exclude the possibility of retinal venous or arterial occlusion. Concomitant Use of Hormonal Contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Because tranexamic acid tablets are antifibrinolytic, the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke, may increase further when combined hormonal contraceptives are administered with tranexamic acid tablets. This is of particular concern in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes, especially smokers over 35 years of age. Women using combined hormonal contraception were excluded from the clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid tablets, and there are no clinical trial data on the risk of thrombotic events with the concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives. However, there have been US postmarketing reports of venous and arterial thrombotic events in women who have used tranexamic acid tablets concomitantly with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Concomitant Use with Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets is not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Taking Concomitant All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.2 Severe Allergic Reactions A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid tablets was reported in the clinical trials, involving a subject who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. A case of anaphylactic shock has also been reported in the literature, involving a patient who received an intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid tablets are contraindicated in females of reproductive potential with known hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. 5.4 Ligneous Conjunctivitis Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. The conjunctivitis resolved following cessation of tranexamic acid tablets."

Adverse Reactions in Short-term Studies The safety of tranexamic acid tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in females of reproductive potential was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo over a 3-cycle treatment duration. A total of 304 women were randomized to this study, with 115 receiving at least one dose of 3900 mg/day of tranexamic acid tablets. Study 2 compared the effects of tranexamic acid tablets (3900 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6-cycle treatment duration. A total of 196 women were randomized to this study, with 117 receiving at least one dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Across the studies, the combined exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 947 cycles and the average duration of use was 3.4 days per cycle. In both studies, subjects were generally healthy women who had menstrual blood loss of \u226580 mL. In these studies, subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21 to 35 days, and a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the trials. A list of adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid tablets-treated subjects receiving 3900 mg/day compared to placebo-treated subjects is provided in Table 2.

In one study, subjects with physician-diagnosed heavy menstrual bleeding (not using the alkaline hematin methodology) were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 781 subjects were enrolled and 239 completed the study through 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 12.4% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the study. The total exposure in this study to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 10,213 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablets use was 2.9 days per cycle. A long-term open-label extension study of subjects from the two short-term efficacy studies was also conducted in which subjects were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 288 subjects were enrolled and 196 subjects completed the study through 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 2.1% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. The total exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets in this study was 1,956 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablets use was 3.5 days per cycle. The types and severity of adverse reactions in these two long-term open-label trials were similar to those observed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies although the percentage of subjects reporting them was greater in the 27-month study, most likely because of the longer study duration. A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid tablets was reported in the extension trial, involving a subject on her fourth cycle of treatment, who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders: Impaired color vision and other visual disturbances Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Immune system disorders: Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reactions Nervous system disorders: Dizziness Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Allergic skin reactions Vascular disorders: Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery and vein obstruction); cases have been associated with concomitant use of combined hormonal contraceptives"

Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid tablets and tissue plasminogen activators. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Because tranexamic acid tablets are antifibrinolytic, concomitant use of combined hormonal contraception and tranexamic acid tablets may increase the thrombotic risk associated with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.2 Tissue Plasminogen Activators Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid tablets and tissue plasminogen activators. Discontinue tranexamic acid tablets if a patient requires tissue plasminogen activators. 7.3 Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 7.4 All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

( 2.2 , 8.6 ) Hepatic impairment: A lower dosage is needed. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated for use in pregnant women . There are no available data on tranexamic acid tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. Animal reproduction studies have not identified adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tranexamic acid to pregnant rats at doses up to 4 times the recommended human dose (see Data) . In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, tranexamic acid had no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when administered during the period of organogenesis (from gestation days 6 through 17) at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg (1, 2 and 4 times the recommended human oral dosage of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 )). In a perinatal-postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats administered tranexamic acid from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg, no significant adverse effects on maternal behavior or body weight were observed, and no significant effects on pup viability, body weight, developmental milestones or adult fertility were observed. It was concluded that the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1500 mg/kg/day in both F 0 and F 1 generations, which is equivalent to 4 times the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tranexamic acid is present in the mother\u2019s milk at a concentration of about one hundredth of the corresponding serum concentration (see Data). The amount of tranexamic acid a nursing infant would absorb is unknown. There are no adequate data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects of tranexamic acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from tranexamic acid tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Human Data One hour after the last dose following a 2-day treatment course in lactating women, the milk concentration of the tranexamic acid was 1% of the peak serum concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of tranexamic acid tablets have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for those 17 years and older. Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated before menarche. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive potential and are not intended for use by postmenopausal women. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid tablets has not been studied. Because tranexamic acid is primarily eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration with more than 95% excreted as unchanged in urine, the recommended dosage in patients with renal impairment is lower than the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid tablets has not been studied. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u00b5mol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u00b5mol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, at in vitro concentrations of 25 to 100 \u03bcM, reduces by 20 to 60% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving tranexamic acid total oral doses of 2 to 3 g/day for 5 days. In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid tablets on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid tablets 1300 mg, (2) tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid tablets, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid tablets in women aged 18 to 49 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid tablets for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5 th dose of tranexamic acid tablets on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid tablets are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2022h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 a (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2022h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) b 2.5 (1 to 5) 2.5 (2 to 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life a AUC 0-tau (mcg\u2022h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours b Data presented as median (range) Effect of food : Tranexamic acid tablets may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110 to 116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 to 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 to 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of Tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid tablets. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u00b5mol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u00b5mol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, at in vitro concentrations of 25 to 100 \u03bcM, reduces by 20 to 60% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving tranexamic acid total oral doses of 2 to 3 g/day for 5 days. In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid tablets on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid tablets 1300 mg, (2) tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid tablets, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid tablets in women aged 18 to 49 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid tablets for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5 th dose of tranexamic acid tablets on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid tablets are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2022h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 a (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2022h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) b 2.5 (1 to 5) 2.5 (2 to 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life a AUC 0-tau (mcg\u2022h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours b Data presented as median (range) Effect of food : Tranexamic acid tablets may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110 to 116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 to 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 to 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of Tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid tablets. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

Female mice were not included in this experiment. The dose multiple referenced above is based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Actual daily dose in mice was up to 5000 mg/kg/day in food. Hyperplasia of the biliary tract and cholangioma and adenocarcinoma of the intrahepatic biliary system have been reported in one strain of rats after dietary administration of doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose for 22 months. Hyperplastic, but not neoplastic, lesions were reported at lower doses. Subsequent long-term dietary administration studies in a different strain of rat, each with an exposure level equal to the maximum level employed in the earlier experiment, have failed to show such hyperplastic/neoplastic changes in the liver. Mutagenesis Tranexamic acid was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in the in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames test), in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster cells, and in in vivo chromosome aberration tests in mice and rats. Impairment of Fertility Reproductive studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits have not revealed any evidence of impaired fertility or adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Ocular Effects In a 9-month toxicology study, dogs were administered tranexamic acid in food at doses of 0, 200, 600, or 1200 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 2, 5, and 6 times, respectively, the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on AUC. At 6 times the human dose, some dogs developed reversible reddening and gelatinous discharge from the eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed reversible changes in the nictitating membrane/conjunctiva. In some female dogs, the presence of inflammatory exudate over the bulbar conjunctival mucosa was observed. Histopathological examinations did not reveal any retinal alteration. No adverse effects were observed at 5 times the human dose. In other studies, focal areas of retinal degeneration were observed in cats, dogs and rats following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid doses at 6 to 40 times the recommended usual human dose based on mg/m 2 (actual animal doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of the Clinical Studies The efficacy of tranexamic acid tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women of reproductive potential was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: one 3-cycle treatment study (Study 1) and one 6-cycle treatment study (Study 2) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In these studies, HMB was defined as an average menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL as assessed by alkaline hematin analysis of collected sanitary products over two baseline menstrual cycles. Subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21 to 35 days, and a BMI of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had an HMB history of approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. In these studies, the primary outcome measure was menstrual blood loss (MBL), measured using the alkaline hematin method. The endpoint was change from baseline in MBL, calculated by subtracting the mean MBL during treatment from the mean pretreatment MBL. The key secondary outcome measures were based on specific questions concerning limitations in social or leisure activities (LSLA) and limitations in physical activities (LPA). Large stains (soiling beyond the undergarment) were also included as a key secondary outcome measure. 14.2 Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in the Three-Cycle Treatment Study Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo on MBL over a 3-cycle treatment duration. Of the 294 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 1950 mg/day, 112 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg/day and 67 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 4. Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. The 1950 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets dose did not meet the criteria for success. Table 4.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.1 ) Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration: FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic Acid Injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with Tranexamic Acid Injection. Avoid concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid Injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. 5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic Acid Injection is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrhythmias have occurred when Tranexamic Acid Injection was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously. Confirm the correct route of administration for Tranexamic Acid Injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as Tranexamic Acid Injection. Syringes containing Tranexamic Acid Injection should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration. 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic Acid Injection may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which Tranexamic Acid Injection is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic Acid Injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid Injection if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic Acid Injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic Acid Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid Injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic Acid Injection may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how Tranexamic Acid Injection affects them."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Thromboembolic Risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Visual Disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Dizziness [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Most common adverse reactions are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic dermatitis, giddiness, hypotension, and thromboembolic events. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact XGen Pharmaceuticals DJB, Inc, at 1-866-390-4411 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data ). Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic Acid Injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic Acid Injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic Acid Injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic Acid Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tranexamic Acid Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid Injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of Tranexamic Acid Injection in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Tranexamic Acid Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of Tranexamic Acid Injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient's serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic Acid Injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic Acid Injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic Acid Injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits."

      "Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data ). Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 - 2.8, 2.8 - 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ].

Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.1 ) Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration: FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid injection. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . 5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrhythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid injection. Syringes containing tranexamic acid injection should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration. 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid injection may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid injection is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid injection may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid injection affects them."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid injection for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data ) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2\u20134% and 15\u201320%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid ; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22\u201336 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid , which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid injection in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient's serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid injection and other drugs have been conducted."

Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. (5.2) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid is for intravenous use only. Serious, including fatal, adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid was inadvertently administered via the neuraxial route. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid. Clearly label syringes containing tranexamic acid with the intravenous route of administration. 5.2 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid via the neuraxial route). Tranexamic acid is contraindicated for neuraxial administration (i.e., epidural, intrathecal). Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid affects them."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, chromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation Day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid and other drugs have been conducted."

Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid and other drugs have been conducted."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

Tranexamic acid injection can be administered undiluted or as a diluted solution. Use aseptic technique to prepare tranexamic acid injection. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Tranexamic acid injection is a clear and colorless solution. Discard the vial if particulate matter is observed. Calculate the dose (mg) based on the patients actual body weight and the total volume (mL) of tranexamic acid injection solution required. If diluting tranexamic acid injection, follow the instructions below: From the diluent infusion bag, withdraw a volume equal to the volume of the tranexamic acid injection solution required for the patients dose. Withdraw the required volume of tranexamic acid injection solution from the vial and dilute with a compatible diluent (see below) to make a final concentration of 10 mg/mL or 20 mg/mL. Discard any unused portion left in the vial. For intravenous infusion, tranexamic acid injection may be mixed with most solutions for infusion such as electrolyte solutions, carbohydrate solutions, amino acid solutions, and Dextran solutions. Heparin may be added to tranexamic acid injection Tranexamic acid injection should NOT be mixed with blood. The drug is a synthetic amino acid and should NOT be mixed with solutions containing penicillin. Gently invert the infusion bag to mix the diluted solution. DO NOT SHAKE. If not used immediately, store the diluted tranexamic acid injection infusion solution at room temperature 20\u00baC to 25\u00b0C (68\u00baF to 77\u00b0F) for up to 4 hours.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5. 2) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious, including fatal, adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered via the neuraxial route. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid injection. Clearly label syringes containing tranexamic acid injection with the intravenous route of administration. 5.2 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid injection. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.3)] . 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid injection may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid via the neuraxial route). Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated for neuraxial administration (i.e., epidural, intrathecal). Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1,600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid injection may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid injection affects them."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion,chromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation Day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5. 2), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid injection in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient's serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid and other drugs have been conducted."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious, including fatal, adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered via the neuraxial route. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid injection. Clearly label syringes containing tranexamic acid injection with the intravenous route of administration. 5.2 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid via the neuraxial route). Tranexamic acid is contraindicated for neuraxial administration (i.e., epidural, intrathecal). Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid affects them."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gland Pharma at 864-879-994 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, chromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation Day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .

Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration: FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with Tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of Tranexamic acid and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . 5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when Tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously. Confirm the correct route of administration for Tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as Tranexamic acid injection. Syringes containing Tranexamic acid injection should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration. 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which Tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue Tranexamic acid if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic acid if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue Tranexamic acid if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how Tranexamic acid affects them."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Caplin Steriles Limited at 1-866-978-6111 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration ( see Data ). Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively ( see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic acid during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic acid administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tranexamic acid; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tranexamic acid and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tranexamic acid or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of Tranexamic acid, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of Tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of Tranexamic acid in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between Tranexamic acid and other drugs have been conducted."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolism, including retinal occlusion, has been reported with tranexamic acid tablets use. Concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives, Factor IX complex concentrates, anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates or all-trans retinoic acid (oral tretinoin) may increase the risk of thrombosis. ( 5.1 ) Visual or ocular adverse reactions may occur with tranexamic acid tablets. Immediately discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) In case of severe allergic reaction, discontinue tranexamic acid tablets and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.2 ) Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. ( 5.3 ) Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism, as well as cases of retinal artery and retinal vein occlusions, have been reported with tranexamic acid tablets. Retinal venous and arterial occlusion have been reported in patients using tranexamic acid tablets. Patients should be instructed to report visual and ocular symptoms promptly. In the event of such symptoms, patients should be instructed to discontinue tranexamic acid tablets immediately and should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including dilated retinal examination, to exclude the possibility of retinal venous or arterial occlusion. Concomitant Use of Hormonal Contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Because tranexamic acid tablets are antifibrinolytic, the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke, may increase further when combined hormonal contraceptives are administered with tranexamic acid tablets. This is of particular concern in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes, especially smokers over 35 years of age. Women using combined hormonal contraception were excluded from the clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid tablets, and there are no clinical trial data on the risk of thrombotic events with the concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives. However, there have been US postmarketing reports of venous and arterial thrombotic events in women who have used tranexamic acid tablets concomitantly with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Concomitant Use with Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets is not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Taking Concomitant All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.2 Severe Allergic Reactions A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid tablets was reported in the clinical trials, involving a subject who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. A case of anaphylactic shock has also been reported in the literature, involving a patient who received an intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid tablets are contraindicated in females of reproductive potential with known hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. 5.4 Ligneous Conjunctivitis Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. The conjunctivitis resolved following cessation of tranexamic acid tablets."

Adverse Reactions in Short-term Studies The safety of tranexamic acid tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in females of reproductive potential was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo over a 3-cycle treatment duration. A total of 304 women were randomized to this study, with 115 receiving at least one dose of 3900 mg/day of tranexamic acid tablets. Study 2 compared the effects of tranexamic acid tablets (3900 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6-cycle treatment duration. A total of 196 women were randomized to this study, with 117 receiving at least one dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Across the studies, the combined exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 947 cycles and the average duration of use was 3.4 days per cycle. In both studies, subjects were generally healthy women who had menstrual blood loss of \u226580 mL. In these studies, subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21 to 35 days, and a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the trials. A list of adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid tablets-treated subjects receiving 3900 mg/day compared to placebo-treated subjects is provided in Table 2. Table 2.

In one study, subjects with physician-diagnosed heavy menstrual bleeding (not using the alkaline hematin methodology) were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 781 subjects were enrolled and 239 completed the study through 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 12.4% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the study. The total exposure in this study to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 10,213 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablets use was 2.9 days per cycle. A long-term open-label extension study of subjects from the two short-term efficacy studies was also conducted in which subjects were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 288 subjects were enrolled and 196 subjects completed the study through 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 2.1% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. The total exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets in this study was 1,956 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablets use was 3.5 days per cycle. The types and severity of adverse reactions in these two long-term open-label trials were similar to those observed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies although the percentage of subjects reporting them was greater in the 27-month study, most likely because of the longer study duration. A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid tablets was reported in the extension trial, involving a subject on her fourth cycle of treatment, who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders: Impaired color vision and other visual disturbances Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Immune system disorders: Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reactions Nervous system disorders: Dizziness Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Allergic skin reactions Vascular disorders: Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery and vein obstruction); cases have been associated with concomitant use of combined hormonal contraceptives"

Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid tablets and tissue plasminogen activators. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Because tranexamic acid tablets are antifibrinolytic, concomitant use of combined hormonal contraception and tranexamic acid tablets may increase the thrombotic risk associated with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.2 Tissue Plasminogen Activators Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid tablets and tissue plasminogen activators. Discontinue tranexamic acid tablets if a patient requires tissue plasminogen activators. 7.3 Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 7.4 All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

There are no available data on tranexamic acid tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. Animal reproduction studies have not identified adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tranexamic acid to pregnant rats at doses up to 4 times the recommended human dose (see Data) . In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, tranexamic acid had no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when administered during the period of organogenesis (from gestation days 6 through 17) at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg (1, 2 and 4 times the recommended human oral dosage of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 )). In a perinatal-postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats administered tranexamic acid from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg, no significant adverse effects on maternal behavior or body weight were observed, and no significant effects on pup viability, body weight, developmental milestones or adult fertility were observed. It was concluded that the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1500 mg/kg/day in both F 0 and F 1 generations, which is equivalent to 4 times the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tranexamic acid is present in the mother\u2019s milk at a concentration of about one hundredth of the corresponding serum concentration (see Data). The amount of tranexamic acid a nursing infant would absorb is unknown. There are no adequate data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects of tranexamic acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from tranexamic acid tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Human Data One hour after the last dose following a 2-day treatment course in lactating women, the milk concentration of the tranexamic acid was 1% of the peak serum concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of tranexamic acid tablets have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for those 17 years and older. Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated before menarche. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive potential and are not intended for use by postmenopausal women. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid tablets has not been studied. Because tranexamic acid is primarily eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration with more than 95% excreted as unchanged in urine, the recommended dosage in patients with renal impairment is lower than the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid tablets has not been studied. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u00b5mol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u00b5mol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, at in vitro concentrations of 25 to 100 \u03bcM, reduces by 20 to 60% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving tranexamic acid total oral doses of 2 to 3 g/day for 5 days. In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid tablets on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid tablets 1300 mg, (2) tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid tablets, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid tablets in women aged 18 to 49 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid tablets for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5 th dose of tranexamic acid tablets on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid tablets are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2022h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 a (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2022h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) b 2.5 (1 to 5) 2.5 (2 to 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life a AUC 0-tau (mcg\u2022h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours b Data presented as median (range) Effect of food : Tranexamic acid tablets may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110 to 116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 to 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 to 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of Tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid tablets. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2022h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 a (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2022h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) b 2.5 (1 to 5) 2.5 (2 to 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life a AUC 0-tau (mcg\u2022h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours b Data presented as median (range) Effect of food : Tranexamic acid tablets may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110 to 116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 to 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 to 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of Tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid tablets. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies with tranexamic acid in male mice at doses as high as 6 times the recommended human dose of 3900 mg/day showed an increased incidence of leukemia which may have been related to treatment. Female mice were not included in this experiment. The dose multiple referenced above is based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Actual daily dose in mice was up to 5000 mg/kg/day in food. Hyperplasia of the biliary tract and cholangioma and adenocarcinoma of the intrahepatic biliary system have been reported in one strain of rats after dietary administration of doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose for 22 months. Hyperplastic, but not neoplastic, lesions were reported at lower doses. Subsequent long-term dietary administration studies in a different strain of rat, each with an exposure level equal to the maximum level employed in the earlier experiment, have failed to show such hyperplastic/neoplastic changes in the liver. Mutagenesis Tranexamic acid was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in the in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames test), in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster cells, and in in vivo chromosome aberration tests in mice and rats. Impairment of Fertility Reproductive studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits have not revealed any evidence of impaired fertility or adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Ocular Effects In a 9-month toxicology study, dogs were administered tranexamic acid in food at doses of 0, 200, 600, or 1200 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 2, 5, and 6 times, respectively, the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on AUC. At 6 times the human dose, some dogs developed reversible reddening and gelatinous discharge from the eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed reversible changes in the nictitating membrane/conjunctiva. In some female dogs, the presence of inflammatory exudate over the bulbar conjunctival mucosa was observed. Histopathological examinations did not reveal any retinal alteration. No adverse effects were observed at 5 times the human dose. In other studies, focal areas of retinal degeneration were observed in cats, dogs and rats following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid doses at 6 to 40 times the recommended usual human dose based on mg/m 2 (actual animal doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of the Clinical Studies The efficacy of tranexamic acid tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women of reproductive potential was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: one 3-cycle treatment study (Study 1) and one 6-cycle treatment study (Study 2) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In these studies, HMB was defined as an average menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL as assessed by alkaline hematin analysis of collected sanitary products over two baseline menstrual cycles. Subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21 to 35 days, and a BMI of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had an HMB history of approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. In these studies, the primary outcome measure was menstrual blood loss (MBL), measured using the alkaline hematin method. The endpoint was change from baseline in MBL, calculated by subtracting the mean MBL during treatment from the mean pretreatment MBL. The key secondary outcome measures were based on specific questions concerning limitations in social or leisure activities (LSLA) and limitations in physical activities (LPA). Large stains (soiling beyond the undergarment) were also included as a key secondary outcome measure. 14.2 Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in the Three-Cycle Treatment Study Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo on MBL over a 3-cycle treatment duration. Of the 294 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 1950 mg/day, 112 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg/day and 67 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 4. Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. The 1950 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets dose did not meet the criteria for success. Table 4.

Of the 187 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets and 72 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 6. MBL was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. Table 6.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Thromboembolism, including retinal occlusion, has been reported with tranexamic acid tablets use. Concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives, Factor IX complex concentrates, anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates or all-trans retinoic acid (oral tretinoin) may increase the risk of thrombosis. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Visual or ocular adverse reactions may occur with tranexamic acid tablets. Immediately discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 In case of severe allergic reaction, discontinue tranexamic acid tablets and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking Tranexamic acid tablets. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism, as well as cases of retinal artery and retinal vein occlusions, have been reported with tranexamic acid tablets. Retinal venous and arterial occlusion have been reported in patients using tranexamic acid tablets. Patients should be instructed to report visual and ocular symptoms promptly. In the event of such symptoms, patients should be instructed to discontinue tranexamic acid tablets immediately and should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including dilated retinal examination, to exclude the possibility of retinal venous or arterial occlusion. Concomitant Use of Hormonal Contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Because tranexamic acid tablets are antifibrinolytic, the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke, may increase further when combined hormonal contraceptives are administered with tranexamic acid tablets. This is of particular concern in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes, especially smokers over 35 years of age. Women using combined hormonal contraception were excluded from the clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid tablets, and there are no clinical trial data on the risk of thrombotic events with the concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives. However, there have been US postmarketing reports of venous and arterial thrombotic events in women who have used tranexamic acid tablets concomitantly with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Concomitant Use with Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Taking Concomitant All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.2 Severe Allergic Reactions A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid tablets was reported in the clinical trials, involving a subject who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. A case of anaphylactic shock has also been reported in the literature, involving a patient who received an intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid tablets are contraindicated in females of reproductive potential with known hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. 5.4 Ligneous Conjunctivitis Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid tablets. The conjunctivitis resolved following cessation of tranexamic acid tablets."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (\u2265 5%, and more frequent in tranexamic acid tablets-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects) are headache, sinus and nasal symptoms, back pain, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, joint pain, muscle cramps, migraine, anemia and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Advagen Pharma Ltd. at 866-488-0312 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adverse Reactions in Short-term Studies The safety of tranexamic acid tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in females of reproductive potential was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ]. \u2022 Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo over a 3-cycle treatment duration. A total of 304 women were randomized to this study, with 115 receiving at least one dose of 3900 mg/day of tranexamic acid tablets. \u2022 Study 2 compared the effects of tranexamic acid tablets (3900 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6-cycle treatment duration. A total of 196 women were randomized to this study, with 117 receiving at least one dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Across the studies, the combined exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 947 cycles and the average duration of use was 3.4 days per cycle. In both studies, subjects were generally healthy women who had menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL. In these studies, subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21-35 days, and a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the trials. A list of adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid tablets-treated subjects receiving 3900 mg/day compared to placebo-treated subjects is provided in Table 2. Table 2. Adverse Reactions* Reported in Women with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (Studies 1 and 2) Tranexamic Acid Tablets 3900 mg/day n (%) (N=232) Placebo n(%) (N=139) Number of Subjects with at Least One Adverse Reaction 208 (89.7%) 122 (87.8%) Headache a 117 (50.4%) 65 (46.8%) Nasal & sinus symptoms b 59 (25.4%) 24 (17.3%) Back pain 48 (20.7%) 21 (15.1%) Abdominal pain c 46 (19.8%) 25 (18.0%) Musculoskeletal pain d 26 (11.2%) 4 (2.9%) Arthralgia e 16 (6.9%) 7 (5.0%) Muscle cramps & spasms 15 (6.5%) 8 (5.8%) Migraine 14 (6.0%) 8 (5.8%) Anemia 13 (5.6%) 5 (3.6%) Fatigue 12 (5.2%) 6 (4.3%) * Adverse reactions that were reported by \u2265 5% of tranexamic acid tablets -treated subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid tablets -treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects a Includes headache and tension headache b Nasal and sinus symptoms include nasal, respiratory tract and sinus congestion, sinusitis, acute sinusitis, sinus headache, allergic sinusitis and sinus pain, and multiple allergies and seasonal allergies c Abdominal pain includes abdominal tenderness and discomfort d Musculoskeletal pain includes musculoskeletal discomfort and myalgia e Arthralgia includes joint stiffness and swelling Adverse Reactions in Long-term Studies Long-term safety of tranexamic acid tablets was studied in two open-label studies. In one study, subjects with physician-diagnosed heavy menstrual bleeding (not using the alkaline hematin methodology) were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 781 subjects were enrolled and 239 completed the study through 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 12.4% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the study. The total exposure in this study to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 10,213 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablets use was 2.9 days per cycle. A long-term open-label extension study of subjects from the two short-term efficacy studies was also conducted in which subjects were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 288 subjects were enrolled and 196 subjects completed the study through 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 2.1% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. The total exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets in this study was 1,956 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablets use was 3.5 days per cycle. The types and severity of adverse reactions in these two long-term open-label trials were similar to those observed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies although the percentage of subjects reporting them was greater in the 27-month study, most likely because of the longer study duration. A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid tablets was reported in the extension trial, involving a subject on her fourth cycle of treatment, who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with tranexamic acid tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Eye disorders: Impaired color vision and other visual disturbances \u2022 Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea \u2022 Immune system disorders: Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reactions \u2022 Nervous system disorders: Dizziness \u2022 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Allergic skin reactions \u2022 Vascular disorders: Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery and vein obstruction); cases have been associated with concomitant use of combined hormonal contraceptives"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Geriatric use: Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated for use in postmenopausal women ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal impairment: A lower dosage is needed. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is needed. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated for use in pregnant women . There are no available data on tranexamic acid tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. Animal reproduction studies have not identified adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tranexamic acid to pregnant rats at doses up to 4 times the recommended human dose (see Data ) . In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, tranexamic acid had no adverse effects on embryo- fetal development when administered during the period of organogenesis (from gestation days 6 through 17) at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg (1, 2 and 4 times the recommended human oral dosage of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). In a perinatal-postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats administered tranexamic acid from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg, no significant adverse effects on maternal behavior or body weight were observed, and no significant effects on pup viability, body weight, developmental milestones or adult fertility were observed. It was concluded that the no- observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1500 mg/kg/day in both F 0 and F 1 generations, which is equivalent to 4 times the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tranexamic acid is present in the mother\u2019s milk at a concentration of about one hundredth of the corresponding serum concentration (see Data ). The amount of tranexamic acid a nursing infant would absorb is unknown. There are no adequate data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects of tranexamic acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from tranexamic acid tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data HumanData One hour after the last dose following a 2-day treatment course in lactating women, the milk concentration of the tranexamic acid was 1% of the peak serum concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of tranexamic acid tablets have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for those 17 years and older. Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated before menarche. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive potential and is not intended for use by postmenopausal women. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid tablets has not been studied. Because tranexamic acid is primarily eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration with more than 95% excreted as unchanged in urine, the recommended dosage in patient with renal impairment is lower than the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid tablets has not been studied. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u00b5mol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u00b5mol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, at in vitro concentrations of 25 - 100 \u00b5M, reduces by 20 - 60% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving tranexamic acid tablets total oral doses of 2-3 g/day for 5 days. In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid tablets on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid tablets 1300 mg (2) tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid tablets, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid tablets in women aged 18-49 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid tablets for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5 th dose of tranexamic acid tablets on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid tablets are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2219h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 a (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2219h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) b 2.5 (1 \u2013 5) 2.5 (2 \u2013 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life a AUC 0-tau (mcg\u00b7h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours b Data presented as median (range) Effect of food : Tranexamic acid tablets may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110-116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 \u2013 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 \u2013 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study. [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of Tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid tablets. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies with tranexamic acid in male mice at doses as high as 6 times the recommended human dose of 3900 mg/day showed an increased incidence of leukemia which may have been related to treatment. Female mice were not included in this experiment. The dose multiple referenced above is based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Actual daily dose in mice was up to 5000 mg/kg/day in food. Hyperplasia of the biliary tract and cholangioma and adenocarcinoma of the intrahepatic biliary system have been reported in one strain of rats after dietary administration of doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose for 22 months. Hyperplastic, but not neoplastic, lesions were reported at lower doses. Subsequent long-term dietary administration studies in a different strain of rat, each with an exposure level equal to the maximum level employed in the earlier experiment, have failed to show such hyperplastic/neoplastic changes in the liver. Mutagenesis Tranexamic acid was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in the in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames test), in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster cells, and in in vivo chromosome aberration tests in mice and rats. Impairment of Fertility Reproductive studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits have not revealed any evidence of impaired fertility or adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Ocular Effects In a 9-month toxicology study, dogs were administered tranexamic acid in food at doses of 0, 200, 600, or 1200 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 2, 5, and 6 times, respectively, the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on AUC. At 6 times the human dose, some dogs developed reversible reddening and gelatinous discharge from the eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed reversible changes in the nictitating membrane/conjunctiva. In some female dogs, the presence of inflammatory exudate over the bulbar conjunctival mucosa was observed. Histopathological examinations did not reveal any retinal alteration. No adverse effects were observed at 5 times the human dose. In other studies, focal areas of retinal degeneration were observed in cats, dogs and rats following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid doses at 6-40 times the recommended usual human dose based on mg/m 2 (actual animal doses between 250-1600 mg/kg/day)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of the Clinical Studies The efficacy of tranexamic acid tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women of reproductive potential was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: one 3-cycle treatment study (Study 1) and one 6-cycle treatment study (Study 2) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. In these studies, HMB was defined as an average menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL as assessed by alkaline hematin analysis of collected sanitary products over two baseline menstrual cycles. Subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21-35 days, and a BMI of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had an HMB history of approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. In these studies, the primary outcome measure was menstrual blood loss (MBL), measured using the alkaline hematin method. The endpoint was change from baseline in MBL, calculated by subtracting the mean MBL during treatment from the mean pretreatment MBL. The key secondary outcome measures were based on specific questions concerning limitations in social or leisure activities (LSLA) and limitations in physical activities (LPA). Large stains (soiling beyond the undergarment) were also included as a key secondary outcome measure. 14.2 Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in the Three-Cycle Treatment Study Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo on MBL over a 3-cycle treatment duration. Of the 294 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 1950 mg/day, 112 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg/day and 67 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post- treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 4. Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. The 1950 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets dose did not meet the criteria for success. Table 4.

Of the 187 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets and 72 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 6. MBL was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. Table 6.

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Tranexamic Acid Tablets, for oral use Read the Patient Information that comes with tranexamic acid tablets before you start using the drug and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. What are tranexamic acid tablets? Tranexamic acid tablets are a prescription medicine used to treat your heavy monthly period (menstruation) when your bleeding gets in the way of social, leisure and physical activities. Tranexamic acid tablets do not contain any hormones. On average, tranexamic acid tablets have been shown to lower the amount of blood lost during your monthly period by about one-third, but it is not meant to stop your period. Tranexamic acid tablets are taken only during your period and is not meant to treat pre-menstrual symptoms (symptoms that occur before your bleeding starts). Tranexamic acid tablets do not affect your fertility and cannot be used as birth control. Tranexamic acid tablets do not protect you against diseases that you may get if you have unprotected sex. Tranexamic acid tablets have not been studied in adolescents younger than 18 years of age. Tranexamic acid tablets are not for women who have already gone through menopause (post-menopausal). Who should not take Tranexamic acid tablets? Do not take Tranexamic acid tablets if you: \u2022 Are using a form of birth control that contains estrogen and a progestin (like a birth control pill, patch, or vaginal ring). Ask your healthcare provider before taking tranexamic acid tablets if you are not sure if your birth control method contains estrogen and a progestin. \u2022 Currently have a blood clot \u2022 Have ever had a blood clot \u2022 Have been told that you are at risk of having a blood clot \u2022 Are allergic to tranexamic acid tablets or tranexamic acid What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking tranexamic acid tablets? Before taking tranexamic acid tablets, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including whether: \u2022 You have ever had a blood clot or been told that you are at risk of having a blood clot \u2022 You are using a form of birth control that contains estrogen and a progestin (like a birth control pill, patch, or vaginal ring). Using hormonal birth control along with tranexamic acid tablets may increase your chance of having a serious blood clot, stroke, or heart attack.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolism, including retinal occlusion, has been reported with tranexamic acid tablets use. Concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives, Factor IX complex concentrates, anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates or all-trans retinoic acid (oral tretinoin) may increase the risk of thrombosis. ( 5.1 ) Visual or ocular adverse reactions may occur with tranexamic acid tablets. Immediately discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) In case of severe allergic reaction, discontinue tranexamic acid tablets and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.2 ) Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. ( 5.3 ) Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism, as well as cases of retinal artery and retinal vein occlusions, have been reported with tranexamic acid tablets. Retinal venous and arterial occlusion have been reported in patients using tranexamic acid tablets. Patients should be instructed to report visual and ocular symptoms promptly. In the event of such symptoms, patients should be instructed to discontinue tranexamic acid tablets immediately and should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including dilated retinal examination, to exclude the possibility of retinal venous or arterial occlusion. Concomitant Use of Hormonal Contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Because tranexamic acid tablets are antifibrinolytic, the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke, may increase further when combined hormonal contraceptives are administered with tranexamic acid tablets. This is of particular concern in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes, especially smokers over 35 years of age. Women using combined hormonal contraception were excluded from the clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid tablets, and there are no clinical trial data on the risk of thrombotic events with the concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives. However, there have been US postmarketing reports of venous and arterial thrombotic events in women who have used tranexamic acid tablets concomitantly with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Concomitant Use with Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets is not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Taking Concomitant All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.2 Severe Allergic Reactions A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid tablets was reported in the clinical trials, involving a subject who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. A case of anaphylactic shock has also been reported in the literature, involving a patient who received an intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid tablets are contraindicated in females of reproductive potential with known hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. 5.4 Ligneous Conjunctivitis Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. The conjunctivitis resolved following cessation of tranexamic acid tablets."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (\u2265 5%, and more frequent in tranexamic acid tablets-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects) are headache, sinus and nasal symptoms, back pain, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, joint pain, muscle cramps, migraine, anemia and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adverse Reactions in Short-term Studies The safety of tranexamic acid tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in females of reproductive potential was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo over a 3-cycle treatment duration. A total of 304 women were randomized to this study, with 115 receiving at least one dose of 3900 mg/day of tranexamic acid tablets. Study 2 compared the effects of tranexamic acid tablets (3900 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6-cycle treatment duration. A total of 196 women were randomized to this study, with 117 receiving at least one dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Across the studies, the combined exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 947 cycles and the average duration of use was 3.4 days per cycle. In both studies, subjects were generally healthy women who had menstrual blood loss of \u226580 mL. In these studies, subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21 to 35 days, and a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the trials. A list of adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid tablets-treated subjects receiving 3900 mg/day compared to placebo-treated subjects is provided in Table 2. Table 2. Adverse Reactions* Reported in Women with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (Studies 1 and 2) Tranexamic Acid Tablets 3900 mg/day n (%) (N=232) Placebo n (%) (N=139) Number of Subjects with at Least One Adverse Reaction 208 (89.7%) 122 (87.8%) Headache a 117 (50.4%) 65 (46.8%) Nasal & sinus symptoms b 59 (25.4%) 24 (17.3%) Back pain 48 (20.7%) 21 (15.1%) Abdominal pain c 46 (19.8%) 25 (18.0%) Musculoskeletal pain d 26 (11.2%) 4 (2.9%) Arthralgia e 16 (6.9%) 7 (5.0%) Muscle cramps & spasms 15 (6.5%) 8 (5.8%) Migraine 14 (6.0%) 8 (5.8%) Anemia 13 (5.6%) 5 (3.6%) Fatigue 12 (5.2%) 6 (4.3%) * Adverse reactions that were reported by \u2265 5% of tranexamic acid tablets-treated subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid tablets-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects a Includes headache and tension headache b Nasal and sinus symptoms include nasal, respiratory tract and sinus congestion, sinusitis, acute sinusitis, sinus headache, allergic sinusitis and sinus pain, and multiple allergies and seasonal allergies c Abdominal pain includes abdominal tenderness and discomfort d Musculoskeletal pain includes musculoskeletal discomfort and myalgia e Arthralgia includes joint stiffness and swelling Adverse Reactions in Long-term Studies Long-term safety of tranexamic acid tablets was studied in two open-label studies. In one study, subjects with physician-diagnosed heavy menstrual bleeding (not using the alkaline hematin methodology) were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 781 subjects were enrolled and 239 completed the study through 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 12.4% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the study. The total exposure in this study to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 10,213 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablets use was 2.9 days per cycle. A long-term open-label extension study of subjects from the two short-term efficacy studies was also conducted in which subjects were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 288 subjects were enrolled and 196 subjects completed the study through 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 2.1% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. The total exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets in this study was 1,956 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablets use was 3.5 days per cycle. The types and severity of adverse reactions in these two long-term open-label trials were similar to those observed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies although the percentage of subjects reporting them was greater in the 27-month study, most likely because of the longer study duration. A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid tablets was reported in the extension trial, involving a subject on her fourth cycle of treatment, who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders: Impaired color vision and other visual disturbances Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Immune system disorders: Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reactions Nervous system disorders: Dizziness Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Allergic skin reactions Vascular disorders: Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery and vein obstruction); cases have been associated with concomitant use of combined hormonal contraceptives"

Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid tablets and tissue plasminogen activators. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Because tranexamic acid tablets are antifibrinolytic, concomitant use of combined hormonal contraception and tranexamic acid tablets may increase the thrombotic risk associated with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.2 Tissue Plasminogen Activators Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid tablets and tissue plasminogen activators. Discontinue tranexamic acid tablets if a patient requires tissue plasminogen activators. 7.3 Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 7.4 All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric use: Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated for use in postmenopausal women ( 8.5 ) Renal impairment: Dosage adjustment is needed. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) Hepatic impairment: A lower dosage is needed. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated for use in pregnant women . There are no available data on tranexamic acid tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. Animal reproduction studies have not identified adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tranexamic acid to pregnant rats at doses up to 4 times the recommended human dose (see Data) . In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, tranexamic acid had no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when administered during the period of organogenesis (from gestation days 6 through 17) at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg (1, 2 and 4 times the recommended human oral dosage of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 )). In a perinatal-postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats administered tranexamic acid from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg, no significant adverse effects on maternal behavior or body weight were observed, and no significant effects on pup viability, body weight, developmental milestones or adult fertility were observed. It was concluded that the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1500 mg/kg/day in both F 0 and F 1 generations, which is equivalent to 4 times the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tranexamic acid is present in the mother\u2019s milk at a concentration of about one hundredth of the corresponding serum concentration (see Data). The amount of tranexamic acid a nursing infant would absorb is unknown. There are no adequate data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects of tranexamic acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from tranexamic acid tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Human Data One hour after the last dose following a 2-day treatment course in lactating women, the milk concentration of the tranexamic acid was 1% of the peak serum concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of tranexamic acid tablets have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for those 17 years and older. Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated before menarche. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive potential and are not intended for use by postmenopausal women. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid tablets has not been studied. Because tranexamic acid is primarily eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration with more than 95% excreted as unchanged in urine, the recommended dosage in patients with renal impairment is lower than the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid tablets has not been studied. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u00b5mol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u00b5mol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, at in vitro concentrations of 25 to 100 \u03bcM, reduces by 20 to 60% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving tranexamic acid total oral doses of 2 to 3 g/day for 5 days. In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid tablets on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid tablets 1300 mg, (2) tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid tablets, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid tablets in women aged 18 to 49 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid tablets for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5 th dose of tranexamic acid tablets on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid tablets are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2022h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 a (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2022h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) b 2.5 (1 to 5) 2.5 (2 to 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life a AUC 0-tau (mcg\u2022h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours b Data presented as median (range) Effect of food : Tranexamic acid tablets may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110 to 116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 to 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 to 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of Tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid tablets. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u00b5mol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u00b5mol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, at in vitro concentrations of 25 to 100 \u03bcM, reduces by 20 to 60% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving tranexamic acid total oral doses of 2 to 3 g/day for 5 days. In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid tablets on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid tablets 1300 mg, (2) tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid tablets, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid tablets in women aged 18 to 49 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid tablets for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5 th dose of tranexamic acid tablets on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid tablets are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2022h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 a (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2022h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) b 2.5 (1 to 5) 2.5 (2 to 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life a AUC 0-tau (mcg\u2022h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours b Data presented as median (range) Effect of food : Tranexamic acid tablets may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110 to 116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 to 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 to 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of Tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid tablets. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

Female mice were not included in this experiment. The dose multiple referenced above is based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Actual daily dose in mice was up to 5000 mg/kg/day in food. Hyperplasia of the biliary tract and cholangioma and adenocarcinoma of the intrahepatic biliary system have been reported in one strain of rats after dietary administration of doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose for 22 months. Hyperplastic, but not neoplastic, lesions were reported at lower doses. Subsequent long-term dietary administration studies in a different strain of rat, each with an exposure level equal to the maximum level employed in the earlier experiment, have failed to show such hyperplastic/neoplastic changes in the liver. Mutagenesis Tranexamic acid was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in the in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames test), in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster cells, and in in vivo chromosome aberration tests in mice and rats. Impairment of Fertility Reproductive studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits have not revealed any evidence of impaired fertility or adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Ocular Effects In a 9-month toxicology study, dogs were administered tranexamic acid in food at doses of 0, 200, 600, or 1200 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 2, 5, and 6 times, respectively, the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on AUC. At 6 times the human dose, some dogs developed reversible reddening and gelatinous discharge from the eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed reversible changes in the nictitating membrane/conjunctiva. In some female dogs, the presence of inflammatory exudate over the bulbar conjunctival mucosa was observed. Histopathological examinations did not reveal any retinal alteration. No adverse effects were observed at 5 times the human dose. In other studies, focal areas of retinal degeneration were observed in cats, dogs and rats following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid doses at 6 to 40 times the recommended usual human dose based on mg/m 2 (actual animal doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of the Clinical Studies The efficacy of tranexamic acid tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women of reproductive potential was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: one 3-cycle treatment study (Study 1) and one 6-cycle treatment study (Study 2) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In these studies, HMB was defined as an average menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL as assessed by alkaline hematin analysis of collected sanitary products over two baseline menstrual cycles. Subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21 to 35 days, and a BMI of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had an HMB history of approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. In these studies, the primary outcome measure was menstrual blood loss (MBL), measured using the alkaline hematin method. The endpoint was change from baseline in MBL, calculated by subtracting the mean MBL during treatment from the mean pretreatment MBL. The key secondary outcome measures were based on specific questions concerning limitations in social or leisure activities (LSLA) and limitations in physical activities (LPA). Large stains (soiling beyond the undergarment) were also included as a key secondary outcome measure. 14.2 Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in the Three-Cycle Treatment Study Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo on MBL over a 3-cycle treatment duration. Of the 294 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 1950 mg/day, 112 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg/day and 67 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 4. Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. The 1950 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets dose did not meet the criteria for success. Table 4.

Tranexamic acid injection can be administered undiluted or as a diluted solution. Use aseptic technique to prepare tranexamic acid injection. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Tranexamic acid injection is a clear and colorless solution. Discard the vial if particulate matter is observed. Calculate the dose (mg) based on the patients actual body weight and the total volume (mL) of tranexamic acid injection solution required. If diluting tranexamic acid injection, follow the instructions below: From the diluent infusion bag, withdraw a volume equal to the volume of the tranexamic acid injection solution required for the patients dose. Withdraw the required volume of tranexamic acid injection solution from the vial and dilute with a compatible diluent (see below) to make a final concentration of 10 mg/mL or 20 mg/mL. Discard any unused portion left in the vial. For intravenous infusion, tranexamic acid injection may be mixed with most solutions for infusion such as electrolyte solutions, carbohydrate solutions, amino acid solutions, and Dextran solutions. Heparin may be added to tranexamic acid injection Tranexamic acid injection should NOT be mixed with blood. The drug is a synthetic amino acid and should NOT be mixed with solutions containing penicillin. Gently invert the infusion bag to mix the diluted solution. DO NOT SHAKE.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. (5.2) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. (5.3) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. (5.4) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. (5.5) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. (5.6) 5.1 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious, including fatal, adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered via the neuraxial route. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid injection. Clearly label syringes containing tranexamic acid injection with the intravenous route of administration. 5.2 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid injection. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.3)] . 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid injection may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid via the neuraxial route). Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated for neuraxial administration (i.e., epidural, intrathecal). Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic Acid Injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic Acid Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid injection may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid injection affects them."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Avet Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-866-901-DRUG (3784) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, chromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation Day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid Injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid injection in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between Tranexamic Acid Injection and other drugs have been conducted."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolism, including retinal occlusion, has been reported with tranexamic acid tablets use. Concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives, Factor IX complex concentrates, anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates or all-trans retinoic acid (oral tretinoin) may increase the risk of thrombosis. ( 5.1 ) Visual or ocular adverse reactions may occur with tranexamic acid tablets. Immediately discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) In case of severe allergic reaction, discontinue tranexamic acid tablets and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.2 ) Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. ( 5.3 ) Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking Tranexamic acid tablets. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism, as well as cases of retinal artery and retinal vein occlusions, have been reported with tranexamic acid tablets. Retinal venous and arterial occlusion have been reported in patients using tranexamic acid tablets. Patients should be instructed to report visual and ocular symptoms promptly. In the event of such symptoms, patients should be instructed to discontinue tranexamic acid tablets immediately and should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including dilated retinal examination, to exclude the possibility of retinal venous or arterial occlusion. Concomitant Use of Hormonal Contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Because tranexamic acid tablets are antifibrinolytic, the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke, may increase further when combined hormonal contraceptives are administered with tranexamic acid tablets. This is of particular concern in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes, especially smokers over 35 years of age. Women using combined hormonal contraception were excluded from the clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid tablets, and there are no clinical trial data on the risk of thrombotic events with the concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives. However, there have been US postmarketing reports of venous and arterial thrombotic events in women who have used tranexamic acid tablets concomitantly with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Concomitant Use with Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Taking Concomitant All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.2 Severe Allergic Reactions A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid tablets was reported in the clinical trials, involving a subject who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. A case of anaphylactic shock has also been reported in the literature, involving a patient who received an intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid tablets are contraindicated in females of reproductive potential with known hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. 5.4 Ligneous Conjunctivitis Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid tablets. The conjunctivitis resolved following cessation of tranexamic acid tablets."

Adverse Reactions in Short-term Studies The safety of tranexamic acid tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in females of reproductive potential was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ]. Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo over a 3-cycle treatment duration. A total of 304 women were randomized to this study, with 115 receiving at least one dose of 3900 mg/day of tranexamic acid tablets. Study 2 compared the effects of tranexamic acid tablets (3900 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6-cycle treatment duration. A total of 196 women were randomized to this study, with 117 receiving at least one dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Across the studies, the combined exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 947 cycles and the average duration of use was 3.4 days per cycle. In both studies, subjects were generally healthy women who had menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL. In these studies, subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21-35 days, and a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the trials. A list of adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid tablets-treated subjects receiving 3900 mg/day compared to placebo-treated subjects is provided in Table 2.

In one study, subjects with physician-diagnosed heavy menstrual bleeding (not using the alkaline hematin methodology) were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 781 subjects were enrolled and 239 completed the study through 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 12.4% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the study. The total exposure in this study to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 10,213 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablets use was 2.9 days per cycle. A long-term open-label extension study of subjects from the two short-term efficacy studies was also conducted in which subjects were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 288 subjects were enrolled and 196 subjects completed the study through 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 2.1% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. The total exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets in this study was 1,956 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablets use was 3.5 days per cycle. The types and severity of adverse reactions in these two long-term open-label trials were similar to those observed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies although the percentage of subjects reporting them was greater in the 27-month study, most likely because of the longer study duration. A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid tablets was reported in the extension trial, involving a subject on her fourth cycle of treatment, who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with tranexamic acid tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders: Impaired color vision and other visual disturbances Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Immune system disorders: Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reactions Nervous system disorders: Dizziness Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Allergic skin reactions Vascular disorders: Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery and vein obstruction); cases have been associated with concomitant use of combined hormonal contraceptives"

Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid tablets and tissue plasminogen activators. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Because tranexamic acid tablets are antifibrinolytic, concomitant use of combined hormonal contraception and tranexamic acid tablets may increase the thrombotic risk associated with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.2 Tissue Plasminogen Activators Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid tablets and tissue plasminogen activators. Discontinue tranexamic acid tablets if a patient requires tissue plasminogen activators. 7.3 Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) 7.4 All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric use: Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated for use in postmenopausal women ( 8.5 ) Renal impairment: A lower dosage is needed. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) Hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is needed. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated for use in pregnant women . There are no available data on tranexamic acid tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. Animal reproduction studies have not identified adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tranexamic acid to pregnant rats at doses up to 4 times the recommended human dose (see Data ) . In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, tranexamic acid had no adverse effects on embryo- fetal development when administered during the period of organogenesis (from gestation days 6 through 17) at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg (1, 2 and 4 times the recommended human oral dosage of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). In a perinatal-postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats administered tranexamic acid from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg, no significant adverse effects on maternal behavior or body weight were observed, and no significant effects on pup viability, body weight, developmental milestones or adult fertility were observed. It was concluded that the no- observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1500 mg/kg/day in both F 0 and F 1 generations, which is equivalent to 4 times the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tranexamic acid is present in the mother\u2019s milk at a concentration of about one hundredth of the corresponding serum concentration (see Data ). The amount of tranexamic acid a nursing infant would absorb is unknown. There are no adequate data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects of tranexamic acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from tranexamic acid tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Human Data One hour after the last dose following a 2-day treatment course in lactating women, the milk concentration of the tranexamic acid was 1% of the peak serum concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of tranexamic acid tablets have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for those 17 years and older. Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated before menarche. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive potential and is not intended for use by postmenopausal women. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid tablets has not been studied. Because tranexamic acid is primarily eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration with more than 95% excreted as unchanged in urine, the recommended dosage in patient with renal impairment is lower than the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid tablets has not been studied. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

However, cases of overdose of tranexamic acid have been reported. Based on these reports, symptoms of overdose may include gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea); hypotensive (e.g., orthostatic symptoms); thromboembolic (arterial, venous, embolic); visual impairment; mental status changes; myoclonus; or rash. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with tranexamic acid tablets. In the event of overdose, employ the usual supportive measures (e.g., clinical monitoring and supportive therapy) as dictated by the patient's clinical status."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u00b5mol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u00b5mol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, at in vitro concentrations of 25 - 100 \u00b5M, reduces by 20 - 60% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving tranexamic acid tablets total oral doses of 2-3 g/day for 5 days. In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid tablets on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid tablets 1300 mg (2) tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid tablets, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid tablets in women aged 18-49 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid tablets for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5 th dose of tranexamic acid tablets on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid tablets are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2219h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 a (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2219h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) b 2.5 (1 \u2013 5) 2.5 (2 \u2013 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life a AUC 0-tau (mcg\u00b7h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours b Data presented as median (range) Effect of food : Tranexamic acid tablets may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110-116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 \u2013 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 \u2013 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study. [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of Tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid tablets has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid tablets. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies with tranexamic acid in male mice at doses as high as 6 times the recommended human dose of 3900 mg/day showed an increased incidence of leukemia which may have been related to treatment. Female mice were not included in this experiment. The dose multiple referenced above is based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Actual daily dose in mice was up to 5000 mg/kg/day in food. Hyperplasia of the biliary tract and cholangioma and adenocarcinoma of the intrahepatic biliary system have been reported in one strain of rats after dietary administration of doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose for 22 months. Hyperplastic, but not neoplastic, lesions were reported at lower doses. Subsequent long-term dietary administration studies in a different strain of rat, each with an exposure level equal to the maximum level employed in the earlier experiment, have failed to show such hyperplastic/neoplastic changes in the liver. Mutagenesis Tranexamic acid was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in the in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames test), in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster cells, and in in vivo chromosome aberration tests in mice and rats. Impairment of Fertility Reproductive studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits have not revealed any evidence of impaired fertility or adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Ocular Effects In a 9-month toxicology study, dogs were administered tranexamic acid in food at doses of 0, 200, 600, or 1200 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 2, 5, and 6 times, respectively, the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on AUC. At 6 times the human dose, some dogs developed reversible reddening and gelatinous discharge from the eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed reversible changes in the nictitating membrane/conjunctiva. In some female dogs, the presence of inflammatory exudate over the bulbar conjunctival mucosa was observed. Histopathological examinations did not reveal any retinal alteration. No adverse effects were observed at 5 times the human dose. In other studies, focal areas of retinal degeneration were observed in cats, dogs and rats following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid doses at 6-40 times the recommended usual human dose based on mg/m 2 (actual animal doses between 250-1600 mg/kg/day)."

In these studies, HMB was defined as an average menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL as assessed by alkaline hematin analysis of collected sanitary products over two baseline menstrual cycles. Subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21-35 days, and a BMI of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had an HMB history of approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. In these studies, the primary outcome measure was menstrual blood loss (MBL), measured using the alkaline hematin method. The endpoint was change from baseline in MBL, calculated by subtracting the mean MBL during treatment from the mean pretreatment MBL. The key secondary outcome measures were based on specific questions concerning limitations in social or leisure activities (LSLA) and limitations in physical activities (LPA). Large stains (soiling beyond the undergarment) were also included as a key secondary outcome measure. 14.2 Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in the Three-Cycle Treatment Study Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo on MBL over a 3-cycle treatment duration. Of the 294 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 1950 mg/day, 112 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg/day and 67 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post- treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 4. Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. The 1950 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets dose did not meet the criteria for success. Table 4.

No statistically significant treatment difference was observed in response rates on the number of large stains.

Of the 187 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets and 72 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 6. MBL was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. Table 6.

The change in menstrual bleeding loss from baseline was similar across all post-baseline treatment cycles.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of thrombosis with concomitant use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.1 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.3 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.4 ) Dizziness. Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . 5.2 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection is not FDA approved and which uses doses of up to ten-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection if seizures occur. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.4 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1,600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.5 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection affects them."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat) and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero . Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 g/kg or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adult and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function [ Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours and in the serum, up to seven or eight hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 liters to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 mL/min to 116 mL/min) and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7 and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39 and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection and other drugs have been conducted."

Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 mL/min to 116 mL/min) and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7 and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39 and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection and other drugs have been conducted."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area) and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. (5.1) Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration: FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. (5.2) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. (5.3) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. (5.4) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. (5.5) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs (5.6). 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with Tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of Tranexamic acid and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . 5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when Tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously. Confirm the correct route of administration for Tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as Tranexamic acid injection. Syringes containing Tranexamic acid injection should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration. 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which Tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue Tranexamic acid if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic acid if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue Tranexamic acid if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how Tranexamic acid affects them."

(6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Caplin Steriles Limited at 1-866-978-6111 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic acid during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic acid administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tranexamic acid; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tranexamic acid and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tranexamic acid or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of Tranexamic acid, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of Tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of Tranexamic acid in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic acid during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic acid administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tranexamic acid; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Pharmacology & OR Toxicology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of Thrombosis with concomitant use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention ( 5.3 ). \u2022 Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur ( 5.4 ). \u2022 Dizziness. Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs ( 5.5 ). 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . 5.2 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not FDA approved and which uses doses of up to ten-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if seizures occur. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.4 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.5 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection affects them."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration ( see Data ). Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adult and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient's serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to seven or eight hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] .

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious, including fatal, adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered via the neuraxial route. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid injection. Clearly label syringes containing tranexamic acid injection with the intravenous route of administration . 5.2 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid injection. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3 )] . 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid injection may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid injection is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid via the neuraxial route). Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated for neuraxial administration (i.e., epidural, intrathecal). Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid injection may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid injection affects them."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, chromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data ) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation Day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid injection in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u00b5mol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u00b5mol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid injection and other drugs have been conducted."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u00b5mol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u00b5mol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolism, including retinal occlusion, has been reported with tranexamic acid use. Concomitant use of tranexamic acid with combined hormonal contraceptives, Factor IX complex concentrates, anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates or all-trans retinoic acid (oral tretinoin) may increase the risk of thrombosis. ( 5.1 ) Visual or ocular adverse reactions may occur with tranexamic acid. Immediately discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) In case of severe allergic reaction, discontinue tranexamic acid and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.2 ) Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. ( 5.3 ) Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism, as well as cases of retinal artery and retinal vein occlusions, have been reported with tranexamic acid. Retinal venous and arterial occlusion have been reported in patients using tranexamic acid. Patients should be instructed to report visual and ocular symptoms promptly. In the event of such symptoms, patients should be instructed to discontinue tranexamic acid immediately and should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including dilated retinal examination, to exclude the possibility of retinal venous or arterial occlusion. Concomitant Use of Hormonal Contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Because tranexamic acid is antifibrinolytic, the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke, may increase further when combined hormonal contraceptives are administered with tranexamic acid. This is of particular concern in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes, especially smokers over 35 years of age. Women using combined hormonal contraception were excluded from the clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid, and there are no clinical trial data on the risk of thrombotic events with the concomitant use of tranexamic acid with combined hormonal contraceptives. However, there have been U.S. postmarketing reports of venous and arterial thrombotic events in women who have used tranexamic acid concomitantly with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Concomitant Use with Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid is not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Taking Concomitant All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid is not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.2 Severe Allergic Reactions A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid was reported in the clinical trials, involving a subject who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. A case of anaphylactic shock has also been reported in the literature, involving a patient who received an intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid tablets are contraindicated in females of reproductive potential with known hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. 5.4 Ligneous Conjunctivitis Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. The conjunctivitis resolved following cessation of tranexamic acid."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (\u2265 5%, and more frequent in tranexamic acid-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects) are headache, sinus and nasal symptoms, back pain, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, joint pain, muscle cramps, migraine, anemia and fatigue.

Adverse Reactions in Short-term Studies The safety of tranexamic acid in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in females of reproductive potential was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo over a 3-cycle treatment duration. A total of 304 women were randomized to this study, with 115 receiving at least one dose of 3900 mg/day of tranexamic acid. Study 2 compared the effects of tranexamic acid (3900 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6-cycle treatment duration. A total of 196 women were randomized to this study, with 117 receiving at least one dose of tranexamic acid. Across the studies, the combined exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid was 947 cycles and the average duration of use was 3.4 days per cycle. In both studies, subjects were generally healthy women who had menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL. In these studies, subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21-35 days, and a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the trials. A list of adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid -treated subjects receiving 3900 mg/day compared to placebo-treated subjects is provided in Table 2. Table 2. Adverse Reactions* Reported in Women with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (Studies 1 and 2) * Adverse reactions that were reported by \u2265 5% of tranexamic acid-treated subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects a Includes headache and tension headache b Nasal and sinus symptoms include nasal, respiratory tract and sinus congestion, sinusitis, acute sinusitis, sinus headache, allergic sinusitis and sinus pain, and multiple allergies and seasonal allergies c Abdominal pain includes abdominal tenderness and discomfort d Musculoskeletal pain includes musculoskeletal discomfort and myalgia e Arthralgia includes joint stiffness and swelling Tranexamic Acid 3900 mg/day n (%) (N=232) Placebo n (%) (N=139) Number of Subjects with at Least One Adverse Reaction 208 (89.7%) 122 (87.8%) Headache a 117 (50.4%) 65 (46.8%) Nasal & sinus symptoms b 59 (25.4%) 24 (17.3%) Back pain 48 (20.7%) 21 (15.1%) Abdominal pain c 46 (19.8%) 25 (18%) Musculoskeletal pain d 26 (11.2%) 4 (2.9%) Arthralgia e 16 (6.9%) 7 (5%) Muscle cramps & spasms 15 (6.5%) 8 (5.8%) Migraine 14 (6%) 8 (5.8%) Anemia 13 (5.6%) 5 (3.6%) Fatigue 12 (5.2%) 6 (4.3%) Adverse Reactions in Long-term Studies Long-term safety of tranexamic acid was studied in two open-label studies. In one study, subjects with physician-diagnosed heavy menstrual bleeding (not using the alkaline hematin methodology) were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 781 subjects were enrolled and 239 completed the study through 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 12.4% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the study. The total exposure in this study to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid was 10,213 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid use was 2.9 days per cycle. A long-term open-label extension study of subjects from the two short-term efficacy studies was also conducted in which subjects were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 288 subjects were enrolled and 196 subjects completed the study through 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 2.1% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. The total exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid in this study was 1,956 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid use was 3.5 days per cycle. The types and severity of adverse reactions in these two long-term open-label trials were similar to those observed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies although the percentage of subjects reporting them was greater in the 27-month study, most likely because of the longer study duration. A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid was reported in the extension trial, involving a subject on her fourth cycle of treatment, who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders: Impaired color vision and other visual disturbances Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Immune system disorders: Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reactions Nervous system disorders: Dizziness Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Allergic skin reactions Vascular disorders: Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery and vein obstruction); cases have been associated with concomitant use of combined hormonal contraceptives"

Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid and tissue plasminogen activators. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Because tranexamic acid is antifibrinolytic, concomitant use of combined hormonal contraception and tranexamic acid may increase the thrombotic risk associated with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.2 Tissue Plasminogen Activators Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid and tissue plasminogen activators. Discontinue tranexamic acid if a patient requires tissue plasminogen activators. 7.3 Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid is not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.4 All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid is not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

There are no available data on tranexamic acid use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. Animal reproduction studies have not identified adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tranexamic acid to pregnant rats at doses up to 4 times the recommended human dose (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, tranexamic acid had no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when administered during the period of organogenesis (from gestation days 6 through 17) at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg (1, 2 and 4 times the recommended human oral dosage of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 )). In a perinatal-postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats administered tranexamic acid from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg, no significant adverse effects on maternal behavior or body weight were observed, and no significant effects on pup viability, body weight, developmental milestones or adult fertility were observed. It was concluded that the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1500 mg/kg/day in both F 0 and F 1 generations, which is equivalent to 4 times the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tranexamic acid is present in the mother\u2019s milk at a concentration of about one hundredth of the corresponding serum concentration (see Data). The amount of tranexamic acid a nursing infant would absorb is unknown. There are no adequate data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects of tranexamic acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from tranexamic acid or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Human Data One hour after the last dose following a 2-day treatment course in lactating women, the milk concentration of the tranexamic acid was 1% of the peak serum concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of tranexamic acid have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for those 17 years and older. Tranexamic acid is not indicated before menarche. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tranexamic acid is indicated for females of reproductive potential and is not intended for use by postmenopausal women. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid has not been studied. Because tranexamic acid is primarily eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration with more than 95% excreted as unchanged in urine, the recommended dosage in patient with renal impairment is lower than the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid has not been studied. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, at in vitro concentrations of 25 to 100 \u00b5M, reduces by 20 to 60% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving tranexamic acid total oral doses of 2 to 3 g/day for 5 days. In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid 1300 mg (2) tranexamic acid 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid in women aged 18 to 49 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5 th dose of tranexamic acid on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid are shown in Table 3. Table 3.

A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110 to 116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid is indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 to 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 to 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore,tranexamic acid is not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ]."

Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of Tranexamic Acid in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life a AUC 0-tau (mcg\u2219h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours b Data presented as median (range) Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2219h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 a (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2219h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) b 2.5 (1 to 5) 2.5 (2 to 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - Effect of food: Tranexamic acid may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110 to 116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid is indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 to 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 to 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore,tranexamic acid is not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ]."

Female mice were not included in this experiment. The dose multiple referenced above is based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Actual daily dose in mice was up to 5000 mg/kg/day in food. Hyperplasia of the biliary tract and cholangioma and adenocarcinoma of the intrahepatic biliary system have been reported in one strain of rats after dietary administration of doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose for 22 months. Hyperplastic, but not neoplastic, lesions were reported at lower doses. Subsequent long-term dietary administration studies in a different strain of rat, each with an exposure level equal to the maximum level employed in the earlier experiment, have failed to show such hyperplastic/neoplastic changes in the liver. Mutagenesis Tranexamic acid was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in the in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames test), in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster cells, and in in vivo chromosome aberration tests in mice and rats. Impairment of Fertility Reproductive studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits have not revealed any evidence of impaired fertility or adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Ocular Effects In a 9-month toxicology study, dogs were administered tranexamic acid in food at doses of 0, 200, 600, or 1200 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 2, 5, and 6 times, respectively, the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on AUC. At 6 times the human dose, some dogs developed reversible reddening and gelatinous discharge from the eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed reversible changes in the nictitating membrane/conjunctiva. In some female dogs, the presence of inflammatory exudate over the bulbar conjunctival mucosa was observed. Histopathological examinations did not reveal any retinal alteration. No adverse effects were observed at 5 times the human dose. In other studies, focal areas of retinal degeneration were observed in cats, dogs and rats following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid doses at 6 to 40 times the recommended usual human dose based on mg/m 2 (actual animal doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of the Clinical Studies The efficacy of tranexamic acid in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women of reproductive potential was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: one 3-cycle treatment study (Study 1) and one 6-cycle treatment study (Study 2) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In these studies, HMB was defined as an average menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL as assessed by alkaline hematin analysis of collected sanitary products over two baseline menstrual cycles. Subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21 to 35 days, and a BMI of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had an HMB history of approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. In these studies, the primary outcome measure was menstrual blood loss (MBL), measured using the alkaline hematin method. The endpoint was change from baseline in MBL, calculated by subtracting the mean MBL during treatment from the mean pretreatment MBL. The key secondary outcome measures were based on specific questions concerning limitations in social or leisure activities (LSLA) and limitations in physical activities (LPA). Large stains (soiling beyond the undergarment) were also included as a key secondary outcome measure. 14.2 Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in the Three-Cycle Treatment Study Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo on MBL over a 3-cycle treatment duration. Of the 294 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid 1950 mg/day, 112 subjects received tranexamic acid 3900 mg/day and 67 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 4. Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. The 1950 mg/day tranexamic acid dose did not meet the criteria for success.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with concomitant use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use ( 5.1 ). Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures ( 5.2 ). Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention ( 5.3 ). Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur ( 5.4 ). Dizziness. Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs ( 5.5 ). 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )]. 5.2 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not FDA approved and which uses doses of up to ten-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if seizures occur. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.4 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1,600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.5 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection affects them."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Thromboembolic Risk [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Visual Disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Dizziness [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic dermatitis, giddiness, hypotension, and thromboembolic events ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data ) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times(rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adult and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient's serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data ) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times(rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to seven or eight hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] .

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.1 ) Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration: FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid injection. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . 5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid injection. Syringes containing tranexamic acid injection should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration. 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid injection may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid injection is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid injection may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid injection affects them."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data ) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2\u20134% and 15\u201320%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22\u201336 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid injection in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient's serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .

Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Thromboembolism, including retinal occlusion, has been reported with tranexamic acid tablets use. Concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives, Factor IX complex concentrates, anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates or all-trans retinoic acid (oral tretinoin) may increase the risk of thrombosis. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Visual or ocular adverse reactions may occur with tranexamic acid tablets. Immediately discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 In case of severe allergic reaction, discontinue tranexamic acid tablets and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism, as well as cases of retinal artery and retinal vein occlusions, have been reported with tranexamic acid. Retinal venous and arterial occlusion have been reported in patients using tranexamic acid. Patients should be instructed to report visual and ocular symptoms promptly. In the event of such symptoms, patients should be instructed to discontinue tranexamic acid tablets immediately and should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including dilated retinal examination, to exclude the possibility of retinal venous or arterial occlusion. Concomitant Use of Hormonal Contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Because tranexamic acid is antifibrinolytic, the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke, may increase further when combined hormonal contraceptives are administered with tranexamic acid tablets. This is of particular concern in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes, especially smokers over 35 years of age. Women using combined hormonal contraception were excluded from the clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid, and there are no clinical trial data on the risk of thrombotic events with the concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives. However, there have been US postmarketing reports of venous and arterial thrombotic events in women who have used tranexamic acid tablets concomitantly with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Concomitant Use with Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Taking Concomitant All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.2 Severe Allergic Reactions A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid was reported in the clinical trials, involving a subject who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. A case of anaphylactic shock has also been reported in the literature, involving a patient who received an intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid tablets are contraindicated in females of reproductive potential with known hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. 5.4 Ligneous Conjunctivitis Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. The conjunctivitis resolved following cessation of tranexamic acid tablets."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (\u2265 5%, and more frequent in tranexamic acid-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects) are headache, sinus and nasal symptoms, back pain, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, joint pain, muscle cramps, migraine, anemia and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-855-204-1431 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adverse Reactions in Short-term Studies The safety of tranexamic acid in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in females of reproductive potential was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . \u2022 Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo over a 3-cycle treatment duration. A total of 304 women were randomized to this study, with 115 receiving at least one dose of 3900 mg/day of tranexamic acid tablets. \u2022 Study 2 compared the effects of tranexamic acid tablets (3900 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6-cycle treatment duration. A total of 196 women were randomized to this study, with 117 receiving at least one dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Across the studies, the combined exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 947 cycles and the average duration of use was 3.4 days per cycle. In both studies, subjects were generally healthy women who had menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL. In these studies, subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21-35 days, and a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the trials. A list of adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid-treated subjects receiving 3900 mg/day compared to placebo-treated subjects is provided in Table 2. Table 2. Adverse Reactions* Reported in Women with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (Studies 1 and 2) Tranexamic Acid Tablets 3900 mg/day n (%) (N=232) Placebo n (%) (N=139) Number of Subjects with at Least One Adverse Reaction 208 (89.7%) 122 (87.8%) Headache a 117 (50.4%) 65 (46.8%) Nasal & sinus symptoms b 59 (25.4%) 24 (17.3%) Back pain 48 (20.7%) 21 (15.1%) Abdominal pain c 46 (19.8%) 25 (18.0%) Musculoskeletal pain d 26 (11.2%) 4 (2.9%) Arthralgia e 16 (6.9%) 7 (5.0%) Muscle cramps & spasms 15 (6.5%) 8 (5.8%) Migraine 14 (6.0%) 8 (5.8%) Anemia 13 (5.6%) 5 (3.6%) Fatigue 12 (5.2%) 6 (4.3%) * Adverse reactions that were reported by \u2265 5% of tranexamic acid-treated subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects a Includes headache and tension headache b Nasal and sinus symptoms include nasal, respiratory tract and sinus congestion, sinusitis, acute sinusitis, sinus headache, allergic sinusitis and sinus pain, and multiple allergies and seasonal allergies c Abdominal pain includes abdominal tenderness and discomfort d Musculoskeletal pain includes musculoskeletal discomfort and myalgia e Arthralgia includes joint stiffness and swelling Adverse Reactions in Long-term Studies Long-term safety of tranexamic acid was studied in two open-label studies. In one study, subjects with physician-diagnosed heavy menstrual bleeding (not using the alkaline hematin methodology) were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 781 subjects were enrolled and 239 completed the study through 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 12.4% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the study. The total exposure in this study to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 10,213 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablet use was 2.9 days per cycle. A long-term open-label extension study of subjects from the two short-term efficacy studies was also conducted in which subjects were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 288 subjects were enrolled and 196 subjects completed the study through 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 2.1% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. The total exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets in this study was 1,956 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablet use was 3.5 days per cycle. The types and severity of adverse reactions in these two long-term open-label trials were similar to those observed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies although the percentage of subjects reporting them was greater in the 27-month study, most likely because of the longer study duration. A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid was reported in the extension trial, involving a subject on her fourth cycle of treatment, who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with tranexamic acid tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Eye disorders : Impaired color vision and other visual disturbances \u2022 Gastrointestinal disorders : Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea \u2022 Immune system disorders : Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reactions \u2022 Nervous system disorders : Dizziness \u2022 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Allergic skin reactions \u2022 Vascular disorders : Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery and vein obstruction); cases have been"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Geriatric use: Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated for use in postmenopausal women ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal impairment: A lower dosage is needed. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is needed. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated for use in pregnant women . There are no available data on tranexamic acid use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. Animal reproduction studies have not identified adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tranexamic acid to pregnant rats at doses up to 4 times the recommended human dose (see Data) . In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, tranexamic acid had no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when administered during the period of organogenesis (from gestation days 6 through 17) at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg (1, 2 and 4 times the recommended human oral dosage of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 )). In a perinatal-postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats administered tranexamic acid from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg, no significant adverse effects on maternal behavior or body weight were observed, and no significant effects on pup viability, body weight, developmental milestones or adult fertility were observed. It was concluded that the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1500 mg/kg/day in both F 0 and F 1 generations, which is equivalent to 4 times the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tranexamic acid is present in the mother\u2019s milk at a concentration of about one hundredth of the corresponding serum concentration (see Data) . The amount of tranexamic acid a nursing infant would absorb is unknown. There are no adequate data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects of tranexamic acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from tranexamic acid tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Human Data One hour after the last dose following a 2-day treatment course in lactating women, the milk concentration of the tranexamic acid was 1% of the peak serum concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of tranexamic acid tablets have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for those 17 years and older. Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated before menarche. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive potential and are not intended for use by postmenopausal women. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid has not been studied. Because tranexamic acid is primarily eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration with more than 95% excreted as unchanged in urine, the recommended dosage in patient with renal impairment is lower than the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid has not been studied. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

Data Animal Data In a rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, tranexamic acid had no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when administered during the period of organogenesis (from gestation days 6 through 17) at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg (1, 2 and 4 times the recommended human oral dosage of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 )). In a perinatal-postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats administered tranexamic acid from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg, no significant adverse effects on maternal behavior or body weight were observed, and no significant effects on pup viability, body weight, developmental milestones or adult fertility were observed. It was concluded that the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1500 mg/kg/day in both F 0 and F 1 generations, which is equivalent to 4 times the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 )."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u00b5mol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u00b5mol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, at in vitro concentrations of 25 - 100 \u00b5M, reduces by 20 - 60% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving tranexamic acid total oral doses of 2-3 g/day for 5 days. In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid tablets 1300 mg, (2) tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid tablets, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid in women aged 18\u201149 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid tablets for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5 th dose of tranexamic acid tablets on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid tablets are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2219h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 a (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2219h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) b 2.5 (1 \u2013 5) 2.5 (2 \u2013 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life a AUC 0-tau (mcg\u00b7h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours b Data presented as median (range) Effect of food : Tranexamic acid tablets may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110-116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 \u2013 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 \u2013 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study. [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] ."

Female mice were not included in this experiment. The dose multiple referenced above is based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Actual daily dose in mice was up to 5000 mg/kg/day in food. Hyperplasia of the biliary tract and cholangioma and adenocarcinoma of the intrahepatic biliary system have been reported in one strain of rats after dietary administration of doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose for 22 months. Hyperplastic, but not neoplastic, lesions were reported at lower doses. Subsequent long-term dietary administration studies in a different strain of rat, each with an exposure level equal to the maximum level employed in the earlier experiment, have failed to show such hyperplastic/neoplastic changes in the liver. Mutagenesis Tranexamic acid was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in the in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames test), in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster cells, and in in vivo chromosome aberration tests in mice and rats.

At 6 times the human dose, some dogs developed reversible reddening and gelatinous discharge from the eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed reversible changes in the nictitating membrane/conjunctiva. In some female dogs, the presence of inflammatory exudate over the bulbar conjunctival mucosa was observed. Histopathological examinations did not reveal any retinal alteration. No adverse effects were observed at 5 times the human dose. In other studies, focal areas of retinal degeneration were observed in cats, dogs and rats following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid doses at 6-40 times the recommended usual human dose based on mg/m 2 (actual animal doses between 250-1600 mg/kg/day)."

Mutagenesis Tranexamic acid was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in the in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames test), in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster cells, and in in vivo chromosome aberration tests in mice and rats. Impairment of Fertility Reproductive studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits have not revealed any evidence of impaired fertility or adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid."

      "13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Ocular Effects In a 9-month toxicology study, dogs were administered tranexamic acid in food at doses of 0, 200, 600, or 1200 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 2, 5, and 6 times, respectively, the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on AUC. At 6 times the human dose, some dogs developed reversible reddening and gelatinous discharge from the eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed reversible changes in the nictitating membrane/conjunctiva. In some female dogs, the presence of inflammatory exudate over the bulbar conjunctival mucosa was observed. Histopathological examinations did not reveal any retinal alteration. No adverse effects were observed at 5 times the human dose. In other studies, focal areas of retinal degeneration were observed in cats, dogs and rats following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid doses at 6-40 times the recommended usual human dose based on mg/m 2 (actual animal doses between 250-1600 mg/kg/day)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of the Clinical Studies The efficacy of tranexamic acid in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women of reproductive potential was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: one 3-cycle treatment study (Study 1) and one 6-cycle treatment study (Study 2) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In these studies, HMB was defined as an average menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL as assessed by alkaline hematin analysis of collected sanitary products over two baseline menstrual cycles. Subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21-35 days, and a BMI of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had an HMB history of approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. In these studies, the primary outcome measure was menstrual blood loss (MBL), measured using the alkaline hematin method. The endpoint was change from baseline in MBL, calculated by subtracting the mean MBL during treatment from the mean pretreatment MBL. The key secondary outcome measures were based on specific questions concerning limitations in social or leisure activities (LSLA) and limitations in physical activities (LPA). Large stains (soiling beyond the undergarment) were also included as a key secondary outcome measure. 14.2 Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in the Three-Cycle Treatment Study Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo on MBL over a 3-cycle treatment duration. Of the 294 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 1950 mg/day, 112 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg/day and 67 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 4. Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. The 1950 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets dose did not meet the criteria for success. Table 4.

Of the 187 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets and 72 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 6. MBL was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. Table 6.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.1 ) Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration: FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid injection. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . 5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid injection. Syringes containing tranexamic acid injection should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration. 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid injection may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid injection is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid injection may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid injection affects them."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, chromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions(5.1) , Drug Interactions(7.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid injection in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration(2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology(12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration(2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology(12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a tri exponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration(2.2) , Use in Specific Populations(8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid injection and other drugs have been conducted."

Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively."

      "13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.1 ) Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration: FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with Tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of Tranexamic acid and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . 5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when Tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously. Confirm the correct route of administration for Tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as Tranexamic acid injection. Syringes containing Tranexamic acid injection should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration. 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which Tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue Tranexamic acid if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic acid if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue Tranexamic acid if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how Tranexamic acid affects them."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Caplin Steriles Limited at 1-866-978-6111 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration ( see Data ). Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively ( see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic acid during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic acid administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tranexamic acid; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tranexamic acid and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tranexamic acid or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of Tranexamic acid, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of Tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of Tranexamic acid in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between Tranexamic acid and other drugs have been conducted."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.1 ) Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration: FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with Tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of Tranexamic acid and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.3)] . 5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when Tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously. Confirm the correct route of administration for Tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as Tranexamic acid injection. Syringes containing Tranexamic acid injection should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration. 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which Tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue Tranexamic acid if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic acid if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue Tranexamic acid if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how Tranexamic acid affects them."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic acid during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic acid administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tranexamic acid; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tranexamic acid and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tranexamic acid or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of Tranexamic acid, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of Tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic acid during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic acid administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tranexamic acid; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] .

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious, including fatal, adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid was inadvertently administered via the neuraxial route. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid injection. Clearly label syringes containing tranexamic acid injection with the intravenous route of administration. 5.2 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid via the neuraxial route). Tranexamic acid is contraindicated for neuraxial administration (i.e., epidural, intrathecal). Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid affects them."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, chromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data ) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero . Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation Day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51%, 39%, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid and other drugs have been conducted."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.1 ) Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration: FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )]. 5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid. Syringes containing tranexamic acid should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration. 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid affects them."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data). Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 micromol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 micromol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )].

Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Thromboembolism, including retinal occlusion, has been reported with tranexamic acid tablets use. Concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives, Factor IX complex concentrates, anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates or all-trans retinoic acid (oral tretinoin) may increase the risk of thrombosis. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Visual or ocular adverse reactions may occur with tranexamic acid tablets. Immediately discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 In case of severe allergic reaction, discontinue tranexamic acid tablets and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism, as well as cases of retinal artery and retinal vein occlusions, have been reported with tranexamic acid. Retinal venous and arterial occlusion have been reported in patients using tranexamic acid. Patients should be instructed to report visual and ocular symptoms promptly. In the event of such symptoms, patients should be instructed to discontinue tranexamic acid tablets immediately and should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including dilated retinal examination, to exclude the possibility of retinal venous or arterial occlusion. Concomitant Use of Hormonal Contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Because tranexamic acid is antifibrinolytic, the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke, may increase further when combined hormonal contraceptives are administered with tranexamic acid tablets. This is of particular concern in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes, especially smokers over 35 years of age. Women using combined hormonal contraception were excluded from the clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid, and there are no clinical trial data on the risk of thrombotic events with the concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives. However, there have been US postmarketing reports of venous and arterial thrombotic events in women who have used tranexamic acid tablets concomitantly with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Concomitant Use with Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Taking Concomitant All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.2 Severe Allergic Reactions A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid was reported in the clinical trials, involving a subject who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. A case of anaphylactic shock has also been reported in the literature, involving a patient who received an intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid tablets are contraindicated in females of reproductive potential with known hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. 5.4 Ligneous Conjunctivitis Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. The conjunctivitis resolved following cessation of tranexamic acid tablets."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (\u2265 5%, and more frequent in tranexamic acid-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects) are headache, sinus and nasal symptoms, back pain, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, joint pain, muscle cramps, migraine, anemia and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-308-6755 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adverse Reactions in Short-term Studies The safety of tranexamic acid in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in females of reproductive potential was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . \u2022 Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo over a 3-cycle treatment duration. A total of 304 women were randomized to this study, with 115 receiving at least one dose of 3900 mg/day of tranexamic acid tablets. \u2022 Study 2 compared the effects of tranexamic acid tablets (3900 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6-cycle treatment duration. A total of 196 women were randomized to this study, with 117 receiving at least one dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Across the studies, the combined exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 947 cycles and the average duration of use was 3.4 days per cycle. In both studies, subjects were generally healthy women who had menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL. In these studies, subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21-35 days, and a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the trials. A list of adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid-treated subjects receiving 3900 mg/day compared to placebo-treated subjects is provided in Table 2. Table 2. Adverse Reactions* Reported in Women with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (Studies 1 and 2) Tranexamic Acid Tablets 3900 mg/day n (%) (N=232) Placebo n (%) (N=139) Number of Subjects with at Least One Adverse Reaction 208 (89.7%) 122 (87.8%) Headache a 117 (50.4%) 65 (46.8%) Nasal & sinus symptoms b 59 (25.4%) 24 (17.3%) Back pain 48 (20.7%) 21 (15.1%) Abdominal pain c 46 (19.8%) 25 (18.0%) Musculoskeletal pain d 26 (11.2%) 4 (2.9%) Arthralgia e 16 (6.9%) 7 (5.0%) Muscle cramps & spasms 15 (6.5%) 8 (5.8%) Migraine 14 (6.0%) 8 (5.8%) Anemia 13 (5.6%) 5 (3.6%) Fatigue 12 (5.2%) 6 (4.3%) * Adverse reactions that were reported by \u2265 5% of tranexamic acid-treated subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects a Includes headache and tension headache b Nasal and sinus symptoms include nasal, respiratory tract and sinus congestion, sinusitis, acute sinusitis, sinus headache, allergic sinusitis and sinus pain, and multiple allergies and seasonal allergies c Abdominal pain includes abdominal tenderness and discomfort d Musculoskeletal pain includes musculoskeletal discomfort and myalgia e Arthralgia includes joint stiffness and swelling Adverse Reactions in Long-term Studies Long-term safety of tranexamic acid was studied in two open-label studies. In one study, subjects with physician-diagnosed heavy menstrual bleeding (not using the alkaline hematin methodology) were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 781 subjects were enrolled and 239 completed the study through 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 12.4% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the study. The total exposure in this study to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 10,213 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablet use was 2.9 days per cycle. A long-term open-label extension study of subjects from the two short-term efficacy studies was also conducted in which subjects were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 288 subjects were enrolled and 196 subjects completed the study through 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 2.1% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. The total exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets in this study was 1,956 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablet use was 3.5 days per cycle. The types and severity of adverse reactions in these two long-term open-label trials were similar to those observed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies although the percentage of subjects reporting them was greater in the 27-month study, most likely because of the longer study duration. A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid was reported in the extension trial, involving a subject on her fourth cycle of treatment, who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with tranexamic acid tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Eye disorders : Impaired color vision and other visual disturbances \u2022 Gastrointestinal disorders : Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea \u2022 Immune system disorders : Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reactions \u2022 Nervous system disorders : Dizziness \u2022 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Allergic skin reactions \u2022 Vascular disorders : Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery and vein obstruction); cases have been"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Geriatric use: Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated for use in postmenopausal women ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal impairment: A lower dosage is needed. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) \u2022 Hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is needed. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated for use in pregnant women . There are no available data on tranexamic acid use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. Animal reproduction studies have not identified adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tranexamic acid to pregnant rats at doses up to 4 times the recommended human dose (see Data) . In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, tranexamic acid had no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when administered during the period of organogenesis (from gestation days 6 through 17) at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg (1, 2 and 4 times the recommended human oral dosage of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 )). In a perinatal-postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats administered tranexamic acid from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg, no significant adverse effects on maternal behavior or body weight were observed, and no significant effects on pup viability, body weight, developmental milestones or adult fertility were observed. It was concluded that the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1500 mg/kg/day in both F 0 and F 1 generations, which is equivalent to 4 times the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tranexamic acid is present in the mother\u2019s milk at a concentration of about one hundredth of the corresponding serum concentration (see Data) . The amount of tranexamic acid a nursing infant would absorb is unknown. There are no adequate data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects of tranexamic acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from tranexamic acid tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Human Data One hour after the last dose following a 2-day treatment course in lactating women, the milk concentration of the tranexamic acid was 1% of the peak serum concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of tranexamic acid tablets have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for those 17 years and older. Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated before menarche. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive potential and are not intended for use by postmenopausal women. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid has not been studied. Because tranexamic acid is primarily eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration with more than 95% excreted as unchanged in urine, the recommended dosage in patient with renal impairment is lower than the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid has not been studied. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u00b5mol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u00b5mol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, at in vitro concentrations of 25 - 100 \u00b5M, reduces by 20 - 60% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving tranexamic acid total oral doses of 2-3 g/day for 5 days. In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid tablets 1300 mg, (2) tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid tablets, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid in women aged 18\u201149 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid tablets for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5 th dose of tranexamic acid tablets on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid tablets are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2219h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 a (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2219h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) b 2.5 (1 \u2013 5) 2.5 (2 \u2013 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life a AUC 0-tau (mcg\u00b7h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours b Data presented as median (range) Effect of food : Tranexamic acid tablets may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110-116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 \u2013 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 \u2013 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study. [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of the Clinical Studies The efficacy of tranexamic acid in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women of reproductive potential was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: one 3-cycle treatment study (Study 1) and one 6-cycle treatment study (Study 2) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In these studies, HMB was defined as an average menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL as assessed by alkaline hematin analysis of collected sanitary products over two baseline menstrual cycles. Subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21-35 days, and a BMI of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had an HMB history of approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. In these studies, the primary outcome measure was menstrual blood loss (MBL), measured using the alkaline hematin method. The endpoint was change from baseline in MBL, calculated by subtracting the mean MBL during treatment from the mean pretreatment MBL. The key secondary outcome measures were based on specific questions concerning limitations in social or leisure activities (LSLA) and limitations in physical activities (LPA). Large stains (soiling beyond the undergarment) were also included as a key secondary outcome measure. 14.2 Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in the Three-Cycle Treatment Study Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo on MBL over a 3-cycle treatment duration. Of the 294 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 1950 mg/day, 112 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg/day and 67 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 4. Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. The 1950 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets dose did not meet the criteria for success. Table 4.

Of the 187 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets and 72 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 6. MBL was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. Table 6.

( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dose of tranexamic acid injection is 10 mg/kg actual body weight intravenously administered as a single-dose, immediately before tooth extractions. Infuse no more than 1 mL/minute to avoid hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Following tooth extraction, tranexamic acid injection may be administered for 2 to 8 days at a dose of 10 mg/kg actual body weight 3 to 4 times daily, intravenously. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For intravenous infusion, tranexamic acid injection may be mixed with most solutions for infusion such as electrolyte solutions, carbohydrate solutions, amino acid solutions, and Dextran solutions. Heparin may be added to tranexamic acid injection. Tranexamic acid injection should NOT be mixed with blood. The drug is a synthetic amino acid and should NOT be mixed with solutions containing penicillin. Discard any unused portion. The diluted mixture may be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature prior to patient administration. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Patients with Varying Degrees of Renal Impairment * For patients with moderate to severe impaired renal function, the following dosages are recommended: Table 1: Recommended Dosage in Patients with Varying Degrees of Renal Impairment * Dose reduction is recommended for all doses, both before and after tooth extraction.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.1 ) Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration: FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . 5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid injection. Syringes containing tranexamic acid injection should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration. 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid affects them."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data ) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient's serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] .

Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of thrombosis with concomitant use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.1 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.3 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.4 ) Dizziness. Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . 5.2 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection is not FDA approved and which uses doses of up to ten-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection if seizures occur. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.4 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1,600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.5 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection affects them."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat) and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero . Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 g/kg or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adult and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function [ Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours and in the serum, up to seven or eight hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 liters to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 mL/min to 116 mL/min) and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7 and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39 and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid in 0.7% sodium chloride injection and other drugs have been conducted."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area) and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with concomitant use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use ( 5.1 ). Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures ( 5.2 ). Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention ( 5.3 ). Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur ( 5.4 ). Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs ( 5.5 ). 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . 5.2 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not FDA approved and which uses doses of up to ten-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if seizures occur. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.4 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.5 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection affects them."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Avenacy at 1-855-283-6229 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration ( see Data ). Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively ( see Data ). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero . Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adult and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient's serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration ( see Data ). Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively ( see Data ).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u03bcmol/l) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to seven or eight hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as the unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )].

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with concomitant use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use ( 5.1 ). Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures ( 5.2 ). Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention ( 5.3 ). Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur ( 5.4 ). Dizziness. Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs ( 5.5 ). 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . 5.2 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not FDA approved and which uses doses of up to ten-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if seizures occur. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.4 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.5 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection affects them."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Nexus Pharmaceuticals at (855) 642-2594 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration ( see Data ). Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adult and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient's serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to seven or eight hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] .

Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1), USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.3)]. 5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid. Syringes containing tranexamic acid should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration. 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid affects them."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Thromboembolic Risk [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] Seizures [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)] Visual Disturbances [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)] Dizziness [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data). Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]."

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2), USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6)]. Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid and other drugs have been conducted."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

( 2.1 ) After Extraction: Administer 10 mg/kg actual body weight 3 to 4 times daily for 2 to 8 days. Infuse no more than 1 mL/minute to avoid hypotension. ( 2.1 ). Reduce the dosage for patients with renal impairment. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dose of Tranexamic acid injection is 10 mg/kg actual body weight intravenously administered as a single dose, immediately before tooth extractions. Infuse no more than 1 mL/minute to avoid hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Following tooth extraction, Tranexamic acid injection may be administered for 2 to 8 days at a dose of 10 mg/kg actual body weight 3 to 4 times daily, intravenously. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For intravenous infusion, Tranexamic acid injection may be mixed with most solutions for infusion such as electrolyte solutions, carbohydrate solutions, amino acid solutions, and Dextran solutions. Heparin may be added to Tranexamic acid injection. Tranexamic acid injection should NOT be mixed with blood. The drug is a synthetic amino acid and should NOT be mixed with solutions containing penicillin. Discard any unused portion.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.1 ) Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration: FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with Tranexamic acid injection. Avoid concomitant use of Tranexamic acid injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . 5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrhythmias have occurred when Tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously. Confirm the correct route of administration for Tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as Tranexamic acid injection. Syringes containing Tranexamic acid injection should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration. 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid injection may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which Tranexamic acid injection is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue Tranexamic acid injection if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic acid injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue Tranexamic acid injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid injection may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how Tranexamic acid injection affects them."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC, at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data ) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic acid injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic acid injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic acid injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic acid injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tranexamic acid injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of Tranexamic acid injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of Tranexamic acid injection in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Tranexamic acid injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of Tranexamic acid injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient's serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between Tranexamic acid injection and other drugs have been conducted."

Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between Tranexamic acid injection and other drugs have been conducted."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolism, including retinal occlusion, has been reported with tranexamic acid tablets use. Concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives, Factor IX complex concentrates, anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates or all-trans retinoic acid (oral tretinoin) may increase the risk of thrombosis. (5.1) Visual or ocular adverse reactions may occur with tranexamic acid tablets. Immediately discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. (5.1) In case of severe allergic reaction, discontinue tranexamic acid tablets and seek immediate medical attention. (5.2) Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. (5.3) Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. (5.4) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism, as well as cases of retinal artery and retinal vein occlusions, have been reported with tranexamic acid. Retinal venous and arterial occlusion have been reported in patients using tranexamic acid. Patients should be instructed to report visual and ocular symptoms promptly. In the event of such symptoms, patients should be instructed to discontinue tranexamic acid tablets immediately and should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including dilated retinal examination, to exclude the possibility of retinal venous or arterial occlusion. Concomitant Use of Hormonal Contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Because tranexamic acid is antifibrinolytic, the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke, may increase further when combined hormonal contraceptives are administered with tranexamic acid tablets. This is of particular concern in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes, especially smokers over 35 years of age. Women using combined hormonal contraception were excluded from the clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid, and there are no clinical trial data on the risk of thrombotic events with the concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives. However, there have been US postmarketing reports of venous and arterial thrombotic events in women who have used tranexamic acid tablets concomitantly with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Concomitant Use with Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Taking Concomitant All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.2 Severe Allergic Reactions A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid was reported in the clinical trials, involving a subject who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. A case of anaphylactic shock has also been reported in the literature, involving a patient who received an intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid tablets are contraindicated in females of reproductive potential with known hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. 5.4 Ligneous Conjunctivitis Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. The conjunctivitis resolved following cessation of tranexamic acid tablets."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (\u2265 5%, and more frequent in tranexamic acid-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects) are headache, sinus and nasal symptoms, back pain, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, joint pain, muscle cramps, migraine, anemia and fatigue. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-308-6755 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adverse Reactions in Short-term Studies The safety of tranexamic acid in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in females of reproductive potential was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo over a 3-cycle treatment duration. A total of 304 women were randomized to this study, with 115 receiving at least one dose of 3900 mg/day of tranexamic acid tablets. Study 2 compared the effects of tranexamic acid tablets (3900 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6-cycle treatment duration. A total of 196 women were randomized to this study, with 117 receiving at least one dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Across the studies, the combined exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 947 cycles and the average duration of use was 3.4 days per cycle. In both studies, subjects were generally healthy women who had menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL. In these studies, subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21-35 days, and a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the trials. A list of adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid-treated subjects receiving 3900 mg/day compared to placebo-treated subjects is provided in Table 2. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions that were reported by \u2265 5% of tranexamic acid-treated subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects Reported in Women with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (Studies 1 and 2) Tranexamic Acid Tablets 3900 mg/day n (%) (N=232) Placebo n (%) (N=139) Number of Subjects with at Least One Adverse Reaction 208 (89.7%) 122 (87.8%) Headache Includes headache and tension headache 117 (50.4%) 65 (46.8%) Nasal & sinus symptoms Nasal and sinus symptoms include nasal, respiratory tract and sinus congestion, sinusitis, acute sinusitis, sinus headache, allergic sinusitis and sinus pain, and multiple allergies and seasonal allergies 59 (25.4%) 24 (17.3%) Back pain 48 (20.7%) 21 (15.1%) Abdominal pain Abdominal pain includes abdominal tenderness and discomfort 46 (19.8%) 25 (18.0%) Musculoskeletal pain Musculoskeletal pain includes musculoskeletal discomfort and myalgia 26 (11.2%) 4 (2.9%) Arthralgia Arthralgia includes joint stiffness and swelling 16 (6.9%) 7 (5.0%) Muscle cramps & spasms 15 (6.5%) 8 (5.8%) Migraine 14 (6.0%) 8 (5.8%) Anemia 13 (5.6%) 5 (3.6%) Fatigue 12 (5.2%) 6 (4.3%) Adverse Reactions in Long-term Studies Long-term safety of tranexamic acid was studied in two open-label studies. In one study, subjects with physician-diagnosed heavy menstrual bleeding (not using the alkaline hematin methodology) were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 781 subjects were enrolled and 239 completed the study through 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 12.4% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the study. The total exposure in this study to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets was 10,213 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablet use was 2.9 days per cycle. A long-term open-label extension study of subjects from the two short-term efficacy studies was also conducted in which subjects were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 288 subjects were enrolled and 196 subjects completed the study through 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 2.1% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. The total exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets in this study was 1,956 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid tablet use was 3.5 days per cycle. The types and severity of adverse reactions in these two long-term open-label trials were similar to those observed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies although the percentage of subjects reporting them was greater in the 27-month study, most likely because of the longer study duration. A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid was reported in the extension trial, involving a subject on her fourth cycle of treatment, who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with tranexamic acid tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders : Impaired color vision and other visual disturbances Gastrointestinal disorders : Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Immune system disorders : Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reactions Nervous system disorders : Dizziness Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Allergic skin reactions Vascular disorders : Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery and vein obstruction); cases have been associated with concomitant use of combined hormonal contraceptives"

Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid and tissue plasminogen activators. (7.2) 7.1 Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Because tranexamic acid is antifibrinolytic, concomitant use of combined hormonal contraception and tranexamic acid may increase the thrombotic risk associated with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.2 Tissue Plasminogen Activators Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid and tissue plasminogen activators. Discontinue tranexamic acid tablets if a patient requires tissue plasminogen activators. 7.3 Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.4 All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

(2.3 , 8.6) Hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is needed. (8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated for use in pregnant women. There are no available data on tranexamic acid use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. Animal reproduction studies have not identified adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tranexamic acid to pregnant rats at doses up to 4 times the recommended human dose (see Data) . In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, tranexamic acid had no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when administered during the period of organogenesis (from gestation days 6 through 17) at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg (1, 2 and 4 times the recommended human oral dosage of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 )). In a perinatal-postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats administered tranexamic acid from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg, no significant adverse effects on maternal behavior or body weight were observed, and no significant effects on pup viability, body weight, developmental milestones or adult fertility were observed. It was concluded that the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1500 mg/kg/day in both F 0 and F 1 generations, which is equivalent to 4 times the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tranexamic acid is present in the mother\u2019s milk at a concentration of about one hundredth of the corresponding serum concentration (see Data) . The amount of tranexamic acid a nursing infant would absorb is unknown. There are no adequate data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects of tranexamic acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from tranexamic acid tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Human Data One hour after the last dose following a 2-day treatment course in lactating women, the milk concentration of the tranexamic acid was 1% of the peak serum concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of tranexamic acid tablets have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for those 17 years and older. Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated before menarche. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive potential and are not intended for use by postmenopausal women. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid has not been studied. Because tranexamic acid is primarily eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration with more than 95% excreted as unchanged in urine, the recommended dosage in patient with renal impairment is lower than the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid has not been studied. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u00b5mol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u00b5mol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, at in vitro concentrations of 25 - 100 \u00b5M, reduces by 20 - 60% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving tranexamic acid total oral doses of 2-3 g/day for 5 days. In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid tablets 1300 mg, (2) tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid tablets. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid tablets, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid in women aged 18\u201149 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid tablets for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5 th dose of tranexamic acid tablets on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid tablets are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2219h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 AUC0-tau (mcg\u00b7h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2219h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) Data presented as median (range) 2.5 (1 \u2013 5) 2.5 (2 \u2013 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life Effect of food : Tranexamic acid tablets may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110-116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 \u2013 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 \u2013 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ]."

Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid tablets for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5 th dose of tranexamic acid tablets on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid tablets are shown in Table 3. Table 3.

A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110-116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 \u2013 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 \u2013 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ]."

Female mice were not included in this experiment. The dose multiple referenced above is based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Actual daily dose in mice was up to 5000 mg/kg/day in food. Hyperplasia of the biliary tract and cholangioma and adenocarcinoma of the intrahepatic biliary system have been reported in one strain of rats after dietary administration of doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose for 22 months. Hyperplastic, but not neoplastic, lesions were reported at lower doses. Subsequent long-term dietary administration studies in a different strain of rat, each with an exposure level equal to the maximum level employed in the earlier experiment, have failed to show such hyperplastic/neoplastic changes in the liver. Mutagenesis Tranexamic acid was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in the in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames test), in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster cells, and in in vivo chromosome aberration tests in mice and rats. Impairment of Fertility Reproductive studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits have not revealed any evidence of impaired fertility or adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Ocular Effects In a 9-month toxicology study, dogs were administered tranexamic acid in food at doses of 0, 200, 600, or 1200 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 2, 5, and 6 times, respectively, the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on AUC. At 6 times the human dose, some dogs developed reversible reddening and gelatinous discharge from the eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed reversible changes in the nictitating membrane/conjunctiva. In some female dogs, the presence of inflammatory exudate over the bulbar conjunctival mucosa was observed. Histopathological examinations did not reveal any retinal alteration. No adverse effects were observed at 5 times the human dose. In other studies, focal areas of retinal degeneration were observed in cats, dogs and rats following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid doses at 6-40 times the recommended usual human dose based on mg/m 2 (actual animal doses between 250-1600 mg/kg/day)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of the Clinical Studies The efficacy of tranexamic acid in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women of reproductive potential was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: one 3-cycle treatment study (Study 1) and one 6-cycle treatment study (Study 2) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In these studies, HMB was defined as an average menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL as assessed by alkaline hematin analysis of collected sanitary products over two baseline menstrual cycles. Subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21-35 days, and a BMI of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had an HMB history of approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. In these studies, the primary outcome measure was menstrual blood loss (MBL), measured using the alkaline hematin method. The endpoint was change from baseline in MBL, calculated by subtracting the mean MBL during treatment from the mean pretreatment MBL. The key secondary outcome measures were based on specific questions concerning limitations in social or leisure activities (LSLA) and limitations in physical activities (LPA). Large stains (soiling beyond the undergarment) were also included as a key secondary outcome measure. 14.2 Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in the Three-Cycle Treatment Study Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo on MBL over a 3-cycle treatment duration. Of the 294 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 1950 mg/day, 112 subjects received tranexamic acid tablets 3900 mg/day and 67 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 4. Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. The 1950 mg/day tranexamic acid tablets dose did not meet the criteria for success. Table 4.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.1 ) Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration: FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid injection. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . 5.2 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered intrathecally instead of intravenously. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid injection. Syringes containing tranexamic acid injection should be clearly labeled with the intravenous route of administration. 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid injection may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic acid injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1,600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid injection may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid injection affects them."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Avet Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-866-901-DRUG (3784) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid injection in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient's serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid and other drugs have been conducted."

Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of Thrombosis with concomitant use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use seek immediate medical attention ( 5.3 ). \u2022 Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur ( 5.4 ). \u2022 Dizziness may occur. Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs ( 5.5 ). 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include, but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . 5.2 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not FDA approved and which uses doses of up to ten-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider EEG monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if seizures occur. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.4 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats, dogs and rats following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (6 to 40 times the recommended usual human dose) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.5 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection affects them."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact [Enter Company Name] or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not identified a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are no reports regarding the use of tranexamic acid during the first trimester of pregnancy; therefore, there are no data regarding the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy. However, tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data). Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid. The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15\u221220%, respectively. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/ kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/liter, as high as in the maternal blood. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adult and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/l) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to seven or eight hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min) and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as the unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and other drugs have been conducted."

The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and other drugs have been conducted."

Female mice were not included in this experiment. Hyperplasia of the biliary tract and cholangioma and adenocarcinoma of the intrahepatic biliary system have been reported in one strain of rats after dietary administration of doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose for 22 months. Hyperplastic, but not neoplastic, lesions were reported at lower doses. Subsequent long-term dietary administration studies in a different strain of rat, each with an exposure level equal to the maximum level employed in the earlier experiment, have failed to show such hyperplastic/neoplastic changes in the liver.

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolism, including retinal occlusion, has been reported with tranexamic acid use. Concomitant use of tranexamic acid with combined hormonal contraceptives, Factor IX complex concentrates, anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates or all-trans retinoic acid (oral tretinoin) may increase the risk of thrombosis. (5.1) Visual or ocular adverse reactions may occur with tranexamic acid. Immediately discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. (5.1) In case of severe allergic reaction, discontinue tranexamic acid and seek immediate medical attention. (5.2) Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. (5.3) Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid (5.4) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism, as well as cases of retinal artery and retinal vein occlusions, have been reported with tranexamic acid. Retinal venous and arterial occlusion have been reported in patients using tranexamic acid. Patients should be instructed to report visual and ocular symptoms promptly. In the event of such symptoms, patients should be instructed to discontinue tranexamic acid, immediately and should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including dilated retinal examination, to exclude the possibility of retinal venous or arterial occlusion. Concomitant Use of Hormonal Contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Because tranexamic acid is antifibrinolytic, the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke, may increase further when combined hormonal contraceptives are administered with tranexamic acid. This is of particular concern in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes, especially smokers over 35 years of age. Women using combined hormonal contraception were excluded from the clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid, and there are no clinical trial data on the risk of thrombotic events with the concomitant use of tranexamic acid with combined hormonal contraceptives. However, there have been US postmarketing reports of venous and arterial thrombotic events in women who have used tranexamic acid concomitantly with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Concomitant Use with Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid is not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Taking Concomitant All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid is not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.2 Severe Allergic Reactions A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid was reported in the clinical trials, involving a subject who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. A case of anaphylactic shock has also been reported in the literature, involving a patient who received an intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid tablets are contraindicated in females of reproductive potential with known hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. 5.4 Ligneous Conjunctivitis Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. The conjunctivitis resolved following cessation of tranexamic acid."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (\u2265 5%, and more frequent in tranexamic acid-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects) are headache, sinus and nasal symptoms, back pain, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, joint pain, muscle cramps, migraine, anemia and fatigue. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Appco Pharma LLC at 1-855-672-7726 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adverse Reactions in Short-term Studies The safety of tranexamic acid in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in females of reproductive potential was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo over a 3-cycle treatment duration. A total of 304 women were randomized to this study, with 115 receiving at least one dose of 3900 mg/day of tranexamic acid. Study 2 compared the effects of tranexamic acid (3900 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6-cycle treatment duration. A total of 196 women were randomized to this study, with 117 receiving at least one dose of tranexamic acid. Across the studies, the combined exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid was 947 cycles and the average duration of use was 3.4 days per cycle. In both studies, subjects were generally healthy women who had menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL. In these studies, subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21 to 35 days, and a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the trials. A list of adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid \u2013treated subjects receiving 3900 mg/day compared to placebo-treated subjects is provided in Table 2. Table 2. Adverse Reactions* Reported in Women with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (Studies 1 and 2) Tranexamic acid 3900 mg/day n (%) (N=232) Placebo n (%) (N=139) Number of Subjects with at Least One Adverse Reaction 208 (89.7%) 122 (87.8%) Headache 1 117 (50.4%) 65 (46.8%) Nasal & sinus symptoms 2 59 (25.4%) 24 (17.3%) Back pain 48 (20.7%) 21 (15.1%) Abdominal pain 3 46 (19.8%) 25 (18.0%) Musculoskeletal pain 4 26 (11.2%) 4 (2.9%) Arthralgia 5 16 (6.9%) 7 (5.0%) Muscle cramps & spasms 15 (6.5%) 8 (5.8%) Migraine 14 (6.0%) 8 (5.8%) Anemia 13 (5.6%) 5 (3.6%) Fatigue 12 (5.2%) 6 (4.3%) * Adverse reactions that were reported by \u2265 5% of tranexamic acid-treated subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects 1 Includes headache and tension headache 2 Nasal and sinus symptoms include nasal, respiratory tract and sinus congestion, sinusitis, acute sinusitis, sinus headache, allergic sinusitis and sinus pain, and multiple allergies and seasonal allergies 3 Abdominal pain includes abdominal tenderness and discomfort 4 Musculoskeletal pain includes musculoskeletal discomfort and myalgia 5 Arthralgia includes joint stiffness and swelling Adverse Reactions in Long-term Studies Long-term safety of tranexamic acid was studied in two open-label studies. In one study, subjects with physician-diagnosed heavy menstrual bleeding (not using the alkaline hematin methodology) were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 781 subjects were enrolled and 239 completed the study through 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 12.4% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the study. The total exposure in this study to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid was 10,213 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid use was 2.9 days per cycle. A long-term open-label extension study of subjects from the two short-term efficacy studies was also conducted in which subjects were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 288 subjects were enrolled and 196 subjects completed the study through 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 2.1% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. The total exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid in this study was 1,956 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid use was 3.5 days per cycle. The types and severity of adverse reactions in these two long-term open-label trials were similar to those observed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies although the percentage of subjects reporting them was greater in the 27-month study, most likely because of the longer study duration. A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid was reported in the extension trial, involving a subject on her fourth cycle of treatment, who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders : Impaired color vision and other visual disturbances Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Immune system disorders: Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reactions Nervous system disorders: Dizziness Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Allergic skin reactions Vascular disorders: Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery and vein obstruction); cases have been associated with concomitant use of combined hormonal contraceptives"

(2.2, 8.6) Hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is needed. (8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Tranexamic acid is not indicated for use in pregnant women. There are no available data on tranexamic acid use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. Animal reproduction studies have not identified adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tranexamic acid to pregnant rats at doses up to 4 times the recommended human dose (see Data). In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, tranexamic acid had no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when administered during the period of organogenesis (from gestation days 6 through 17) at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg (1, 2 and 4 times the recommended human oral dosage of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 )). In a perinatal-postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats administered tranexamic acid from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg, no significant adverse effects on maternal behavior or body weight were observed, and no significant effects on pup viability, body weight, developmental milestones or adult fertility were observed. It was concluded that the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1500 mg/kg/day in both F 0 and F 1 generations, which is equivalent to 4 times the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tranexamic acid is present in the mother\u2019s milk at a concentration of about one hundredth of the corresponding serum concentration (see Data). The amount of tranexamic acid a nursing infant would absorb is unknown. There are no adequate data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects of tranexamic acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from tranexamic acid or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Human Data One hour after the last dose following a 2-day treatment course in lactating women, the milk concentration of the tranexamic acid was 1% of the peak serum concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of tranexamic acid have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for those 17 years and older. Tranexamic acid is not indicated before menarche. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tranexamic acid is indicated for females of reproductive potential and is not intended for use by postmenopausal women. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid has not been studied. Because tranexamic acid is primarily eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration with more than 95% excreted as unchanged in urine, the recommended dosage in patient with renal impairment is lower than the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid has not been studied. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u00b5mol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u00b5mol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, at in vitro concentrations of 25 to 100 \u00b5M, reduces by 20 to 60% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving tranexamic acid total oral doses of 2 to 3 g/day for 5 days. In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid 1300 mg (2) tranexamic acid 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid in women aged 18 to\u00ad 49 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5 th dose of tranexamic acid on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of Tranexamic Acid in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2219h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 1 (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2219h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) 2 2.5 (1 to 5) 2.5 (2 to 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life 1 AUC 0 to tau (mcg\u00b7h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours 2 Data presented as median (range) Effect of food: Tranexamic acid may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg) of tranexamic acid with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110 to 116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid is indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 to 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 to 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study. [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid is not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]."

Female mice were not included in this experiment. The dose multiple referenced above is based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Actual daily dose in mice was up to 5000 mg/kg/day in food. Hyperplasia of the biliary tract and cholangioma and adenocarcinoma of the intrahepatic biliary system have been reported in one strain of rats after dietary administration of doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose for 22 months. Hyperplastic, but not neoplastic, lesions were reported at lower doses. Subsequent long-term dietary administration studies in a different strain of rat, each with an exposure level equal to the maximum level employed in the earlier experiment, have failed to show such hyperplastic/neoplastic changes in the liver. Mutagenesis Tranexamic acid was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in the in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames test), in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster cells, and in in vivo chromosome aberration tests in mice and rats. Impairment of Fertility Reproductive studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits have not revealed any evidence of impaired fertility or adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Ocular Effects In a 9-month toxicology study, dogs were administered tranexamic acid in food at doses of 0, 200, 600, or 1200 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 2, 5, and 6 times, respectively, the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on AUC. At 6 times the human dose, some dogs developed reversible reddening and gelatinous discharge from the eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed reversible changes in the nictitating membrane/conjunctiva. In some female dogs, the presence of inflammatory exudate over the bulbar conjunctival mucosa was observed. Histopathological examinations did not reveal any retinal alteration. No adverse effects were observed at 5 times the human dose. In other studies, focal areas of retinal degeneration were observed in cats, dogs and rats following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid doses at 6 to 40 times the recommended usual human dose based on mg/m 2 (actual animal doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of the Clinical Studies The efficacy of tranexamic acid in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women of reproductive potential was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: one 3-cycle treatment study (Study 1) and one 6-cycle treatment study (Study 2) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In these studies, HMB was defined as an average menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL as assessed by alkaline hematin analysis of collected sanitary products over two baseline menstrual cycles. Subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21 to 35 days, and a BMI of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had an HMB history of approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. In these studies, the primary outcome measure was menstrual blood loss (MBL), measured using the alkaline hematin method. The endpoint was change from baseline in MBL, calculated by subtracting the mean MBL during treatment from the mean pretreatment MBL. The key secondary outcome measures were based on specific questions concerning limitations in social or leisure activities (LSLA) and limitations in physical activities (LPA). Large stains (soiling beyond the undergarment) were also included as a key secondary outcome measure. 14.2 Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in the Three-Cycle Treatment Study Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo on MBL over a 3-cycle treatment duration. Of the 294 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid 1950 mg/day, 112 subjects received tranexamic acid 3900 mg/day and 67 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 4. Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. The 1950 mg/day tranexamic acid dose did not meet the criteria for success.

Of the 187 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid and 72 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 6. MBL was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. Table 6.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolism, including retinal occlusion, has been reported with tranexamic acid USP tablets use. Concomitant use of tranexamic acid USP tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives, Factor IX complex concentrates, anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates or all-trans retinoic acid (oral tretinoin) may increase the risk of thrombosis. ( 5.1 ) Visual or ocular adverse reactions may occur with tranexamic acid USP tablets. Immediately discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) In case of severe allergic reaction, discontinue tranexamic acid USP tablets and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.2 ) Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid USP tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. ( 5.3 ) Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism, as well as cases of retinal artery and retinal vein occlusions, have been reported with tranexamic acid USP tablets. Retinal venous and arterial occlusion have been reported in patients using tranexamic acid. Patients should be instructed to report visual and ocular symptoms promptly. In the event of such symptoms, patients should be instructed to discontinue tranexamic acid USP tablets immediately and should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including dilated retinal examination, to exclude the possibility of retinal venous or arterial occlusion. Concomitant Use of Hormonal Contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Because tranexamic acid USP tablets are antifibrinolytic, the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke, may increase further when combined hormonal contraceptives are administered with tranexamic acid USP tablets. This is of particular concern in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes, especially smokers over 35 years of age. Women using combined hormonal contraception were excluded from the clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid USP tablets, and there are no clinical trial data on the risk of thrombotic events with the concomitant use of tranexamic acid USP tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives. However, there have been US postmarketing reports of venous and arterial thrombotic events in women who have used tranexamic acid USP tablets concomitantly with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Concomitant Use with Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid USP tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Taking Concomitant All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid USP tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.2 Severe Allergic Reactions A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid USP tablets was reported in the clinical trials, involving a subject who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. A case of anaphylactic shock has also been reported in the literature, involving a patient who received an intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid USP tablets are contraindicated in females of reproductive potential with known hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of tranexamic acid USP tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. 5.4 Ligneous Conjunctivitis Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking tranexamic acid. The conjunctivitis resolved following cessation of tranexamic acid USP tablets."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (\u2265 5%, and more frequent in tranexamic acid USP tablets-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects) are headache, sinus and nasal symptoms, back pain, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, joint pain, muscle cramps, migraine, anemia and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adverse Reactions in Short-term Studies The safety of tranexamic acid USP tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in females of reproductive potential was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid USP tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo over a 3-cycle treatment duration. A total of 304 women were randomized to this study, with 115 receiving at least one dose of 3900 mg/day of tranexamic acid USP tablets. Study 2 compared the effects of tranexamic acid USP tablets (3900 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6-cycle treatment duration. A total of 196 women were randomized to this study, with 117 receiving at least one dose of tranexamic acid USP tablets. Across the studies, the combined exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid USP tablets was 947 cycles and the average duration of use was 3.4 days per cycle. In both studies, subjects were generally healthy women who had menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL. In these studies, subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21-35 days, and a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 32 kg/m 2 . On average, subjects had a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the trials. A list of adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of subjects and more frequently in tranexamic acid USP tablets-treated subjects receiving 3900 mg/day compared to placebo-treated subjects is provided in Table 2. Table 2.

In one study, subjects with physician-diagnosed heavy menstrual bleeding (not using the alkaline hematin methodology) were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 781 subjects were enrolled and 239 completed the study through 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 12.4% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the study. The total exposure in this study to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid USP tablets was 10,213 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid USP tablets use was 2.9 days per cycle. A long-term open-label extension study of subjects from the two short-term efficacy studies was also conducted in which subjects were treated with 3900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 288 subjects were enrolled and 196 subjects completed the study through 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 2.1% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. The total exposure to 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid USP tablets in this study was 1,956 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid USP tablets use was 3.5 days per cycle. The types and severity of adverse reactions in these two long-term open-label trials were similar to those observed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies although the percentage of subjects reporting them was greater in the 27-month study, most likely because of the longer study duration. A case of severe allergic reaction to tranexamic acid USP tablets was reported in the extension trial, involving a subject on her fourth cycle of treatment, who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with tranexamic acid USP tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders: Impaired color vision and other visual disturbances Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Immune system disorders: Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reactions Nervous system disorders: Dizziness Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Allergic skin reactions Vascular disorders: Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery and vein obstruction); cases have been associated with concomitant use of combined hormonal contraceptives"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric use: Tranexamic acid USP tablets is not indicated for use in postmenopausal women ( 8.5 ) Renal impairment: A lower dosage is needed. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) Hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is needed. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Tranexamic acid USP tablets are not indicated for use in pregnant women. There is no available data on tranexamic acid USP tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. Animal reproduction studies have not identified adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tranexamic acid to pregnant rats at doses up to 4 times the recommended human dose ( see Data ). In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, tranexamic acid had no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when administered during the period of organogenesis (from gestation days 6 through 17) at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg (1, 2 and 4 times the recommended human oral dosage of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 )). In a perinatal-postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats administered tranexamic acid from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg, no significant adverse effects on maternal behavior or body weight were observed, and no significant effects on pup viability, body weight, developmental milestones or adult fertility were observed. It was concluded that the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1500 mg/kg/day in both F 0 and F 1 generations, which is equivalent to 4 times the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tranexamic acid is present in the mother\u2019s milk at a concentration of about one hundredth of the corresponding serum concentration (see Data ). The amount of tranexamic acid a nursing infant would absorb is unknown. There are no adequate data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects of tranexamic acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid USP tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from tranexamic acid USP tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Human Data One hour after the last dose following a 2-day treatment course in lactating women, the milk concentration of the tranexamic acid was 1% of the peak serum concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of tranexamic acid USP tablets have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for those 17 years and older. Tranexamic acid USP tablets are not indicated before menarche. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tranexamic acid USP tablets are indicated for females of reproductive potential and is not intended for use by postmenopausal women. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid USP tablets has not been studied. Because tranexamic acid is primarily eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration with more than 95% excreted as unchanged in urine, the recommended dosage in patient with renal impairment is lower than the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid USP tablets has not been studied. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, at in vitro concentrations of 25 - 100 \u03bcM, reduces by 20 - 60% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving tranexamic acid total oral doses of 2-3 g/day for 5 days. In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of tranexamic acid USP tablets on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) tranexamic acid USP tablets 1300 mg (2) tranexamic acid USP tablets 3900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of tranexamic acid USP tablets. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin \u2013 placebo) at 3 hours after administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a single oral administration of 1300 mg of tranexamic acid USP tablets, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of tranexamic acid USP tablets in women aged 18-49 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of tranexamic acid USP tablets for 5 days, the mean C max increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1300 mg ). Plasma concentrations reached steady state at the 5 th dose of tranexamic acid USP tablets on Day 2. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of tranexamic acid determined in 19 healthy women following a single (1300 mg ) and multiple (1300 mg tablets three times daily for 5 days) oral dose of tranexamic acid USP tablets are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single (1300 mg) and Multiple Dose (1300 mg three times daily for 5 days) Oral Administration of tranexamic acid USP tablets in 19 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions Parameter Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Single dose Multiple dose C max = maximum concentration AUC tldc = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration AUC inf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity T max = time to maximum concentration t 1/2 = terminal elimination half-life a AUC 0-tau (mcg\u00b7h/mL) = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to 8 hours b Data presented as median (range) C max (mcg/mL) 13.83 (32.14) 16.41 (26.19) AUC tldc (mcg\u2219h/mL) 77.96 (31.14) 77.67 a (29.39) AUC inf (mcg\u2219h/mL) 80.19 (30.43) - T max (h) b 2.5 (1 \u2013 5) 2.5 (2 \u2013 3.5) t 1/2 (h) 11.08 (16.94) - Effect of food : Tranexamic acid USP tablets may be administered with or without food. A single dose administration (1300 mg ) of tranexamic acid USP tablets with food increased both C max and AUC by 7% and 16%, respectively. Distribution Tranexamic acid is 3% bound to plasma proteins with no apparent binding to albumin. Tranexamic acid is distributed with an initial volume of distribution of 0.18 L/kg and steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 0.39 L/kg. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. Tranexamic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is about one tenth of the plasma concentration. The drug passes into the aqueous humor of the eye achieving a concentration of approximately one tenth of plasma concentrations. Elimination Most elimination post intravenous administration occurred during the first 10 hours, giving an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. The mean terminal half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 11 hours. Plasma clearance of tranexamic acid is 110-116 mL/min. Metabolism A small fraction of the tranexamic acid is metabolized. Excretion Tranexamic acid is eliminated by urinary excretion primarily via glomerular filtration with more than 95% of the dose excreted unchanged. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Tranexamic acid USP tablets are indicated for females of reproductive age (not approved for use in premenarcheal girls). In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32 \u2013 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C max and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1300 mg in the adolescent females were 20 \u2013 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid USP tablets has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of tranexamic acid USP tablets has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid USP tablets. All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) In a study involving 28 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were given either orally administered (1) all-trans retinoic acid plus intravenously administered tranexamic acid, (2) all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, or (3) all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid plus chemotherapy, all 4 patients who were given all-trans retinoic acid plus tranexamic acid died, with 3 of the 4 deaths due to thrombotic complications. The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, tranexamic acid USP tablets is not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies with tranexamic acid in male mice at doses as high as 6 times the recommended human dose of 3900 mg/day showed an increased incidence of leukemia which may have been related to treatment. Female mice were not included in this experiment. The dose multiple referenced above is based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Actual daily dose in mice was up to 5000 mg/kg/day in food. Hyperplasia of the biliary tract and cholangioma and adenocarcinoma of the intrahepatic biliary system have been reported in one strain of rats after dietary administration of doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose for 22 months. Hyperplastic, but not neoplastic, lesions were reported at lower doses. Subsequent long-term dietary administration studies in a different strain of rat, each with an exposure level equal to the maximum level employed in the earlier experiment, have failed to show such hyperplastic/neoplastic changes in the liver. Mutagenesis Tranexamic acid was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in the in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames test), in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster cells, and in in vivo chromosome aberration tests in mice and rats. Impairment of Fertility Reproductive studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits have not revealed any evidence of impaired fertility or adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Ocular Effects In a 9-month toxicology study, dogs were administered tranexamic acid in food at doses of 0, 200, 600, or 1200 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 2, 5, and 6 times, respectively, the recommended human oral dose of 3900 mg/day based on AUC. At 6 times the human dose, some dogs developed reversible reddening and gelatinous discharge from the eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed reversible changes in the nictitating membrane/conjunctiva. In some female dogs, the presence of inflammatory exudate over the bulbar conjunctival mucosa was observed. Histopathological examinations did not reveal any retinal alteration. No adverse effects were observed at 5 times the human dose. In other studies, focal areas of retinal degeneration were observed in cats, dogs and rats following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid doses at 6-40 times the recommended usual human dose based on mg/m 2 (actual animal doses between 250-1600 mg/kg/day)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of the Clinical Studies The efficacy of tranexamic acid USP tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women of reproductive potential was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: one 3-cycle treatment study (Study 1) and one 6-cycle treatment study (Study 2) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In these studies, HMB was defined as an average menstrual blood loss of \u2265 80 mL as assessed by alkaline hematin analysis of collected sanitary products over two baseline menstrual cycles. Subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21-35 days, and a BMI of approximately 32 kg/m2. On average, subjects had an HMB history of approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. In these studies, the primary outcome measure was menstrual blood loss (MBL), measured using the alkaline hematin method. The endpoint was change from baseline in MBL, calculated by subtracting the mean MBL during treatment from the mean pretreatment MBL. The key secondary outcome measures were based on specific questions concerning limitations in social or leisure activities (LSLA) and limitations in physical activities (LPA). Large stains (soiling beyond the undergarment) were also included as a key secondary outcome measure. 14.2 Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in the Three-Cycle Treatment Study Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of tranexamic acid USP tablets (1950 mg and 3900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo on MBL over a 3-cycle treatment duration. Of the 294 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid USP tablets 1950 mg/day, 112 subjects received tranexamic acid USP tablets 3900 mg/day and 67 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 4. Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid USP tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. The 1950 mg/day tranexamic acid USP tablets dose did not meet the criteria for success. Tranexamic acid USP tablets also statistically significantly reduced limitations on social, leisure, and physical activities in the 3900 mg/day dose group compared to the placebo group (see Table 5). No statistically significant treatment difference was observed in response rates on the number of large stains. 4 5 14.3 Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in the Six-Cycle Treatment Study Study 2 compared the effects of tranexamic acid USP tablets 3900 mg/day given daily for up to 5 days during each menstrual period versus placebo on menstrual blood loss (MBL) over a 6-cycle treatment duration. Of the 187 evaluable subjects, 115 subjects received tranexamic acid USP tablets and 72 subjects received placebo (subjects took at least one dose of study drug and had post-treatment data available). Results are shown in Table 6. MBL was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3900 mg/day tranexamic acid USP tablets compared to placebo. Study success also required achieving a reduction in MBL that was determined to be clinically meaningful to the subjects. Table 6.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.4 ) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamicacidinjection is for intravenous use only. Serious, including fatal, adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred whentranexamicacid injection was inadvertently administered via the neuraxial route. Confirm thecorrectroute of administration for tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the sametimeas tranexamic acid injection. Clearly label syringes containing tranexamic acid injection with the intravenous route ofadministration. 5.2 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid injection. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid injection may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid injection is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid via the neuraxial route). Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated for neuraxial administration (i.e., epidural, intrathecal). Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid injection may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid injection affects them."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Micro Labs USA, Inc. at 1-855-839-8195 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, chromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation Day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tranexamic acid injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid injection in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid injection and other drugs have been conducted."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid injection and other drugs have been conducted."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of Thrombosis with concomitant use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention ( 5.3 ). \u2022 Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur ( 5.4 ). \u2022 Dizziness. Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs ( 5.5 ). 5.1 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid. Avoid concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )]. 5.2 Seizures Tranexamic acid may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not FDA approved and which uses doses of up to ten-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid into the neuraxial system). Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is not approved and not recommended for neuraxial administration. Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if seizures occur. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.4 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.5 Dizziness Tranexamic acid may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection affects them."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gland Pharma Limited, at 609-250-7990 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tranexamic acid. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data). Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times(rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data). The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician\u2019s decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adult and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient\u2019s serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22-36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin\u2019s matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to seven or eight hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection and other drugs have been conducted."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Thrombosis with Concomitant Use of Factor IX: Avoid concomitant use. (5.2) Seizures: Inadvertent injection into neuraxial system may result in seizures. (5.3) Hypersensitivity Reactions: In case of severe reaction, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention. (5.4) Visual Disturbances: Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur. Discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. (5.5) Dizziness: Advise patients not to drive if dizziness occurs. (5.6) 5.1 Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration Tranexamic acid injection is for intravenous use only. Serious, including fatal, adverse reactions including seizures and cardiac arrythmias have occurred when tranexamic acid injection was inadvertently administered via the neuraxial route. Confirm the correct route of administration for tranexamic acid injection and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that might be administered at the same time as tranexamic acid injection. Clearly label syringes containing tranexamic acid injection with the intravenous route of administration. 5.2 Thromboembolic Risk Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with active intravascular clotting. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism has been reported in patients treated with tranexamic acid injection. Avoid concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection and medical products that are pro-thrombotic, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased. These medications include but are not limited to, Factor IX Complex concentrates, Anti-inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, and hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.3)] . 5.3 Seizures Tranexamic acid injection may cause seizures, including focal and generalized seizures. The most common setting for tranexamic acid-induced seizures has been during cardiovascular surgery (a setting in which tranexamic acid is not FDA-approved and which uses doses of up to 10-fold higher than the recommended human dose and in patients inadvertently given tranexamic acid via the neuraxial route). Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated for neuraxial administration (i.e., epidural, intrathecal). Consider dose reduction during surgery and dose adjustments for patients with clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. Closely monitor the patient during surgery. Consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with history of seizures or who experience myoclonic movements, twitching, or show evidence of focal seizures. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if seizures occur. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have occurred with use of intravenous tranexamic acid. Discontinue treatment with tranexamic acid injection if serious reaction occurs, provide appropriate medical management, and do not restart treatment. Tranexamic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. 5.5 Visual Disturbances Although not seen in humans, focal areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in cats and dogs following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid at doses between 250 to 1,600 mg/kg/day (1.6 to 22 times the recommended usual human dose based on body surface area) from 6 days to 1 year. No retinal changes have been observed in eye examinations of patients treated with tranexamic acid for up to 8 years. Patients expected to be treated for greater than 3 months may consider ophthalmic monitoring including visual acuity and optical coherence tomography at regular intervals. Discontinue tranexamic acid injection if changes in ophthalmological examination occurs. 5.6 Dizziness Tranexamic acid injection may cause dizziness. Concomitant use of other drugs that may also cause dizziness may worsen this effect. Advise patients to avoid driving or using machines until they know how tranexamic acid injection affects them."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur and may resolve with dose-reduction. Allergic dermatitis and giddiness have been reported. Hypotension has been reported when intravenous injection is too rapid. Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery, vein obstruction and cases associated with concomitant use of combination hormonal contraceptives) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion, cromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data) . Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of tranexamic acid injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of tranexamic acid injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision. Data Human Data Tranexamic acid passes through the placenta. The concentration in cord blood after an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg to pregnant women is about 30 mg/L, as high as in the maternal blood. There were 13 clinical studies that described fetal and/or neonatal functional issues such as low Apgar score, neonatal sepsis, cephalohematoma and 9 clinical studies that discussed alterations to growth including low birth weight and preterm birth at 22 to 36 weeks of gestation in fetuses and infants exposed to tranexamic acid in-utero. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, tranexamic acid was administered to pregnant mice from Gestation Day (GD) 6 through GD 12 and rats from GD 9 through GD 14 at daily doses of 0.3 or 1.5 g/kg. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in mice and rats at multiple of 3 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area in the mouse and rat, respectively. In rabbits, tranexamic acid was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day or orally at doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through GD 18. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at dose multiples of 2 or 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. Intravenous doses of 200 mg/kg/day showed slightly retarded weight gain in pregnant rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports the presence of tranexamic acid in human milk. There are no data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tranexamic acid injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tranexamic acid injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Concomitant use of tranexamic acid injection, which is an antifibrinolytic, with hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (nonhormonal) contraceptive method [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are limited data concerning the use of tranexamic acid injection in pediatric patients with hemophilia who are undergoing tooth extraction. The limited data suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between adults and pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tranexamic acid injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dosage of tranexamic acid injection in patients with renal impairment, based on the patient's serum creatinine [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interaction Studies No studies of interactions between tranexamic acid and other drugs have been conducted."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Tranexamic acid was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in rats and mice at oral doses up to 3 and 5.3 g/kg/day, which are approximately 12 and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Tranexamic acid was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial (Ames) test, and in vitro and in vivo cytogenetic test. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, tranexamic acid was administered to male rats as 0.3% and 1% of drug in diet (average doses of 222 and 856 mg/kg/day) or to female rats at dose levels of 0.3% and 1.2% of drug in diet. Tranexamic acid had no effect on fertility or reproductive function of male or female rats at dose multiples of 4 or 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies have shown a retinal toxicity associated with tranexamic acid. Toxicity is characterized by retinal atrophy commencing with changes to the retinal pigmented epithelium and progressing to retinal detachment in cats. The toxicity appears to be dose related, and changes are partially reversible at lower doses. Effects were observed in dogs at oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day and higher (multiple of 11 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area), and in cats at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days (multiple of 1.6 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Some fully reversible changes in pigmentation were observed in cats at doses of 125 mg/kg/day (multiple of 0.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area). Studies suggest that the underlying mechanism may be related to a transient retinal ischemia at high exposures, linked to the known sympathomimetic effect of high plasma exposures of tranexamic acid."
