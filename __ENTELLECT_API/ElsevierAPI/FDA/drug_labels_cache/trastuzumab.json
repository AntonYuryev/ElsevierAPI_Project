    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute KADCYLA for or with trastuzumab. HER2 Testing: Perform using FDA-approved tests by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. ( 2.1 ) For intravenous infusion only . Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. Do not use Dextrose (5%) solution. ( 2.4 ) The recommended dose of KADCYLA is 3.6 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (21-day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or a total of 14 cycles for patients with EBC. Do not administer KADCYLA at doses greater than 3.6 mg/kg. ( 2.2 ) Management of adverse reactions (infusion-related reactions, hepatotoxicity, left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary toxicity or peripheral neuropathy) may require temporary interruption, dose reduction, or treatment discontinuation of KADCYLA. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Patient Selection Select patients based on HER2 protein overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in tumor specimens [see Indications and Usage (1) , Clinical Studies (14) ]. Assessment of HER2 protein overexpression and/or HER2 gene amplification should be performed using FDA-approved tests specific for breast cancers by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. Information on the FDA-approved tests for the detection of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. Improper assay performance, including use of sub-optimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents, deviation from specific assay instructions, and failure to include appropriate controls for assay validation, can lead to unreliable results. 2.2 Recommended Doses and Schedules Do not substitute trastuzumab for or with KADCYLA. The recommended dose of KADCYLA is 3.6 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (21-day cycle). Do not administer KADCYLA at doses greater than 3.6 mg/kg . Closely monitor the infusion site for possible subcutaneous infiltration during drug administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . First infusion: Administer infusion over 90 minutes. Observe patients during the infusion and for at least 90 minutes following the initial dose for fever, chills, or other infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Subsequent infusions: Administer over 30 minutes if prior infusions were well tolerated. Observe patients during the infusion and for at least 30 minutes after infusion. Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) Patients with MBC should receive treatment until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity. Early Breast Cancer (EBC) Patients with EBC should receive treatment for a total of 14 cycles unless there is disease recurrence or unmanageable toxicity. 2.3 Dose Modifications Do not re-escalate the KADCYLA dose after a dose reduction is made. If a planned dose is delayed or missed, administer as soon as possible; do not wait until the next planned cycle. Adjust the schedule of administration to maintain a 3-week interval between doses. Administer the infusion at the dose and rate the patient tolerated in the most recent infusion. Slow or interrupt the infusion rate of KADCYLA if the patient develops an infusion-related reaction. Permanently discontinue KADCYLA for life-threatening infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Management of increased serum transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, left ventricular dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary toxicity or peripheral neuropathy may require temporary interruption, dose reduction or treatment discontinuation of KADCYLA as per guidelines provided in Tables 1 and 2 .

Administration: Administer KADCYLA as an intravenous infusion only with a 0.2 or 0.22 micron in-line polyethersulfone (PES) filter. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. Do not mix KADCYLA, or administer as an infusion, with other medicinal products. Reconstitution: Use aseptic technique for reconstitution and preparation of dosing solution. Appropriate procedures for the preparation of chemotherapeutic drugs should be used. Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection or 0.45% sodium chloride into the 100 mg KADCYLA vial, or 8 mL of Sterile Water for Injection or 0.45% sodium chloride into the 160 mg KADCYLA vial to yield a solution containing 20 mg/mL. Swirl the vial gently until completely dissolved. Do not shake. Inspect the reconstituted solution for particulates and discoloration. The reconstituted solution should be clear to slightly opalescent and free of visible particulates. The color of the reconstituted solution should be colorless to pale brown. Do not use if the reconstituted solution contains visible particulates or is cloudy or discolored. The reconstituted lyophilized vials should be used immediately following reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection or 0.45% sodium chloride. If not used immediately, the reconstituted KADCYLA vials can be stored for up to 120 hours (5 days) in a refrigerator at 2\u00baC to 8\u00baC (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F); discard unused KADCYLA after 120 hours (5 days) if stored at 2\u00baC to 8\u00baC (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). Do not freeze. The reconstituted product contains no preservative and is intended for single-dose only. Dilution: Determine the correct dose (mg) of KADCYLA [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Calculate the volume of the 20 mg/mL reconstituted KADCYLA solution needed. Withdraw this amount from the vial and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. Do not use Dextrose (5%) solution. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution in order to avoid foaming. The diluted KADCYLA infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used immediately, the solution may be stored in a refrigerator at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 24 hours prior to use. This storage time is additional to the time allowed for the reconstituted vials. Do not freeze or shake."

Permanently discontinue KADCYLA for life threatening infusion-related reaction. ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 5.5 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases of hemorrhage occurred in clinical trials among patients with no known identified risk factors, as well as among patients with thrombocytopenia and those receiving anti-coagulation and antiplatelet therapy. Use caution with these agents and consider additional monitoring when concomitant use is medically necessary . ( 5.6 ) Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet counts prior to each KADCYLA dose. Institute dose modifications as appropriate. ( 2.2 , 5.7 ) Neurotoxicity: Monitor for signs or symptoms. Withhold dosing temporarily for patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy. ( 2.2 , 5.8 , 13.2 ) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity, predominantly in the form of asymptomatic, transient increases in the concentrations of serum transaminases, has been observed in clinical trials with KADCYLA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Serious hepatotoxicity, including 3 fatal cases, has been observed in clinical trials (n=1624) with KADCYLA as single-agent. All fatal cases occurred in MBC clinical trials with KADCYLA, which included severe drug-induced liver injury and associated hepatic encephalopathy. Some of the patients experiencing hepatotoxicity had comorbidities and/or concomitant medications with known hepatotoxic potential. Monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin prior to initiation of KADCYLA treatment and prior to each KADCYLA dose. Patients with known active liver disease (such as, hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus) were excluded from the EMILIA and KATHERINE studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Reduce the dose or discontinue KADCYLA as appropriate in cases of increased serum transaminases and/or total bilirubin [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Permanently discontinue KADCYLA treatment in patients with serum transaminases > 3 \u00d7 ULN and concomitant total bilirubin > 2 \u00d7 ULN. KADCYLA has not been studied in patients with serum transaminases > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN or bilirubin > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN prior to the initiation of treatment. In clinical trials of KADCYLA, cases of nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver have been identified from liver biopsies (5 cases out of 1624 treated patients, one of which was fatal). Two of these five cases of NRH were observed in EMILIA and two were observed in KATHERINE [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . NRH is a rare liver condition characterized by widespread benign transformation of hepatic parenchyma into small regenerative nodules; NRH may lead to non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. The diagnosis of NRH can be confirmed only by histopathology. NRH should be considered in all patients with clinical symptoms of portal hypertension and/or cirrhosis-like pattern seen on the computed tomography (CT) scan of the liver but with normal transaminases and no other manifestations of cirrhosis. Upon diagnosis of NRH, KADCYLA treatment must be permanently discontinued. 5.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction Patients treated with KADCYLA are at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. A decrease of LVEF to < 40% has been observed in patients treated with KADCYLA. Serious cases of heart failure, with no fatal cases, have been observed in clinical trials with KADCYLA. In EMILIA, left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1.8% of patients in the KADCYLA-treated group and 3.3% of patients in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group. In KATHERINE, left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 0.4% of patients in the KADCYLA-treated group and 0.6% of patients in the trastuzumab-treated group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Based on limited data from a retrospective observational study, 22% (7 of 32) of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with a baseline LVEF of 40-49% treated with KADCYLA developed a congestive heart failure (CHF) or a > 10% reduction in LVEF [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of KADCYLA and at regular intervals (e.g. every three months) during treatment to ensure the LVEF is within the institution's normal limits. KADCYLA has not been studied in an adequately controlled study in patients with LVEF < 50%. For patients with MBC, if, at routine monitoring, LVEF is < 40%, or is 40% to 45% with a 10% or greater absolute decrease below the pretreatment value, withhold KADCYLA and repeat LVEF assessment within approximately 3 weeks. Permanently discontinue KADCYLA if the LVEF has not improved or has declined further. For patients with EBC, if, at routine monitoring, LVEF is < 45%, or is 45% to 49% with a 10% or greater absolute decrease below the pretreatment value, withhold KADCYLA and repeat LVEF assessment within approximately 3 weeks. Permanently discontinue KADCYLA if the LVEF has not improved or has declined further [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Patients with a history of symptomatic CHF, serious cardiac arrhythmia, or history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months were excluded from the EMILIA and KATHERINE studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity KADCYLA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Cases of oligohydramnios, and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities and neonatal death were observed in the post-marketing setting in patients treated with trastuzumab, the antibody component of KADCYLA. DM1, the cytotoxic component of KADCYLA, can cause embryo-fetal toxicity based on its mechanism of action. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of KADCYLA. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to KADCYLA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of KADCYLA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]. 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, some leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome or fatal outcome have been reported in clinical trials with KADCYLA. Signs and symptoms include dyspnea, cough, fatigue, and pulmonary infiltrates. In patients with MBC, pneumonitis was reported at an incidence of 0.8% (7 out of 884 treated patients), with one case of Grade 3 pneumonitis. The overall incidence of pneumonitis was 1.2% in EMILIA. In KATHERINE, pneumonitis was reported at an incidence of 1.1% (8 out of 740 patients treated with KADCYLA), with one case of Grade 3 pneumonitis. Radiation pneumonitis was reported at an incidence of 1.8% (11 out of 623 patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy and KADCYLA), with 2 cases of Grade 3 radiation pneumonitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Permanently discontinue treatment with KADCYLA in patients diagnosed with ILD or pneumonitis. For patients with radiation pneumonitis in the adjuvant setting, KADCYLA should be permanently discontinued for Grade \u2265 3 or for Grade 2 not responding to standard treatment [see Dose Modifications (2.3) ] . Patients with dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy, co-morbidities, and receiving concurrent pulmonary radiation therapy may be at increased risk of pulmonary toxicity. 5.5 Infusion-Related Reactions, Hypersensitivity Reactions Treatment with KADCYLA has not been studied in patients who had trastuzumab permanently discontinued due to infusion-related reactions (IRRs) and/or hypersensitivity; treatment with KADCYLA is not recommended for these patients. Infusion-related reactions, characterized by one or more of the following symptoms \u2212 flushing, chills, pyrexia, dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, and tachycardia have been reported in clinical trials of KADCYLA. In EMILIA, the overall incidence of IRRs in patients treated with KADCYLA was 1.4%. In KATHERINE, the overall incidence of IRRs in patients treated with KADCYLA was 1.6% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In most patients, these reactions resolved over the course of several hours to a day after the infusion was terminated. KADCYLA treatment should be interrupted in patients with severe IRR. KADCYLA treatment should be permanently discontinued in the event of a life-threatening IRR [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Patients should be observed closely for IRR reactions, especially during the first infusion. One case of a serious, allergic/anaphylactic-like reaction has been observed in clinical trials of single-agent KADCYLA. Medications to treat such reactions, as well as emergency equipment, should be available for immediate use. 5.6 Hemorrhage Cases of hemorrhagic events, including central nervous system, respiratory, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, have been reported in clinical trials with KADCYLA. Some of these bleeding events resulted in fatal outcomes. In EMILIA, the overall incidence of hemorrhage was 32% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 16% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group. The incidence of Grade \u2265 3 hemorrhage was 1.8% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 0.8% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group. In KATHERINE, the overall incidence of hemorrhage was 29% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 10% in the trastuzumab-treated group. The incidence of Grade \u2265 3 hemorrhage was 0.4% in the KADCYLA-treated group, with one fatal case of intracranial hemorrhage, and 0.3% in the trastuzumab-treated group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Although, in some of the observed cases the patients were also receiving anti-coagulation therapy, antiplatelet therapy, or had thrombocytopenia, in others there were no known additional risk factors. Use caution with these agents and consider additional monitoring when concomitant use is medically necessary. 5.7 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia, or decreased platelet count, was reported in clinical trials of KADCYLA (145 of 1624 treated patients with Grade \u2265 3; 494 of 1624 treated patients with any Grade). The majority of these patients had Grade 1 or 2 events (< LLN to \u2265 50,000/mm 3 ) with the nadir occurring by day 8 and generally improving to Grade 0 or 1 (\u2265 75,000/mm 3 ) by the next scheduled dose. In clinical trials of KADCYLA, the incidence and severity of thrombocytopenia were higher in Asian patients. In EMILIA, the overall incidence of thrombocytopenia was 31% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 3.3% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The incidence of Grade \u2265 3 thrombocytopenia was 15% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 0.4% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group. In Asian patients, the incidence of Grade \u2265 3 thrombocytopenia was 45% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 1.3% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group. In KATHERINE, the overall incidence of thrombocytopenia was 29% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 2.4% in the trastuzumab-treated group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The incidence of Grade \u2265 3 thrombocytopenia was 6% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 0.3% in the trastuzumab-treated group. In Asian patients, the incidence of Grade \u2265 3 thrombocytopenia was 19% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 0% in the trastuzumab-treated group. The overall incidence of thrombocytopenia in the KADCYLA-treated group for Asian patients was 50%. Monitor platelet counts prior to initiation of KADCYLA and prior to each KADCYLA dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . KADCYLA has not been studied in patients with platelet counts < 100,000/mm 3 prior to initiation of treatment. In the event of decreased platelet count to Grade \u2265 3 (< 50,000/mm 3 ) do not administer KADCYLA until platelet counts recover to Grade 1 (\u2265 75,000/mm 3 ) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Closely monitor patients with thrombocytopenia (< 100,000/mm 3 ) and patients on anti-coagulant treatment during treatment with KADCYLA. 5.8 Neurotoxicity Peripheral neuropathy, mainly as Grade 1 and predominantly sensory, was reported in clinical trials of KADCYLA (26 of 1624 treated patients with Grade \u2265 3; 435 of 1624 treated patients with any Grade). In EMILIA, the overall incidence of peripheral neuropathy was 21% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 14% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The incidence of Grade \u2265 3 peripheral neuropathy was 2.2% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 0.2% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group. In KATHERINE, the overall incidence of peripheral neuropathy was 32% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 17% in the trastuzumab-treated group. Peripheral neuropathy, including sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy, for KADCYLA treated patients 30% of cases were not resolved at the time of the primary IDFS analysis for KATHERINE. The incidence of Grade \u2265 3 peripheral neuropathy was 1.6% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 0.1% in the trastuzumab-treated group. KADCYLA should be temporarily discontinued in patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy until resolution to Grade \u2264 2. Patients should be clinically monitored on an ongoing basis for signs or symptoms of neurotoxicity [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . 5.9 Extravasation In KADCYLA clinical studies, reactions secondary to extravasation have been observed. These reactions, observed more frequently within 24 hours of infusion, were usually mild and comprised erythema, tenderness, skin irritation, pain, or swelling at the infusion site. Specific treatment for KADCYLA extravasation is unknown. The infusion site should be closely monitored for possible subcutaneous infiltration during drug administration."

( 6.1 ) Early Breast Cancer The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 25%) with KADCYLA were fatigue, nausea, increased transaminases, musculoskeletal pain, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, headache, peripheral neuropathy, and arthralgia. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to KADCYLA as a single agent at 3.6 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (21-day cycle) in 1624 patients including 884 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and 740 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer (KATHERINE trial). Metastatic Breast Cancer In clinical trials, KADCYLA has been evaluated as single-agent in 884 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The most common (\u2265 25%) adverse reactions were fatigue, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, headache, increased transaminases, constipation and epistaxis. The adverse reactions described in Table 3 were identified in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated in the EMILIA trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients were randomized to receive KADCYLA or lapatinib plus capecitabine. The median duration of study treatment was 7.6 months for patients in the KADCYLA-treated group and 5.5 months and 5.3 months for patients treated with lapatinib and capecitabine, respectively. In the EMILIA trial, 43% of patients experienced Grade \u2265 3 adverse reactions in the KADCYLA-treated group compared with 59% of patients in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group. Dose adjustments for KADCYLA were permitted [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Thirty-two patients (7%) discontinued KADCYLA due to an adverse reaction, compared with 41 patients (8%) who discontinued lapatinib, and 51 patients (10%) who discontinued capecitabine due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to KADCYLA discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and increased transaminases. Eighty patients (16%) treated with KADCYLA had adverse reactions leading to dose reductions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reduction of KADCYLA (in \u2265 1% of patients) included thrombocytopenia, increased transaminases, and peripheral neuropathy. Adverse reactions that led to dose delays occurred in 116 (24%) of KADCYLA treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to a dose delay of KADCYLA (in \u2265 1% of patients) were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, fatigue, increased transaminases and pyrexia. Table 3 reports the adverse reactions that occurred in patients in the KADCYLA-treated group (n=490) of the EMILIA trial. Selected laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 4 . The most common adverse reactions seen with KADCYLA in the randomized trial (frequency > 25%) were nausea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, increased transaminases, headache, and constipation. The most common NCI\u2013CTCAE (version 3) Grade \u2265 3 adverse reactions (frequency > 2%) were thrombocytopenia, increased transaminases, anemia, hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and fatigue.

The adverse reactions described in Table 5 were identified in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer treated in the KATHERINE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Patients were randomized to receive KADCYLA or trastuzumab. The median duration of study treatment was 10 months for patients in the KADCYLA-treated group and 10 months for patients treated with trastuzumab. One hundred and ninety (26%) patients experienced Grade \u2265 3 adverse reactions in the KADCYLA-treated group compared with 111 (15%) patients in the trastuzumab group. One hundred and thirty-three patients (18%) discontinued KADCYLA due to an adverse reaction, compared with 15 patients (2.1%) who discontinued trastuzumab due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to KADCYLA discontinuation (in \u2265 1% of patients) were platelet count decreased, blood bilirubin increased, ejection fraction decreased, AST increased, ALT increased, and peripheral neuropathy. Dose adjustments for KADCYLA were permitted [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . One hundred and six patients (14%) treated with KADCYLA had dose reductions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reduction of KADCYLA (in \u2265 1% of patients) included thrombocytopenia, increased transaminases, blood bilirubin and fatigue. Adverse reactions that led to dose delays occurred in 106 (14%) of KADCYLA treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to a dose delay of KADCYLA (in \u2265 1% of patients) were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and AST increased. Selected laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 6 . The most common adverse reactions seen with KADCYLA in the randomized trial (frequency > 25%) were fatigue, nausea, increased transaminases, musculoskeletal pain, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, headache, peripheral neuropathy, and arthralgia. The most common NCI\u2013CTCAE (version 3) Grade \u2265 3 adverse reactions (> 2%) were thrombocytopenia and hypertension.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies with KADCYLA have been conducted. In vitro studies indicate that DM1, the cytotoxic component of KADCYLA, is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, and voriconazole) with KADCYLA should be avoided due to the potential for an increase in DM1 exposure and toxicity. Consider an alternate medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4. If concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is unavoidable, consider delaying KADCYLA treatment until the strong CYP3A4 inhibitors have cleared from the circulation (approximately 3 elimination half-lives of the inhibitors) when possible. If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is coadministered and KADCYLA treatment cannot be delayed, patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Verify pregnancy status of females prior to initiation of KADCYLA. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy If KADCYLA is administered during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving KADCYLA or within 7 months following the last dose of KADCYLA, health care providers and patients should immediately report KADCYLA exposure to Genentech at 1-888-835-2555. Risk Summary KADCYLA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of KADCYLA in pregnant women. Cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death were observed in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with trastuzumab, the antibody component of KADCYLA [see Data ] . Based on its mechanism of action, the DM1 component of KADCYLA can also cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Data ]. Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if KADCYLA is used in a pregnant woman, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of KADCYLA [see Clinical Considerations ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received KADCYLA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. Data Human Data There are no available data on the use of KADCYLA in pregnant women. In the post-marketing setting, cases of oligohydramnios, and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting in the fetus as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities and neonatal death were observed after treatment with trastuzumab during pregnancy. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received trastuzumab either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In some case reports, amniotic fluid index increased after trastuzumab was stopped. In one case, trastuzumab therapy resumed after amniotic index improved, and oligohydramnios recurred. Animal Data There were no reproductive and developmental toxicology studies conducted with ado-trastuzumab emtansine. DM1, the cytotoxic component of KADCYLA, disrupts microtubule function. DM1 is toxic to rapidly dividing cells in animals and is genotoxic, suggesting it has the potential to cause embryotoxicity and teratogenicity. In studies where trastuzumab was administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (about 7 times the clinical dose), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early (Gestation Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation. The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of ado-trastuzumab emtansine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. DM1, the cytotoxic component of KADCYLA, may cause serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants based on its mechanism of action [see Data ] . Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of KADCYLA. Data There were no animal lactation studies conducted with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or the cytotoxic component of KADCYLA (DM1). In lactating cynomolgus monkeys, trastuzumab was present in breast milk at about 0.3% of maternal serum concentrations after pre- (beginning Gestation Day 120) and post-partum (through Post-partum Day 28) doses of 25 mg/kg administered twice weekly (about 7 times the clinical dose of KADCYLA). Infant monkeys with detectable serum levels of trastuzumab did not exhibit any adverse effects on growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of KADCYLA. Contraception Females KADCYLA can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of KADCYLA [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KADCYLA and for 4 months following the last dose. Infertility Based on results from animal toxicity studies, KADCYLA may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known if the effects are reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of KADCYLA have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 495 patients who were randomized to KADCYLA in EMILIA [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] , 65 patients (13%) were \u2265 65 years of age and 11 patients (2%) were \u2265 75 years of age. In patients \u2265 65 years old (n=138 across both treatment arms) the hazard ratios for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 1.06 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.66) and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.58, 1.91), respectively. No overall differences in the safety of KADCYLA were observed in patients aged \u2265 65 compared to patients < 65 years of age. EMILIA did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged \u2265 75 years to draw conclusions on the safety or effectiveness of KADCYLA in this age group. Of the 743 patients who were randomized to KADCYLA in KATHERINE [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] , 58 patients (8%) were \u2265 65 years of age and 2 patients (0.3%) were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in the safety or effectiveness of KADCYLA were observed in patients aged \u2265 65 compared to patients < 65 years of age. KATHERINE did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged \u2265 75 years to draw conclusions on the safety or effectiveness of KADCYLA in this age group. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that age does not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of ado-trastuzumab emtansine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dedicated renal impairment trial for KADCYLA has been conducted. Based on the population pharmacokinetics, as well as analysis of Grade 3 or greater adverse reactions and dose modifications, dose adjustments of KADCYLA are not needed in patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 60 to 89 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr 30 to 59 mL/min) renal impairment. No dose adjustment can be recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr less than 30 mL/min) because of the limited data available [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No adjustment to the starting dose is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . KADCYLA was not studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Closely monitor patients with hepatic impairment due to known hepatotoxicity observed with KADCYLA [ see Warnings and Precautions, Hepatotoxicity (5.1) ]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy If KADCYLA is administered during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving KADCYLA or within 7 months following the last dose of KADCYLA, health care providers and patients should immediately report KADCYLA exposure to Genentech at 1-888-835-2555. Risk Summary KADCYLA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of KADCYLA in pregnant women. Cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death were observed in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with trastuzumab, the antibody component of KADCYLA [see Data ] . Based on its mechanism of action, the DM1 component of KADCYLA can also cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Data ]. Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if KADCYLA is used in a pregnant woman, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of KADCYLA [see Clinical Considerations ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received KADCYLA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. Data Human Data There are no available data on the use of KADCYLA in pregnant women. In the post-marketing setting, cases of oligohydramnios, and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting in the fetus as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities and neonatal death were observed after treatment with trastuzumab during pregnancy. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received trastuzumab either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In some case reports, amniotic fluid index increased after trastuzumab was stopped. In one case, trastuzumab therapy resumed after amniotic index improved, and oligohydramnios recurred. Animal Data There were no reproductive and developmental toxicology studies conducted with ado-trastuzumab emtansine. DM1, the cytotoxic component of KADCYLA, disrupts microtubule function. DM1 is toxic to rapidly dividing cells in animals and is genotoxic, suggesting it has the potential to cause embryotoxicity and teratogenicity. In studies where trastuzumab was administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (about 7 times the clinical dose), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early (Gestation Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation. The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION KADCYLA (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) is a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) which contains the humanized anti-HER2 IgG1, trastuzumab, covalently linked to the microtubule inhibitory drug DM1 (a maytansine derivative) via the stable thioether linker MCC (4-[N-maleimidomethyl] cyclohexane-1-carboxylate). Emtansine refers to the MCC-DM1 complex. The antibody trastuzumab, is a well characterized recombinant monoclonal antibody product produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the small molecule components (DM1 and MCC) are produced by chemical synthesis. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine contains an average of 3.5 DM1 molecules per antibody. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine has the following chemical structure: Note: The bracketed structure is DM1 plus MCC which represents the emtansine component. The n is, on average, 3.5 DM1 molecules per trastuzumab (Mab) molecule. KADCYLA (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) is a sterile, white to off-white preservative free lyophilized powder in single-dose vials. Each vial contains 100 mg or 160 mg ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Following reconstitution, each single-dose vial contains ado-trastuzumab emtansine (20 mg/mL), polysorbate 20 [0.02% (w/v)], sodium succinate (10 mM), and sucrose [6% (w/v)] with a pH of 5.0. The resulting solution containing 20 mg/mL ado-trastuzumab emtansine is administered by intravenous infusion following dilution. Chemical Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate. The antibody is the humanized anti-HER2 IgG1, trastuzumab. The small molecule cytotoxin, DM1, is a microtubule inhibitor. Upon binding to sub-domain IV of the HER2 receptor, ado-trastuzumab emtansine undergoes receptor-mediated internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation, resulting in intracellular release of DM1-containing cytotoxic catabolites. Binding of DM1 to tubulin disrupts microtubule networks in the cell, which results in cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that similar to trastuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine inhibits HER2 receptor signaling, mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and inhibits shedding of the HER2 extracellular domain in human breast cancer cells that overexpress HER2. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of multiple doses of KADCYLA (3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open label, single arm study in 51 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. No large changes in the mean QT interval (i.e., > 20 ms) were detected in the study. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of KADCYLA was evaluated in a phase 1 study and in a population pharmacokinetic analysis for the ado-trastuzumab emtansine conjugate (ADC) using pooled data from 5 trials in patients with breast cancer. A linear two-compartment model with first-order elimination from the central compartment adequately describes the ADC concentration-time profile. In addition to ADC, the pharmacokinetics of total antibody (conjugated and unconjugated trastuzumab), DM1 were also determined. The population pharmacokinetic analysis of ADC suggested no difference in KADCYLA exposure based on disease status (adjuvant vs. metastatic setting). The pharmacokinetics of KADCYLA are summarized below. Distribution Maximum concentrations (C max ) of ADC and DM1 were observed close to the end of infusion. In EMILIA, mean (SD) ADC and DM1 Cycle 1 C max following KADCYLA administration was 83.4 (16.5) \u00b5g/mL and 4.61 (1.61) ng/mL, respectively. In KATHERINE, mean (SD) ADC and DM1 Cycle 1 C max following KADCYLA administration was 72.6 (24.3) \u00b5g/mL and 4.71 (2.25) ng/mL, respectively. In vitro , the mean binding of DM1 to human plasma proteins was 93%. In vitro, DM1 was a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the central volume of distribution of ADC was 3.13 L. Metabolism In vitro studies indicate that DM1, the small molecule component of KADCYLA, undergoes metabolism by CYP3A4/5. DM1 did not inhibit or induce major CYP450 enzymes in vitro. In human plasma, ado-trastuzumab emtansine catabolites MCC-DM1, Lys-MCC-DM1, and DM1 were detected at low levels. Elimination Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following intravenous infusion of KADCYLA, the clearance of the ADC was 0.68 L/day and the elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) was approximately 4 days. No accumulation of KADCYLA was observed after repeated dosing of intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis (n=671), body weight, sum of longest diameter of target lesions by RECIST, HER2 extracellular domain (ECD) concentrations, AST, albumin, and baseline trastuzumab concentrations were identified as statistically significant covariates for ado-trastuzumab emtansine clearance. However, the magnitude of effect of these covariates on ado-trastuzumab emtansine exposure suggests that, with the exception of body weight, these covariates are unlikely to have a clinically meaningful effect on KADCYLA exposure. Therefore, the body weight based dose of 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks without correction for other covariates is considered appropriate. Effect of Renal Impairment Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis in 668 patients, including moderate (CLcr 30 - 59 mL/min, n=53) and mild (CLcr 60 - 89 mL/min, n=254) renal impairment, indicate that pharmacokinetics of the ADC is not affected by mild to moderate renal impairment as compared to normal renal function (CLcr \u2265 90 mL/min, n=361). Data from only one patient with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) is available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Effect of Hepatic Impairment The liver is a primary organ for eliminating DM1 and DM1-containing catabolites. The pharmacokinetics of ado-trastuzumab emtansine and DM1-containing catabolites were evaluated after the administration of 3.6 mg/kg of KADCYLA to metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer patients with normal hepatic function (n=10), mild (Child-Pugh A; n=10) and moderate (Child-Pugh B; n=8) hepatic impairment. \u2013 Plasma concentrations of DM1 and DM1-containing catabolites (Lys-MCC-DM1 and MCC-DM1) were low and comparable between patients with and without hepatic impairment. \u2013 Systemic exposures (AUC) of ado-trastuzumab emtansine at Cycle 1 in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment were approximately 38% and 67% lower than that of patients with normal hepatic function, respectively. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine exposure (AUC) at Cycle 3 after repeated dosing in patients with mild or moderate hepatic dysfunction was within the range observed in patients with normal hepatic function. KADCYLA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). Effects of Age and Race Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age (< 65 [n=577]; 65 - 75 (n=78); > 75 [n=16]) and race (Asian [n=73]; non-Asian [n=598]) do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of ado-trastuzumab emtansine. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described below with the incidence of ADA in other studies, including those of ado-trastuzumab emtansine or of other ado-trastuzumab emtansine products. Among patients who received KADCYLA as a single agent for a median duration of 10 months in seven clinical trials, 5% (64/1243) of patients tested positive for antibodies against ado-trastuzumab emtansine at one or more post-dose timepoints. Neutralizing antibodies against ado-trastuzumab emtansine were detected in 45% (18/40) of evaluable patients who were ADA positive. Because of the low occurrence of ADA, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and/or effectiveness of ado-trastuzumab emtansine is unknown. The presence of ado-trastuzumab emtansine in patient serum at the time of ADA sampling may interfere with the ability of this assay to detect anti-ado-trastuzumab emtansine antibodies. As a result, data may not accurately reflect the true incidence of anti-ado-trastuzumab emtansine antibody development."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Metastatic Breast Cancer The efficacy of KADCYLA was evaluated in a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial (EMILIA) (NCT00829166) of 991 patients with HER2-positive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Prior taxane and trastuzumab-based therapy was required before trial enrollment. Patients with only prior adjuvant therapy were required to have disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant therapy. Breast tumor samples were required to show HER2 overexpression defined as 3+ IHC or FISH amplification ratio \u2265 2.0 determined at a central laboratory. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive lapatinib plus capecitabine or KADCYLA. Randomization was stratified by world region (United States, Western Europe, other), number of prior chemotherapy regimens for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease (0\u20131, > 1) and visceral versus non-visceral disease as determined by the investigators. KADCYLA was given intravenously at 3.6 mg/kg on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Lapatinib was administered at 1250 mg/day orally once per day of a 21-day cycle and capecitabine was administered at 1000 mg/m 2 orally twice daily on Days 1\u221214 of a 21-day cycle. Patients were treated with KADCYLA or lapatinib plus capecitabine until progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. At the time of the primary analysis, median time on study drug was 5.7 months (range: 0\u201328.4) for KADCYLA, 4.9 months (range: 0\u201330.8) for lapatinib, and 4.8 months (range: 0\u201330.4) for capecitabine. The co-primary efficacy outcomes of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) based on tumor response assessments by an independent review committee (IRC), and overall survival (OS). PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurred earlier). Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Additional outcomes included PFS (based on investigator tumor response assessments), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response and time to symptom progression. Patient demographics and baseline tumor characteristics were balanced between treatment arms. All patients had metastatic disease at study entry. The median age was approximately 53 years (range 24-84 years), 74% were White, 18% were Asian and 5% were Black. All but 5 patients were women. Twenty-seven percent of patients were enrolled in United States, 32% in Europe and 16% in Asia. Tumor prognostic characteristics including hormone receptor status (positive: 55%, negative: 43%), presence of visceral disease (68%) and non-visceral disease only (33%) and the number of metastatic sites (< 3: 61%, \u2265 3: 37%) were similar in the study arms. The majority of patients (88%) had received prior systemic treatment in the metastatic setting. Twelve percent of patients had prior treatment only in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and had disease relapse within 6 months of treatment. All but one patient received trastuzumab prior to study entry; approximately 85% of patients received prior trastuzumab in the metastatic setting. Over 99% percent of patients had received a taxane, and 61% of patients had received an anthracycline prior to study entry. Overall, patients received a median of 3 systemic agents in the metastatic setting. Among patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors, 44.4% received prior adjuvant hormonal therapy and 44.8% received hormonal therapy for locally advanced/metastatic disease. The randomized trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in IRC-assessed PFS in the KADCYLA-treated group compared with the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.77, p < 0.0001], and an increase in median PFS of 3.2 months (median PFS of 9.6 months in the KADCYLA-treated group vs. 6.4 months in the lapatinib plus capecitabine group). See Table 7 and Figure 1 . The results for investigator-assessed PFS were similar to those observed for IRC-assessed PFS. At the time of PFS analysis, 223 patients had died. More deaths occurred in the lapatinib plus capecitabine arm (26%) compared with the KADCYLA arm (19%), however the results of this interim OS analysis did not meet the pre-specified stopping boundary for statistical significance. At the time of the second interim OS analysis, 331 events had occurred. The co-primary endpoint of OS was met; OS was significantly improved in patients receiving KADCYLA (HR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.85, p = 0.0006). This result crossed the pre-specified efficacy stopping boundary (HR = 0.73 or p = 0.0037). The median duration of survival was 30.9 months in the KADCYLA arm vs. 25.1 months in the lapatinib plus capecitabine arm. See Table 7 and Figure 2 . A treatment benefit with KADCYLA in terms of PFS and OS was observed in patient subgroups based on stratification factors, key baseline demographic and disease characteristics, and prior treatments. In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (n=426), the hazard ratios for PFS and OS were 0.56 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.72) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.03), respectively. In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (n=545), the hazard ratios for PFS and OS were 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.91) and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.85), respectively. In the subgroup of patients with non-measurable disease (n=205), based on IRC assessments, the hazard ratios for PFS and OS were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.42) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.68), respectively; in patients with measurable disease the hazard ratios were 0.62 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.75) and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.82), respectively. The PFS and OS hazard ratios in patients who were younger than 65 years old (n=853) were 0.62 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.74) and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.83), respectively. In patients \u2265 65 years old (n=138), the hazard ratios for PFS and OS were 1.06 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.66) and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.58, 1.91), respectively.

Patients were required to have had neoadjuvant taxane and trastuzumab-based therapy with residual invasive tumor in the breast and/or axillary lymph nodes. Patients received radiotherapy and/or hormonal therapy concurrent with study treatment as per local guidelines. Breast tumor samples were required to show HER2 overexpression defined as 3+ IHC or ISH amplification ratio \u2265 2.0 determined at a central laboratory using Ventana's PATHWAY anti-HER2-/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody or INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail assays. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive KADCYLA or trastuzumab. Randomization was stratified by clinical stage at presentation, hormone receptor status, preoperative HER2-directed therapy (trastuzumab, trastuzumab plus additional HER2-directed agent[s]), and pathological nodal status evaluation after preoperative therapy. KADCYLA was given intravenously at 3.6 mg/kg on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Trastuzumab was given intravenously at 6 mg/kg on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Patients were treated with KADCYLA or trastuzumab for a total of 14 cycles unless there was recurrence of disease, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. At the time of the major efficacy outcome analysis, median treatment duration was 10 months for both KADCYLA- and trastuzumab-treated patients. Patients who discontinued KADCYLA for reasons other than disease recurrence could complete the remainder of the planned HER2-directed therapy with trastuzumab if appropriate based on toxicity considerations and investigator discretion. The major efficacy outcome of the study was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS). IDFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to first occurrence of ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, ipsilateral local or regional invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant recurrence, contralateral invasive breast cancer, or death from any cause. Additional efficacy outcomes included IDFS including second primary non-breast cancer, disease free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Patient demographics and baseline tumor characteristics were generally balanced between treatment arms. The median age was approximately 49 years (range 23-80 years), 73% were White, 9% were Asian, 6% were American Indian or Alaska Native and 3% were Black or African American. Most patients (99.7%) were women. Enrollment by region was as follows: 23% in North America, 54% in Europe and 23% throughout the rest of the world. Tumor prognostic characteristics including hormone receptor status (positive: 72%, negative: 28%), clinical stage at presentation (inoperable: 25%, operable: 75%) and pathological nodal status after preoperative therapy (node positive: 46%, node negative or not evaluated: 54%) were similar across study arms. The majority of patients (77%) had received an anthracycline-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Twenty percent of patients received another HER2-targeted agent in addition to trastuzumab as a component of neoadjuvant therapy; 94% of these patients received pertuzumab. A statistically significant improvement in IDFS and OS was observed in patients who received KADCYLA compared with trastuzumab. The efficacy results from KATHERINE are summarized in Table 8, Figure 3, and Figure 4 .

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For subcutaneous use in the thigh only. ( 2.2 ) PHESGO has different dosage and administration instructions than intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab products. ( 2.2 ) Do not administer intravenously. ( 2.2 ) Perform HER2 testing using FDA-approved tests by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. ( 1 , 2.1 ) The initial dose of PHESGO is 1,200 mg pertuzumab, 600 mg trastuzumab, and 30,000 units hyaluronidase administered subcutaneously over approximately 8 minutes, followed every 3 weeks by a dose of 600 mg pertuzumab, 600 mg trastuzumab, and 20,000 units hyaluronidase administered subcutaneously over approximately 5 minutes. ( 2.2 ) Neoadjuvant: administer PHESGO by subcutaneous injection every 3 weeks and chemotherapy by intravenous infusion preoperatively for 3 to 6 cycles. ( 2.2 ) Adjuvant: administer PHESGO by subcutaneous injection every 3 weeks and chemotherapy by intravenous infusion postoperatively for a total of 1 year (up to 18 cycles). ( 2.2 ) MBC: administer PHESGO by subcutaneous injection and docetaxel by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Patient Selection Select patients based on HER2 protein overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in tumor specimens [see Indications and Usage (1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . Assessment of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification should be performed using FDA-approved tests specific for breast cancer by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. Information on the FDA-approved tests for the detection of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. Improper assay performance, including use of suboptimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents, deviation from specific assay instructions, and failure to include appropriate controls for assay validation, can lead to unreliable results. 2.2 Important Dosage and Administration Information PHESGO is for subcutaneous use only in the thigh. Do not administer intravenously. PHESGO has different dosage and administration instructions than intravenous pertuzumab, intravenous trastuzumab, and subcutaneous trastuzumab when administered alone. Do not substitute PHESGO for or with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. PHESGO must always be administered by a healthcare professional. In patients receiving an anthracycline-based regimen for early breast cancer, administer PHESGO following completion of the anthracycline. In patients receiving PHESGO for early breast cancer with docetaxel or paclitaxel, administer docetaxel or paclitaxel after PHESGO. In patients receiving PHESGO for metastatic breast cancer with docetaxel, administer docetaxel after PHESGO. Observe patients for a minimum of 30 minutes after initial dose of PHESGO and 15 minutes after each maintenance dose of PHESGO for signs or hypersensitivity symptoms or administration-related reactions. Medications to treat such reactions, as well as emergency equipment, should be available for immediate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 2.3 Recommended Doses and Schedules The recommended dosage and administration schedule for PHESGO are shown in Table 1 . Table 1: Recommended Dosage and Administration Schedule Dose Strength Administration Instructions Initial dose 1,200 mg pertuzumab, 600 mg trastuzumab, and 30,000 units hyaluronidase in 15 mL Administer subcutaneously over approximately 8 minutes (1,200 mg, 600 mg, and 30,000 units/15 mL) Maintenance dose (administer every 3 weeks) 600 mg pertuzumab, 600 mg trastuzumab, and 20,000 units hyaluronidase in 10 mL (600 mg, 600 mg, and 20,000 units/10 mL) Administer subcutaneously over approximately 5 minutes every 3 weeks No dose adjustments for PHESGO are required for patient body weight or for concomitant chemotherapy regimen. Patients currently receiving intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab can transition to PHESGO. In patients receiving intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab with < 6 weeks since their last dose, administer PHESGO as a maintenance dose of 600 mg pertuzumab/600 mg trastuzumab and every 3 weeks for subsequent administrations. In patients receiving intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab with \u2265 6 weeks since their last dose, administer PHESGO as an initial dose of 1,200 mg pertuzumab/600 mg trastuzumab, followed by a maintenance dose of 600 mg pertuzumab/600 mg trastuzumab every 3 weeks for subsequent administrations . Neoadjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer Administer PHESGO every 3 weeks for 3 to 6 cycles as part of a treatment regimen for early breast cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Refer to the prescribing information for pertuzumab, administered in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy, for recommended dose and dosage modifications. Following surgery, patients should continue to receive PHESGO to complete 1 year of treatment (up to 18 cycles) or until disease recurrence or unmanageable toxicity, whichever occurs first, as a part of a complete regimen for early breast cancer. Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer Administer PHESGO every 3 weeks for a total of 1 year (up to 18 cycles) or until disease recurrence or unmanageable toxicity, whichever occurs first, as part of a complete regimen for early breast cancer, including standard anthracycline- and/or taxane-based chemotherapy. Start PHESGO on Day 1 of the first taxane-containing cycle [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) When administered with PHESGO, the recommended initial dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2 administered as an intravenous infusion. The dose may be escalated to 100 mg/m 2 administered every 3 weeks if the initial dose is well tolerated. Administer PHESGO until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity, whichever occurs first. 2.4 Dose Modification Dose Modification for Delayed or Missed Doses For delayed or missed doses of PHESGO, if the time between two sequential injections is less than 6 weeks, administer the maintenance dose of 600 mg, 600 mg, and 20,000 units/10 mL. Do not wait until the next planned dose. If the time between two sequential injections is 6 weeks or more, re-administer the initial dose of 1,200 mg, 600 mg, and 30,000 units/15 mL, followed every 3 weeks thereafter by a maintenance dose of 600 mg, 600 mg, and 20,000 units/10 mL. For chemotherapy dose modifications, see relevant prescribing information. Cardiomyopathy [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of PHESGO and at regular intervals during treatment as indicated in Table 2 . The recommendations on dose modifications in the event of LVEF dysfunction are indicated in Table 2 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Table 2: Dose Modifications for Left Ventricular Dysfunction Pre-treatment LVEF: Monitor LVEF every: Withhold PHESGO for at least 3 weeks for an LVEF decrease to: Resume PHESGO after 3 weeks if LVEF has recovered to: Early Breast Cancer \u2265 55% For patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy, a LVEF of \u2265 50% is required after completion of anthracyclines, before starting PHESGO ~12 weeks (once during neoadjuvant therapy) <50% with a fall of \u226510%-points below pre-treatment value Either \u226550% <10% points below pre-treatment value Metastatic Breast Cancer \u2265 50% ~12 weeks Either Either <40% 40%-45% with a fall of \u226510%-points below pre-treatment value >45% 40%-45% with a fall of <10%-points below pre-treatment value If after a repeat assessment within approximately 3 weeks, the LVEF has not improved, has declined further, and/or the patient is symptomatic, permanently discontinue PHESGO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Hypersensitivity and Administration-Related Reactions Discontinue the injection immediately if the patient experiences a serious hypersensitivity reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 2.5 Preparation for Administration To prevent medication errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the drug being prepared and administered is PHESGO and not intravenous pertuzumab, or intravenous trastuzumab, or subcutaneous trastuzumab. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use vial if particulates or discoloration is present. Do not shake. Discard any unused portion remaining in the vial. For both the initial and maintenance dose, each corresponding PHESGO vial is ready-to-use for one subcutaneous injection and should not be diluted. A syringe, a transfer needle, and an injection needle are needed to withdraw PHESGO solution from the vial and inject it subcutaneously. PHESGO may be injected using 25G-27G (3/8\"-5/8\") hypodermic injection needles. To avoid needle clogging, attach the hypodermic injection needle to the syringe immediately prior to administration followed by volume adjustment to 15 mL (initial dose) and 10 mL (maintenance dose). If the dose is not to be administered immediately, and the solution of PHESGO has been withdrawn from the vial into the syringe, replace the transfer needle with a syringe closing cap. Label the syringe with the peel-off sticker and store the syringe in the refrigerator [2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F)] for up to 24 hours and at room temperature [20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] for up to 4 hours and avoid unnecessary storage. PHESGO is compatible with stainless steel, polypropylene, polycarbonate, polyethylene, polyurethane, polyvinyl chloride and fluorinated ethylene polypropylene. Administration Administer PHESGO 1,200 mg, 600 mg, 30,000 units/15 mL subcutaneously over approximately 8 minutes Administer PHESGO 600 mg, 600 mg, 20,000 units/10 mL subcutaneously over approximately 5 minutes The subcutaneous injection site should be alternated between the left and right thigh only. New injections should be given at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the previous site on healthy skin and never into areas where the skin is red, bruised, tender, or hard. Do not split the dose between two syringes or between two sites of administration. During the treatment course with PHESGO, other medications for subcutaneous administration should preferably be injected at different sites."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia. ( 5.4 ) Hypersensitivity and Administration-Related Reactions (ARRs): Monitor patients for systemic hypersensitivity reactions. Permanently discontinue PHESGO in patients who experience anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Cardiomyopathy PHESGO can cause hypertension, arrhythmias, left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death [see Boxed Warning: Cardiomyopathy ]. PHESGO can cause asymptomatic decline in LVEF. An increased incidence of LVEF decline has been observed in patients treated with intravenous pertuzumab, intravenous trastuzumab, and docetaxel. A 4-6 fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction has been reported among patients receiving trastuzumab, with the highest absolute incidence occurring when trastuzumab was administered with an anthracycline. Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping PHESGO may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Cardiac Monitoring Prior to initiation of PHESGO, conduct a thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan. During treatment with PHESGO, assess LVEF at regular intervals [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. If after a repeat assessment within approximately 3 weeks, the LVEF has not improved, has declined further, and/or the patient is symptomatic, permanently discontinue PHESGO. Following completion of PHESGO, continue to monitor for cardiomyopathy and assess LVEF measurements every 6 months for at least 2 years as a component of adjuvant therapy. PHESGO In the FeDeriCa trial, the percentage of patients with at least one cardiac disorder was 22% in the PHESGO arm. The most frequent cardiac adverse reaction in the PHESGO arm was ejection fraction decreased. The incidence of cardiac failure (NYHA Class III/IV) with a LVEF decline \u2265 10% and a drop to less than 50% was 0.8% in the PHESGO arm. Confirmed asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (NYHA Class II) declines in LVEF \u2265 10% and a drop to less than 50% was 1.2% in the PHESGO arm [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . PHESGO and/or intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab have not been studied in patients with a pretreatment LVEF value of < 55% (EBC) or <50% (MBC); a prior history of CHF, conditions that could impair left ventricular function such as uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment or a cumulative prior anthracycline exposure to > 360 mg/m 2 of doxorubicin or its equivalent. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity PHESGO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports, use of intravenous trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. In an animal reproduction study, administration of intravenous pertuzumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis resulted in oligohydramnios, delayed fetal kidney development, and embryo-fetal death at exposures 2.5 to 20 times the exposure in humans at the recommended dose, based on C max . Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of PHESGO. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to PHESGO during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of PHESGO [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity PHESGO can cause serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. These adverse reactions have been reported with intravenous trastuzumab. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity. 5.4 Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia PHESGO may exacerbate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. In randomized controlled clinical trials with intravenous trastuzumab, Grade 3-4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not. 5.5 Hypersensitivity and Administration-Related Reactions Severe administration-related reactions (ARRs), including hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and events with fatal outcomes, have been associated with intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab. Patients experiencing dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of a severe or of a fatal ARR. In the FeDeriCa trial, the incidence of hypersensitivity was 1.2% in the PHESGO arm. Administration-related reactions occurred in 21% of patients who received PHESGO. In the PHESGO arm, the most common administration-related reactions were injection site reaction (15%) and injection site pain (2%). Closely monitor patients during and for 30 minutes after the injection of initial dose and during and for 15 minutes following subsequent injections of maintenance dose of PHESGO. If a significant injection-related reaction occurs, slow down or pause the injection and administer appropriate medical therapies. Evaluate and carefully monitor patients until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Permanently discontinue with PHESGO in patients who experience anaphylaxis or severe injection-related reactions. Medications to treat such reactions, as well as emergency equipment, should be available for immediate use. For patients experiencing reversible Grade 1 or 2 hypersensitivity reactions, consider pre-medication with an analgesic, antipyretic, or an antihistamine prior to readministration of PHESGO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . PHESGO is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to pertuzumab, trastuzumab, hyaluronidase or to any of its excipients [see Contraindications (4) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Cardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Pulmonary Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity and Administration-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer The most common adverse reactions (>30%) with PHESGO were alopecia, nausea, diarrhea, anemia, and asthenia. ( 6.1 ) Metastatic Breast Cancer (based on intravenous pertuzumab ) The most common adverse reactions (> 30%) with pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel were diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, rash, and peripheral neuropathy. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer The safety of PHESGO was evaluated in an open-label, multicenter, randomized trial (FeDeriCa) conducted in 500 patients with HER2 overexpressing early breast cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Patients were randomized to receive either PHESGO (1,200 mg pertuzumab, 600 mg trastuzumab, and 30,000 units hyaluronidase/15 mL) followed every 3 weeks by a maintenance dose of 600 mg pertuzumab, 600 mg trastuzumab, and 20,000 units hyaluronidase/10 mL or the recommended dosages for intravenous pertuzumab and intravenous trastuzumab. Patients were randomized to receive 8 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with concurrent administration of 4 cycles of either PHESGO or intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab during cycles 5-8, followed by surgery. Following surgery, patients continued therapy with PHESGO alone or intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab (intravenous or subcutaneously administered) as treated prior to surgery, for an additional 14 cycles, to complete 18 cycles. The median duration of treatment for PHESGO was 24 weeks (range: 0-42 weeks). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients who received PHESGO. Serious adverse reactions in > 1% of patients included febrile neutropenia (4%), neutropenic sepsis (1%), and neutrophil count decreased (1%). One fatal adverse reaction occurred in 1/248 (0.4%) of patients, which was due to acute myocardial infarction, and occurred prior to the start of HER2 targeted treatment with PHESGO. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of any study drug occurred in 8% of patients on the PHESGO arm. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of PHESGO were ejection fraction decreased (1.2%), cardiac failure (0.8%), and pneumonitis/pulmonary fibrosis (0.8%). Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 40% of patients who received PHESGO. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in > 1% of patients who received PHESGO included neutropenia (8%), neutrophil count decreased (4%), and diarrhea (7%).

Table 4 summarizes the laboratory abnormalities in FeDeriCa. Table 4: Select Laboratory Abnormalities (\u22655%) that Worsened from Baseline in Patients Who Received PHESGO in FeDeriCa The denominator used to calculate the rate varied from 163 to 252 based on the number of patients with a baseline value and at least one post-treatment value.

The following adverse reactions have been reported following administration of intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab: diarrhea, alopecia, nausea, fatigue, neutropenia, vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, constipation, anemia, asthenia, mucosal inflammation, myalgia, and thrombocytopenia. Refer to the Prescribing Information for pertuzumab for more information. The safety of intravenous pertuzumab, trastuzumab and docetaxel has been established in patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. The following adverse reactions have been reported following administration of intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab: diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, rash, and peripheral neuropathy. Refer to the Prescribing Information for pertuzumab for more information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified with the use of intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Glomerulopathy Immune thrombocytopenia Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Patients with significant tumor burden (e.g. bulky metastases) may be at a higher risk. Patients could present with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS. Providers should consider additional monitoring and/or treatment as clinically indicated."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Verify the pregnancy status of females prior to initiation of PHESGO. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Pharmacovigilance Program There is a pregnancy pharmacovigilance program for PHESGO. If PHESGO is administered during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving PHESGO or within 7 months following the last dose of PHESGO, health care providers and patients should immediately report PHESGO exposure to Genentech at 1-888-835-2555. Risk Summary PHESGO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports, use of intravenous trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death (see Data ) . In an animal reproduction study, administration of pertuzumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis resulted in oligohydramnios, delayed fetal kidney development, and embryo-fetal deaths at clinically relevant exposures that were 2.5 to 20-fold greater than exposures in humans receiving the recommended dose, based on C max (see Data ) . Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if PHESGO is used during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception (see Clinical Considerations ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received PHESGO during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. Data Human Data In post-marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting in the fetus as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received trastuzumab either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In some case reports, amniotic fluid index increased after trastuzumab was stopped. In one case, trastuzumab therapy resumed after amniotic index improved and oligohydramnios recurred. Animal Data PHESGO for subcutaneous injection contains pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase [see Description (11) ] . Pertuzumab: Pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were treated on Gestational Day (GD) 19 with loading doses of 30 to 150 mg/kg pertuzumab, followed by bi-weekly doses of 10 to 100 mg/kg. These dose levels resulted in clinically relevant exposures of 2.5 to 20-fold greater than exposures in humans receiving the recommended dose, based on C max . Intravenous administration of pertuzumab from GD19 through GD50 (period of organogenesis) was embryotoxic, with dose-dependent increases in embryo-fetal death between GD25 to GD70. The incidences of embryo-fetal loss were 33, 50, and 85%. At Caesarean section on GD100, oligohydramnios, decreased relative lung and kidney weights, and microscopic evidence of renal hypoplasia consistent with delayed renal development were identified in all pertuzumab dose groups. Pertuzumab exposure was reported in offspring from all treated groups, at levels of 29% to 40% of maternal serum levels at GD100. Trastuzumab: In studies where intravenous trastuzumab was administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (up to 25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early (Gestation Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation. The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects. Hyaluronidase: In an embryo-fetal study, mice have been dosed daily by subcutaneous injection during the period of organogenesis with hyaluronidase (recombinant human) at dose levels up to 2,200,000 U/kg, which is >2,400 and 3,600, based on loading and maintenance doses, respectively, times higher than the human dose. The study found no evidence of teratogenicity. Reduced fetal weight and increased numbers of fetal resorptions were observed, with no effects found at a daily dose of 360,000 U/kg, which is >400 and 600, based on loading and maintenance doses, respectively, times higher than the human dose. In a peri-and post-natal reproduction study, mice have been dosed daily by subcutaneous injection, with hyaluronidase (recombinant human) from implantation through lactation and weaning at dose levels up to 1,100,000 U/kg, which is >1,200 and 1,800, based on loading and maintenance doses, respectively, times higher than the human dose. The study found no adverse effects on sexual maturation, learning and memory or fertility of the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of pertuzumab, trastuzumab or hyaluronidase in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Published data suggest that human IgG is present in human milk but does not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts. Trastuzumab was present in the milk of lactating cynomolgus monkeys but not associated with neonatal toxicity (see Data ) . Consider the developmental and health benefits of breast feeding along with the mother's clinical need for PHESGO treatment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from PHESGO or from the underlying maternal condition. This consideration should also take into account the elimination half-life of pertuzumab and the trastuzumab wash out period of 7 months [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Data In lactating cynomolgus monkeys, trastuzumab was present in breast milk at about 0.3% of maternal serum concentrations after pre- (beginning Gestation Day 120) and post-partum (through Post-partum Day 28) doses of 25 mg/kg administered twice weekly (25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg of intravenous trastuzumab). Infant monkeys with detectable serum levels of trastuzumab did not exhibit any adverse effects on growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential PHESGO can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of PHESGO. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of PHESGO [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of PHESGO in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in the FeDeriCa trial (n=500) treated with PHESGO, 11% were 65 and over, while 1.6% were 75 and over. Clinical studies of PHESGO did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In the intravenous trastuzumab trials, the risk of cardiac dysfunction was increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger patients, in both those receiving treatment for adjuvant therapy or metastatic disease. Other differences in safety or effectiveness were not observed between elderly patients and younger patients. In the intravenous pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab trials, the risk of decreased appetite, anemia, weight decreased, asthenia, dysgeusia, neuropathy peripheral and hypomagnesemia was increased in patients 65 years of age and older compared to patients less than 65 years of age."

      "11 DESCRIPTION PHESGO is a combination of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase. Pertuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular dimerization domain (Subdomain II) of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER2). Pertuzumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture. Pertuzumab has an approximate molecular weight of 148 kDa. Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein, HER2. Trastuzumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture. Trastuzumab has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kDa. Hyaluronidase (recombinant human) is an endoglycosidase used to increase the dispersion and absorption of co-administered drugs when administered subcutaneously. It is a glycosylated single-chain protein produced by mammalian (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells containing a DNA plasmid encoding for a soluble fragment of human hyaluronidase (PH20). Hyaluronidase (recombinant human) has a molecular weight of approximately 61 kDa. PHESGO (pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf) injection is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to opalescent, and colorless to slightly brownish solution supplied in single-dose vials for subcutaneous administration. PHESGO injection is supplied as two different configurations: PHESGO is supplied in a 15 mL single-dose vial containing 1,200 mg of pertuzumab, 600 mg of trastuzumab, and 30,000 units of hyaluronidase, and \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose (397 mg), L-histidine (6.75 mg), L-histidine hydrochloric monohydrate (53.7 mg), L-methionine (22.4 mg), polysorbate 20 (6 mg), and sucrose (685 mg) with a pH of 5.5. PHESGO is supplied in a 10 mL single-dose vial containing 600 mg of pertuzumab, 600 mg of trastuzumab, and 20,000 units of hyaluronidase, and \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose (397 mg), L-histidine (4.4 mg), L-histidine hydrochloric monohydrate (36.1 mg), L-methionine (14.9 mg), polysorbate 20 (4 mg), and sucrose (342 mg) with a pH of 5.5."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Pertuzumab targets the extracellular dimerization domain (subdomain II) of HER2 and, thereby, blocks ligand-dependent heterodimerization of HER2 with other HER family members, including EGFR, HER3 and HER4. As a result, pertuzumab inhibits ligand-initiated intracellular signaling through two major signaling pathways, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Inhibition of these signaling pathways can result in cell growth arrest and apoptosis, respectively. Trastuzumab binds to subdomain IV of the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein to inhibit the ligand-independent, HER2 mediated cell proliferation and PI3K signaling pathway in human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Both pertuzumab and trastuzumab-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) have been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. While pertuzumab alone inhibited the proliferation of human tumor cells, the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab augmented anti-tumor activity in HER2-overexpressing xenograft models. Hyaluronan is a polysaccharide found in the extracellular matrix of the subcutaneous tissue. It is depolymerized by the naturally occurring enzyme hyaluronidase. Unlike the stable structural components of the interstitial matrix, hyaluronan has a half-life of approximately 0.5 days. Hyaluronidase increases permeability of the subcutaneous tissue by depolymerizing hyaluronan. In the doses administered, hyaluronidase in PHESGO acts transiently and locally. The effects of hyaluronidase are reversible and permeability of the subcutaneous tissue is restored within 24 to 48 hours. Hyaluronidase has been shown to increase the absorption rate of a trastuzumab product into the systemic circulation when given in the subcutis of G\u00f6ttingen Minipigs. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of pertuzumab and trastuzumab in PHESGO have not been fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous pertuzumab with an initial dose of 840 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 420 mg every three weeks on QTc interval was evaluated in a subgroup of 20 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (NCT00567190). No large changes in the mean QT interval (i.e., greater than 20 ms) from placebo based on Fridericia correction method were detected in the trial. A small increase in the mean QTc interval (i.e., less than 10 ms) cannot be excluded because of the limitations of the trial design. The effects of trastuzumab on electrocardiographic (ECG) endpoints, including QTc interval duration, were evaluated in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. Trastuzumab had no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval duration and there was no apparent relationship between serum trastuzumab concentrations and change in QTcF interval duration in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics (PK) of pertuzumab and trastuzumab were characterized in the FeDeriCa trial following subcutaneous administration of PHESGO (1200 mg pertuzumab/600 mg trastuzumab initial dose followed by 600 mg pertuzumab/600 mg trastuzumab every 3 weeks) and intravenous administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab (840 mg pertuzumab/8 mg/kg trastuzumab initial dose followed by 420 mg pertuzumab/6 mg/kg trastuzumab every 3 weeks). Trastuzumab is estimated to reach concentrations that are <1 mcg/mL by 7 months in at least 95% patients. Pertuzumab Cycle 7 C trough was 88.7 mcg/mL for PHESGO and 72.4 mcg/mL for intravenous pertuzumab with a geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 1.22 (90% CI: 1.14\u20131.31). Trastuzumab Cycle 7 C trough was 57.5 mcg/mL for PHESGO and 43.2 mcg/mL for intravenous trastuzumab with a GMR of 1.33 (90% CI: 1.24\u20131.43) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Following subcutaneous administration of PHESGO , the pertuzumab median Cycle 7 C max was 34% lower and AUC 0-21days was 5% higher than that following intravenous administration of pertuzumab. The median trastuzumab Cycle 7 C max was 31% lower and AUC 0-21days was 10% higher, than that following intravenous administration of trastuzumab. Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability (CV%) was 0.71 (18%) for pertuzumab and 0.77 (13%) for trastuzumab after subcutaneous administration of the approved recommended dosage of PHESGO. The median time to reach Cmax was 3.8 days for both pertuzumab and trastuzumab. Distribution The volume of distribution of pertuzumab and trastuzumab at steady state was 2.8 L and 2.9 L, respectively. Elimination For pertuzumab, the clearance (CV%) was 0.2 L/day (24%). For trastuzumab, the linear clearance was 0.1 L/day (30%); the non-linear elimination Vmax (CV%) was 12 mg/day (20%) and Km (CV%) was 34 mg/L (39%). The terminal half-life of pertuzumab and trastuzumab was 24 days and 22 days, respectively. Steady state concentration was achieved at Cycle 7 for pertuzumab and at Cycle 11 for trastuzumab. Specific Populations No dose adjustments based on body weight or baseline albumin level are needed, as the exposure changes are not considered clinically relevant. In patients with a body weight <58 kg, mean Cycle 7 AUC 0-21 days of trastuzumab was about 33% higher after PHESGO than after intravenous trastuzumab treatment, whereas in the highest BW group (>77 kg) Cycle 7 AUC 0-21 days was 24% lower after PHESGO than after intravenous trastuzumab treatment. However, no body weight-based dose adjustments are needed, as the exposure changes are not considered clinically relevant. No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of pertuzumab and trastuzumab were observed based on age (25 to 80 years), race (Asian and non-Asian), and renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 mL/min or greater determined by Cockcroft-Gault). The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of pertuzumab and trastuzumab are unknown. Drug Interaction Studies There have been no formal clinical drug interaction studies performed with PHESGO. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the trial described below, including those of PHESGO or of other pertuzumab or trastuzumab products. During treatment and post-treatment with subcutaneous administration of PHESGO and concurrent administration with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the FeDeriCa trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] , the incidence of anti-pertuzumab and anti-trastuzumab antibodies was 12.9% (31/241) and 2.1% (5/241), respectively. During treatment and post-treatment with intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab and concurrent administration with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the incidence of anti-pertuzumab and anti-trastuzumab antibodies was 10.6 % (26/245) and 0.4% (1/245), respectively. The incidence of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to pertuzumab and to trastuzumab was 6% (2/31) and 20% (1/5), respectively, in patients treated with PHESGO. The corresponding incidences of NAb were 11.5% (3/26) and 0% (0/1), respectively, in patients treated with intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab. Because of limited immunogenicity data, the effect of anti-pertuzumab and anti-trastuzumab antibodies on the pharmacokinetics and effectiveness of PHESGO is unknown. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-pertuzumab and anti-trastuzumab antibodies on the safety of PHESGO. In the FeDeriCa trial, the incidence of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies was 6.3% (15/238) and the incidence of NAb was 0% (0/15) in patients treated with PHESGO. Because of limited immunogenicity data, the clinical impact of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies is unknown."

Both pertuzumab and trastuzumab-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) have been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. While pertuzumab alone inhibited the proliferation of human tumor cells, the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab augmented anti-tumor activity in HER2-overexpressing xenograft models. Hyaluronan is a polysaccharide found in the extracellular matrix of the subcutaneous tissue. It is depolymerized by the naturally occurring enzyme hyaluronidase. Unlike the stable structural components of the interstitial matrix, hyaluronan has a half-life of approximately 0.5 days. Hyaluronidase increases permeability of the subcutaneous tissue by depolymerizing hyaluronan. In the doses administered, hyaluronidase in PHESGO acts transiently and locally. The effects of hyaluronidase are reversible and permeability of the subcutaneous tissue is restored within 24 to 48 hours. Hyaluronidase has been shown to increase the absorption rate of a trastuzumab product into the systemic circulation when given in the subcutis of G\u00f6ttingen Minipigs."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of pertuzumab and trastuzumab in PHESGO have not been fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous pertuzumab with an initial dose of 840 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 420 mg every three weeks on QTc interval was evaluated in a subgroup of 20 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (NCT00567190). No large changes in the mean QT interval (i.e., greater than 20 ms) from placebo based on Fridericia correction method were detected in the trial. A small increase in the mean QTc interval (i.e., less than 10 ms) cannot be excluded because of the limitations of the trial design. The effects of trastuzumab on electrocardiographic (ECG) endpoints, including QTc interval duration, were evaluated in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. Trastuzumab had no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval duration and there was no apparent relationship between serum trastuzumab concentrations and change in QTcF interval duration in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics (PK) of pertuzumab and trastuzumab were characterized in the FeDeriCa trial following subcutaneous administration of PHESGO (1200 mg pertuzumab/600 mg trastuzumab initial dose followed by 600 mg pertuzumab/600 mg trastuzumab every 3 weeks) and intravenous administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab (840 mg pertuzumab/8 mg/kg trastuzumab initial dose followed by 420 mg pertuzumab/6 mg/kg trastuzumab every 3 weeks). Trastuzumab is estimated to reach concentrations that are <1 mcg/mL by 7 months in at least 95% patients. Pertuzumab Cycle 7 C trough was 88.7 mcg/mL for PHESGO and 72.4 mcg/mL for intravenous pertuzumab with a geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 1.22 (90% CI: 1.14\u20131.31). Trastuzumab Cycle 7 C trough was 57.5 mcg/mL for PHESGO and 43.2 mcg/mL for intravenous trastuzumab with a GMR of 1.33 (90% CI: 1.24\u20131.43) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Following subcutaneous administration of PHESGO , the pertuzumab median Cycle 7 C max was 34% lower and AUC 0-21days was 5% higher than that following intravenous administration of pertuzumab. The median trastuzumab Cycle 7 C max was 31% lower and AUC 0-21days was 10% higher, than that following intravenous administration of trastuzumab. Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability (CV%) was 0.71 (18%) for pertuzumab and 0.77 (13%) for trastuzumab after subcutaneous administration of the approved recommended dosage of PHESGO. The median time to reach Cmax was 3.8 days for both pertuzumab and trastuzumab. Distribution The volume of distribution of pertuzumab and trastuzumab at steady state was 2.8 L and 2.9 L, respectively. Elimination For pertuzumab, the clearance (CV%) was 0.2 L/day (24%). For trastuzumab, the linear clearance was 0.1 L/day (30%); the non-linear elimination Vmax (CV%) was 12 mg/day (20%) and Km (CV%) was 34 mg/L (39%). The terminal half-life of pertuzumab and trastuzumab was 24 days and 22 days, respectively. Steady state concentration was achieved at Cycle 7 for pertuzumab and at Cycle 11 for trastuzumab. Specific Populations No dose adjustments based on body weight or baseline albumin level are needed, as the exposure changes are not considered clinically relevant. In patients with a body weight <58 kg, mean Cycle 7 AUC 0-21 days of trastuzumab was about 33% higher after PHESGO than after intravenous trastuzumab treatment, whereas in the highest BW group (>77 kg) Cycle 7 AUC 0-21 days was 24% lower after PHESGO than after intravenous trastuzumab treatment. However, no body weight-based dose adjustments are needed, as the exposure changes are not considered clinically relevant. No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of pertuzumab and trastuzumab were observed based on age (25 to 80 years), race (Asian and non-Asian), and renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 mL/min or greater determined by Cockcroft-Gault). The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of pertuzumab and trastuzumab are unknown. Drug Interaction Studies There have been no formal clinical drug interaction studies performed with PHESGO."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer The effectiveness of PHESGO for use in combination with chemotherapy has been established for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Use of PHESGO for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies conducted with intravenous pertuzumab and intravenous trastuzumab administered in combination with chemotherapy in adults with HER2-overexpressing early breast cancer (NCT00545688, NCT00976989, NCT02132949, NCT01358877) and additional pharmacokinetic and safety data that demonstrated comparable pharmacokinetics and safety profiles between PHESGO and intravenous pertuzumab and intravenous trastuzumab in FeDeriCa [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. FeDeriCa The FeDeriCa trial (NCT03493854) was an open-label, multicenter, randomized trial conducted in 500 patients with operable or locally advanced (including inflammatory) HER2-positive breast cancer with a tumor size >2 cm or node-positive. HER2 overexpression was defined as IHC 3+ in >10% of immunoreactive cells or HER2 gene amplification by ISH (ratio of HER2 gene signals to centromere 17 signals \u22652.0) using an FDA-approved test. Patients were randomized to receive 8 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with concurrent administration of 4 cycles of either PHESGO or intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab during cycles 5-8, followed by surgery. Investigators selected one of two of the following neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens for individual patients: 4 cycles of doxorubicin (60 mg/m 2 ) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m 2 ) every 2 weeks followed by paclitaxel (80 mg/m 2 ) weekly for 12 weeks 4 cycles of doxorubicin (60 mg/m 2 ) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m 2 ) every 3 weeks followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel (75 mg/m 2 for the first cycle and then 100 mg/m 2 at subsequent cycles at the investigator's discretion) every 3 weeks Following surgery, patients continued therapy with PHESGO or intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab as treated prior to surgery, for an additional 14 cycles, to complete 18 cycles of anti-HER2 therapy. Patients also received adjuvant radiotherapy and endocrine therapy as per investigator's discretion. In adjuvant period, substitution of intravenous trastuzumab for subcutaneous trastuzumab was permitted at investigator discretion. Patients received HER2-targeted therapy every 3 weeks according to Table 5 as follows: Table 5: Dosing and Administration of PHESGO, Intravenous Pertuzumab, Intravenous Trastuzumab, and Subcutaneous Trastuzumab Medication Administration Dose Initial Maintenance PHESGO Subcutaneously 1200 mg/600 mg 600mg/600 mg Pertuzumab Intravenously 840 mg 420 mg Trastuzumab Intravenously 8 mg/kg 6 mg/kg Trastuzumab-oysk Subcutaneously In adjuvant period substitution of intravenous trastuzumab for subcutaneous trastuzumab was permitted at investigator discretion 600 mg FeDeriCa was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Cycle 7 (i.e., pre-dose Cycle 8) pertuzumab serum C trough from PHESGO pertuzumab to the intravenous pertuzumab (major efficacy outcome measure) [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.3 ] . Additional outcome measures included Cycle 7 serum trastuzumab C trough , efficacy (pathological complete response [pCR], defined as the absence of invasive neoplastic cells in the breast and in the axillary lymph nodes), and safety. The median age of patients was 51 years (range: 25-81); 99% were female; 66% were White, 21% were Asian, 4% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 1.2% were Black or African American, 15% were Hispanic or Latino. The majority of patients had hormone receptor-positive disease (61%) or node-positive disease (58%).

Use of PHESGO for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies conducted with intravenous pertuzumab and intravenous trastuzumab administered in combination with chemotherapy in adults with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (NCT00567190) and additional pharmacokinetic and safety data that demonstrated comparable pharmacokinetics and safety profiles between PHESGO and intravenous pertuzumab and intravenous trastuzumab in FeDeriCa [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 14.3 Patient Experience The PHranceSCa trial (NCT03674112) was a randomized, multi-center, open-label cross-over trial conducted in 160 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer undergoing adjuvant treatment. All patients completed neoadjuvant treatment with pertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy and had surgery before randomization. Following randomization, 80 patients in arm A received 3 cycles of intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab followed by 3 cycles of PHESGO and 80 patients in arm B received 3 cycles of PHESGO followed by 3 cycles of intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab. All patients received 18 total cycles of HER2-targeted therapy. After Cycle 6, 136 out of 160 patients (85%) reported preferring subcutaneous administration of PHESGO over intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab and the most common reason was that administration required less time in the clinic. After Cycle 6, 22 out of 160 patients (14%) reported preferring intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab over PHESGO and the most common reason was feels more comfortable during administration. Two out of 160 patients (1%) had no preference for the route of administration. All 160 patients (100%) completed the preference questionnaire."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous (IV) infusion only. Do not administer as an IV push or bolus. Herceptin has different dosage and administration instructions than subcutaneous trastuzumab products. ( 2.3 ) Do not substitute Herceptin (trastuzumab) for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. ( 2.3 ) Perform HER2 testing using FDA-approved tests by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. ( 1 , 2.2 ) Adjuvant Treatment of HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer ( 2.2 ) Administer at either: Initial dose of 4 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion, then 2 mg/kg over 30 minutes IV infusion weekly for 12 weeks (with paclitaxel or docetaxel) or 18 weeks (with docetaxel and carboplatin). One week after the last weekly dose of Herceptin, administer 6 mg/kg as an IV infusion over 30\u201390 minutes every three weeks to complete a total of 52 weeks of therapy, or Initial dose of 8 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion, then 6 mg/kg over 30\u201390 minutes IV infusion every three weeks for 52 weeks. Metastatic HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer ( 2.3 ) Initial dose of 4 mg/kg as a 90 minutes IV infusion followed by subsequent weekly doses of 2 mg/kg as 30 minutes IV infusions. Metastatic HER2-Overexpressing Gastric Cancer ( 2.3 ) Initial dose of 8 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion, followed by 6 mg/kg over 30 to 90 minutes IV infusion every 3 weeks. 2.1 Evaluation and Testing Before Initiating Herceptin Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of Herceptin and at regular intervals during treatment. [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Herceptin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] . 2.2 Patient Selection Select patients based on HER2 protein overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in tumor specimens [see Indications and Usage (1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . Assessment of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification should be performed using FDA-approved tests specific for breast or gastric cancers by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. Information on the FDA-approved tests for the detection of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. Assessment of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification in metastatic gastric cancer should be performed using FDA-approved tests specifically for gastric cancers due to differences in gastric vs. breast histopathology, including incomplete membrane staining and more frequent heterogeneous expression of HER2 seen in gastric cancers. Improper assay performance, including use of suboptimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents, deviation from specific assay instructions, and failure to include appropriate controls for assay validation, can lead to unreliable results. 2.3 Recommended Dosage Herceptin is for intravenous infusion only. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. Herceptin has different dosage and administration instructions than subcutaneous trastuzumab products. Do not mix Herceptin with other drugs. Do not substitute Herceptin (trastuzumab) for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer Administer according to one of the following doses and schedules for a total of 52 weeks of Herceptin therapy: During and following paclitaxel, docetaxel, or docetaxel/carboplatin: Initial dose of 4 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes then at 2 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes weekly during chemotherapy for the first 12 weeks (paclitaxel or docetaxel) or 18 weeks (docetaxel and carboplatin). One week following the last weekly dose of Herceptin, administer Herceptin at 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30\u201390 minutes every three weeks. As a single agent within three weeks following completion of multi-modality, anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens: Initial dose at 8 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes Subsequent doses at 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30\u201390 minutes every three weeks. Extending adjuvant treatment beyond one year is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Metastatic Breast Cancer Administer Herceptin, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, at an initial dose of 4 mg/kg as a 90-minute intravenous infusion followed by subsequent once weekly doses of 2 mg/kg as 30-minute intravenous infusions until disease progression. Metastatic Gastric Cancer Administer Herceptin at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg as a 90-minute intravenous infusion followed by subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30\u201390 minutes every three weeks until disease progression . 2.4 Important Dosing Considerations Missed Dose If the patient has missed a dose of Herceptin by one week or less, then the usual maintenance dose (weekly schedule: 2 mg/kg; once every three weeks schedule: 6 mg/kg) should be administered as soon as possible. Do not wait until the next planned cycle. Subsequent Herceptin maintenance doses should be administered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or once every three week schedules, respectively. If the patient has missed a dose of Herceptin by more than one week, a re-loading dose of Herceptin should be administered over approximately 90 minutes (weekly schedule: 4 mg/kg; once every three week schedule: 8 mg/kg) as soon as possible. Subsequent Herceptin maintenance doses (weekly schedule: 2 mg/kg; three-weekly schedule 6 mg/kg) should be administered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or once every three week schedules, respectively. 2.5 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Infusion Reactions [See Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Decrease the rate of infusion for mild or moderate infusion reactions Interrupt the infusion in patients with dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension Discontinue Herceptin for severe or life-threatening infusion reactions. Cardiomyopathy [See Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of Herceptin and at regular intervals during treatment. Withhold Herceptin dosing for at least 4 weeks for either of the following: \u2265 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values LVEF below institutional limits of normal and \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. Herceptin may be resumed if, within 4\u20138 weeks, the LVEF returns to normal limits and the absolute decrease from baseline is \u2264 15%. Permanently discontinue Herceptin for a persistent (> 8 weeks) LVEF decline or for suspension of Herceptin dosing on more than 3 occasions for cardiomyopathy. 2.6 Preparation Instructions To prevent medication errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the drug being prepared and administered is Herceptin (trastuzumab) and not ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. 150 mg Single-dose vial Reconstitution Reconstitute each 150 mg vial of Herceptin with 7.4 mL of Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) (not supplied) to yield a single-dose solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab that delivers 7.15 mL (150 mg trastuzumab). Use appropriate aseptic technique when performing the following reconstitution steps: Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 7.4 mL of SWFI (not supplied) into the vial containing the lyophilized powder of Herceptin, which has a cake-like appearance. The stream of diluent should be directed into the cake. The reconstituted vial yields a solution for single-dose use, containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab. Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE . Slight foaming of the product may be present upon reconstitution. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect visually for particulates and discoloration. The solution should be free of visible particulates, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. Use the Herceptin solution immediately following reconstitution with SWFI, as it contains no preservative and is intended for single-dose only. If not used immediately, store the reconstituted Herceptin solution for up to 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) ; discard any unused Herceptin after 24 hours. Do not freeze . Dilution Determine the dose (mg) of Herceptin [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Calculate the volume of the 21 mg/mL reconstituted Herceptin solution needed. Withdraw this amount from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. DO NOT USE DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. The solution of Herceptin for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, should be stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for no more than 24 hours prior to use. Discard after 24 hours. This storage time is additional to the time allowed for the reconstituted vials. Do not freeze ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) 5.1 Cardiomyopathy Herceptin can cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death [see Boxed Warning: Cardiomyopathy ] . Herceptin can also cause asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). There is a 4\u20136 fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction among patients receiving Herceptin as a single agent or in combination therapy compared with those not receiving Herceptin. The highest absolute incidence occurs when Herceptin is administered with an anthracycline. Withhold Herceptin for \u2265 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values or an LVEF value below institutional limits of normal and \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The safety of continuation or resumption of Herceptin in patients with Herceptin-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied. Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping Herceptin may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Cardiac Monitoring Conduct thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan. The following schedule is recommended: Baseline LVEF measurement immediately prior to initiation of Herceptin LVEF measurements every 3 months during and upon completion of Herceptin Repeat LVEF measurement at 4 week intervals if Herceptin is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] LVEF measurements every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of Herceptin as a component of adjuvant therapy. In NSABP B31, 15% (158/1031) of patients discontinued Herceptin due to clinical evidence of myocardial dysfunction or significant decline in LVEF after a median follow-up duration of 8.7 years in the AC-TH arm. In HERA (one-year Herceptin treatment), the number of patients who discontinued Herceptin due to cardiac toxicity at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up was 2.6% (44/1678). In BCIRG006, a total of 2.9% (31/1056) of patients in the TCH arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 1.4% during the monotherapy phase) and 5.7% (61/1068) of patients in the AC-TH arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 4.2% during the monotherapy phase) discontinued Herceptin due to cardiac toxicity. Among 64 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831) who developed congestive heart failure, one patient died of cardiomyopathy, one patient died suddenly without documented etiology, and 33 patients were receiving cardiac medication at last follow-up. Approximately 24% of the surviving patients had recovery to a normal LVEF (defined as \u2265 50%) and no symptoms on continuing medical management at the time of last follow-up. Incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) is presented in Table 1 . The safety of continuation or resumption of Herceptin in patients with Herceptin-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied. Table 1: Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure in Adjuvant Breast Cancer Studies Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure % (n) Study Regimen Herceptin Control NSABP B31 & NCCTG N9831 Median follow-up duration for NSABP B31 & NCCTG N9831 combined was 8.3 years in the AC\u2192paclitaxel+Herceptin arm. AC Anthracycline (doxorubicin) and cyclophosphamide. \u2192Paclitaxel+Herceptin 3.2% (64/2000) Includes 1 patient with fatal cardiomyopathy and 1 patient with sudden death without documented etiology. 1.3% (21/1655) HERA Includes NYHA II-IV and cardiac death at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up in the one-year Herceptin arm.

In post-marketing reports, serious and fatal infusion reactions have been reported. Severe reactions, which include bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypoxia, and severe hypotension, were usually reported during or immediately following the initial infusion. However, the onset and clinical course were variable, including progressive worsening, initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration, or delayed post-infusion events with rapid clinical deterioration. For fatal events, death occurred within hours to days following a serious infusion reaction. Interrupt Herceptin infusion in all patients experiencing dyspnea, clinically significant hypotension, and intervention of medical therapy administered (which may include epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, bronchodilators, and oxygen). Patients should be evaluated and carefully monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Permanent discontinuation should be strongly considered in all patients with severe infusion reactions. There are no data regarding the most appropriate method of identification of patients who may safely be retreated with Herceptin after experiencing a severe infusion reaction. Prior to resumption of Herceptin infusion, the majority of patients who experienced a severe infusion reaction were pre-medicated with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. While some patients tolerated Herceptin infusions, others had recurrent severe infusion reactions despite pre-medications. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Herceptin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports, use of Herceptin during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Herceptin. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to Herceptin during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of Herceptin [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Herceptin use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity. 5.5 Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3\u20134 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving Herceptin in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received Herceptin and those who did not [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

( 6.1 ) Metastatic Breast Cancer Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) are fever, chills, headache, infection, congestive heart failure, insomnia, cough, and rash. ( 6.1 ) Metastatic Gastric Cancer Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) are neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving Herceptin in the adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer setting are fever, nausea, vomiting, infusion reactions, diarrhea, infections, increased cough, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, neutropenia, anemia, and myalgia. Adverse reactions requiring interruption or discontinuation of Herceptin treatment include CHF, significant decline in left ventricular cardiac function, severe infusion reactions, and pulmonary toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . In the metastatic gastric cancer setting, the most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) that were increased (\u2265 5% difference) in the Herceptin arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. The most common adverse reactions which resulted in discontinuation of treatment on the Herceptin-containing arm in the absence of disease progression were infection, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia. Adjuvant Breast Cancer The information below reflects exposure to one-year Herceptin therapy across three randomized, open-label studies, Studies 1, 2, and 3, with (n = 3678) or without (n = 3363) trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.

In HERA, a comparison of Herceptin administered once every 3 weeks for two years versus one year was performed. The rate of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was increased in the 2-year Herceptin compared to the 1-year Herceptin treatment arm (8.1% versus 4.6%, respectively). More patients experienced at least one adverse reaction of Grade 3 or higher in the 2-year Herceptin treatment arm (20.4%) compared with the one-year Herceptin treatment arm (16.3%). NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 The safety data from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 were obtained from 3655 patients, of whom 2000 received Herceptin; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In NSABP B31, only Grade 3\u20135 adverse events, treatment-related Grade 2 events, and Grade 2\u20135 dyspnea were collected during and for up to 3 months following protocol-specified treatment. The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2\u20135 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving Herceptin plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: fatigue (29.5% vs. 22.4%), infection (24.0% vs. 12.8%), hot flashes (17.1% vs. 15%), anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7%), dyspnea (11.8% vs. 4.6%), rash/desquamation (10.9% vs. 7.6%), leukopenia (10.5% vs. 8.4%), neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3%), headache (6.2% vs. 3.8%), pain (5.5% vs. 3%), edema (4.7% vs. 2.7%), and insomnia (4.3% vs. 1.5%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. In NCCTG N9831, data collection was limited to the following investigator-attributed treatment-related adverse reactions: NCI-CTC Grade 4 and 5 hematologic toxicities, Grade 3\u20135 non-hematologic toxicities, selected Grade 2\u20135 toxicities associated with taxanes (myalgia, arthralgias, nail changes, motor neuropathy, and sensory neuropathy) and Grade 1\u20135 cardiac toxicities occurring during chemotherapy and/or Herceptin treatment. The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2\u20135 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving Herceptin plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: arthralgia (12.2% vs. 9.1%), nail changes (11.5% vs. 6.8%), dyspnea (2.4% vs. 0.2%), and diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. BCIRG006 Safety data from BCIRG006 reflect exposure to Herceptin as part of an adjuvant treatment regimen from 2124 patients receiving at least one dose of study treatment [AC-TH: n = 1068; TCH: n = 1056]. The overall median treatment duration was 54 weeks in both the AC-TH and TCH arms. The median number of infusions was 26 in the AC-TH arm and 30 in the TCH arm, including weekly infusions during the chemotherapy phase and once every three week dosing in the monotherapy period [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In BCIRG006, the toxicity profile was similar to that reported in Studies NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, and HERA with the exception of a lower incidence of CHF in the TCH arm. Metastatic Breast Cancer Studies The safety of Herceptin was evaluated in one randomized, open-label study (H0648g) of chemotherapy with (n = 235) or without (n = 234) intravenous trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast cancerand in one single-arm study (H0649g); in patients with metastatic breast cancer (n=222) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Patients received 4 mg/kg initial dose of Herceptin followed by 2 mg/kg weekly. In H0648g, 58% of patients received Herceptin for \u2265 6 months and 9% received Herceptin \u2265 12 months, respectively. In H0649g, 31% of patients received Herceptin for \u2265 6 months and 16% received Herceptin for \u2265 12 months, respectively. Table 4 shows the adverse reactions ( \u2265 5%) in patients from H0648g and H0649g. Table 4: Adverse Reactions \u2265 (5%) in the Herceptin Arms in H0648g and H0649g Herceptin Data for Herceptin single agent were from 4 studies, including 213 patients from H0649g. n = 352 % Herceptin + Paclitaxel n = 91 % Paclitaxel n = 95 % Herceptin + AC Anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) and cyclophosphamide. n = 143 % AC n = 135 % General Pain 47 61 62 57 42 Asthenia 42 62 57 54 55 Fever 36 49 23 56 34 Chills 32 41 4 35 11 Headache 26 36 28 44 31 Abdominal pain 22 34 22 23 18 Back pain 22 34 30 27 15 Infection 20 47 27 47 31 Flu syndrome 10 12 5 12 6 Accidental injury 6 13 3 9 4 Allergic reaction 3 8 2 4 2 Gastrointestinal Nausea 33 51 9 76 77 Diarrhea 25 45 29 45 26 Vomiting 23 37 28 53 49 Anorexia 14 24 16 31 26 Nausea and vomiting 8 14 11 18 9 Respiratory Cough increased 26 41 22 43 29 Dyspnea 22 27 26 42 25 Rhinitis 14 22 5 22 16 Pharyngitis 12 22 14 30 18 Sinusitis 9 21 7 13 6 Skin Rash 18 38 18 27 17 Herpes simplex 2 12 3 7 9 Acne 2 11 3 3 < 1 Nervous Insomnia 14 25 13 29 15 Dizziness 13 22 24 24 18 Paresthesia 9 48 39 17 11 Depression 6 12 13 20 12 Peripheral neuritis 2 23 16 2 2 Neuropathy 1 13 5 4 4 Metabolic Peripheral edema 10 22 20 20 17 Edema 8 10 8 11 5 Cardiovascular Congestive heart failure 7 11 1 28 7 Tachycardia 5 12 4 10 5 Musculoskeletal Bone pain 7 24 18 7 7 Arthralgia 6 37 21 8 9 Urogenital Urinary tract infection 5 18 14 13 7 Blood and Lymphatic Anemia 4 14 9 36 26 Leukopenia 3 24 17 52 34 Metastatic Gastric Cancer The safety of Herceptin was evaluated in patients with previously untreated for metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in an open label, multi-center trial (ToGA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive Herceptin in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (FC+H) (n=294) or chemotherapy alone (FC) (n=290) Patients in the Herceptin plus chemotherapy arm received Herceptin 8 mg/kg administered on Day 1 (prior to chemotherapy) followed by 6 mg/kg every 21 days until disease progression. Cisplatin was administered at 80 mg/m 2 on Day 1 and the fluoropyrimidine was administered as either capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 orally twice a day on Days 1\u201314 or 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m 2 /day as a continuous intravenous infusion Days 1 through 5. Chemotherapy was administered for six 21-day cycles. Median duration of Herceptin treatment was 21 weeks and the median number of Herceptin infusions administered was eight.

Cardiomyopathy Serial measurement of cardiac function (LVEF) was obtained in clinical trials in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. In HERA, the median duration of follow-up was 12.6 months (12.4 months in the observation arm; 12.6 months in the 1-year Herceptin arm); and in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, 7.9 years in the AC-T arm, 8.3 years in the AC-TH arm. Following initiation of Herceptin therapy, the incidence of new-onset dose-limiting myocardial dysfunction was higher among patients receiving Herceptin and paclitaxel as compared to those receiving paclitaxel alone in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and in patients receiving one-year Herceptin monotherapy compared to observation in HERA (see Table 6 , Figures 1 and 2 ). The incidence of new-onset cardiac dysfunction, as measured by LVEF, remained similar when compared to the analysis performed at a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC-TH arm. This analysis showed evidence of reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction, with 64.5% of patients who experienced symptomatic CHF in the AC-TH group being asymptomatic at latest follow-up, and 90.3% having full or partial LVEF recovery. Table 6: Myocardial Dysfunction (by LVEF) in Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4 For Studies 1, 2 and 3, events are counted from the beginning of Herceptin treatment. For BCIRG006, events are counted from the date of randomization.

Figure 3 BCIRG006: Cumulative Incidence of Time to First LVEF Decline of \u2265 10 Percentage Points from Baseline and to Below 50% with Death as a Competing Risk Event Time 0 is the date of randomization. The incidence of congestive heart failure among patients in the metastatic breast cancer trials was classified for severity using the New York Heart Association classification system (I\u2013IV, where IV is the most severe level of cardiac failure) (see Table 2 ). In the metastatic breast cancer trials, the probability of cardiac dysfunction was highest in patients who received Herceptin concurrently with anthracyclines. In ToGA, 5% of patients in the Herceptin plus chemotherapy arm compared to 1.1% of patients in the chemotherapy alone arm had LVEF value below 50% with a \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Infusion Reactions During the first infusion with Herceptin, the symptoms most commonly reported were chills and fever, occurring in approximately 40% of patients in clinical trials. Symptoms were treated with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and meperidine (with or without reduction in the rate of Herceptin infusion); permanent discontinuation of Herceptin for infusion reactions was required in < 1% of patients. Other signs and/or symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), rigors, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, elevated blood pressure, rash, and asthenia. Infusion reactions occurred in 21% and 35% of patients, and were severe in 1.4% and 9% of patients, on second or subsequent Herceptin infusions administered as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, respectively. In the post-marketing setting, severe infusion reactions, including hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and angioedema have been reported. Anemia In randomized controlled clinical trials, the overall incidence of anemia (30% vs. 21% [H0648g]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2\u20135 anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7% [NSABP B31]), and of anemia requiring transfusions (0.1% vs. 0 patients [NCCTG N9831]) were increased in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Following the administration of Herceptin as a single agent (H0649g), the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 anemia was < 1%. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer), on the Herceptin containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the overall incidence of anemia was 28% compared to 21% and of NCI- CTC Grade 3/4 anemia was 12.2% compared to 10.3%. Neutropenia In randomized controlled clinical trials in the adjuvant setting, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 4\u20135 neutropenia (1.7% vs. 0.8% [NCCTG N9831]) and of selected Grade 2\u20135 neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3% [NSABP B31]) were increased in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. In a randomized, controlled trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia (32% vs. 22%) and of febrile neutropenia (23% vs. 17%) were also increased in patients randomized to Herceptin in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer) on the Herceptin containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 36.8% compared to 28.9%; febrile neutropenia 5.1% compared to 2.8%. Infection The overall incidences of infection (46% vs. 30% [H0648g]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2\u20135 infection/febrile neutropenia (24.3% vs. 13.4% [NSABP B31]) and of selected Grade 3\u20135 infection/febrile neutropenia (2.9% vs. 1.4% [NCCTG N9831]) were higher in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. The most common site of infections in the adjuvant setting involved the upper respiratory tract, skin, and urinary tract. In BCIRG006, the overall incidence of infection was higher with the addition of Herceptin to AC-T but not to TCH [44% (AC-TH), 37% (TCH), 38% (AC-T)]. The incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3\u20134 infection were similar [25% (AC-TH), 21% (TCH), 23% (AC-T)] across the three arms. In a randomized, controlled trial in treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the reported incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher (23% vs. 17%) in patients receiving Herceptin in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. Pulmonary Toxicity Adjuvant Breast Cancer Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2\u20135 pulmonary toxicity (14.3% vs. 5.4% [NSABP B31]) and of selected NCI-CTC Grade 3\u20135 pulmonary toxicity and spontaneous reported Grade 2 dyspnea (3.4% vs. 0.9% [NCCTG N9831]) was higher in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. The most common pulmonary toxicity was dyspnea (NCI-CTC Grade 2\u20135: 11.8% vs. 4.6% [NSABP B31]; NCI-CTC Grade 2\u20135: 2.4% vs. 0.2% [NCCTG N9831]). Pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving Herceptin compared with 0.3% of those receiving chemotherapy alone. Fatal respiratory failure occurred in 3 patients receiving Herceptin, one as a component of multi-organ system failure, as compared to 1 patient receiving chemotherapy alone. In HERA, there were 4 cases of interstitial pneumonitis in the one-year Herceptin treatment arm compared to none in the observation arm at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months. Metastatic Breast Cancer Among women receiving Herceptin for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the incidence of pulmonary toxicity was also increased. Pulmonary adverse events have been reported in the post-marketing experience as part of the symptom complex of infusion reactions. Pulmonary events include bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. For a detailed description, see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) . Thrombosis/Embolism In 4 randomized, controlled clinical trials, the incidence of thrombotic adverse events was higher in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in three studies (2.6% vs. 1.5% [NSABP B31], 2.5% and 3.7% vs. 2.2% [BCIRG006] and 2.1% vs. 0% [H0648g]). Diarrhea Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 2\u20135 diarrhea (6.7% vs. 5.4% [NSABP B31]) and of NCI-CTC Grade 3\u20135 diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0% [NCCTG N9831]), and of Grade 1\u20134 diarrhea (7% vs. 1% [HERA; one-year Herceptin treatment at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up]) were higher in patients receiving Herceptin as compared to controls. In BCIRG006, the incidence of Grade 3\u20134 diarrhea was higher [5.7% AC-TH, 5.5% TCH vs. 3.0% AC-T] and of Grade 1\u20134 was higher [51% AC-TH, 63% TCH vs. 43% AC-T] among women receiving Herceptin. Of patients receiving Herceptin as a single agent for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, 25% experienced diarrhea. An increased incidence of diarrhea was observed in patients receiving Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Renal Toxicity In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer) on the Herceptin-containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm the incidence of renal impairment was 18% compared to 14.5%. Severe (Grade 3/4) renal failure was 2.7% on the Herceptin-containing arm compared to 1.7% on the chemotherapy only arm. Treatment discontinuation for renal insufficiency/failure was 2% on the Herceptin-containing arm and 0.3% on the chemotherapy only arm. In the post-marketing setting, rare cases of nephrotic syndrome with pathologic evidence of glomerulopathy have been reported. The time to onset ranged from 4 months to approximately 18 months from initiation of Herceptin therapy. Pathologic findings included membranous glomerulonephritis, focal glomerulosclerosis, and fibrillary glomerulonephritis. Complications included volume overload and congestive heart failure. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Herceptin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infusion reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Oligohydramnios or oligohydramnios sequence, including pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Glomerulopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Immune thrombocytopenia Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Cases of possible TLS have been reported in patients treated with Herceptin. Patients with significant tumor burden (e.g. bulky metastases) may be at a higher risk. Patients could present with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS. Providers should consider additional monitoring and/or treatment as clinically indicated."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Verify the pregnancy status of females prior to initiation of Herceptin ( 8.3 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Pharmacovigilance Program There is a pregnancy pharmacovigilance program for Herceptin. If Herceptin is administered during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving Herceptin or within 7 months following the last dose of Herceptin, health care providers and patients should immediately report Herceptin exposure to Genentech at 1-888-835-2555. Risk Summary Herceptin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of Herceptin during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Data ]. Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if Herceptin is used in a pregnant woman or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of Herceptin [see Clinical Considerations ]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received Herceptin during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal/neonatal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. Data Human Data In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of Herceptin during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence. Fetal manifestations included pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received Herceptin either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In most reported cases, amniotic fluid index increased after Herceptin was stopped. In reported cases where Herceptin therapy was resumed after amniotic index improved, oligohydramnios recurred. Animal Data In studies where trastuzumab was administered to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (up to 25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early (Gestation Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation. The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of trastuzumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Published data suggest human IgG is present in human milk but does not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts. Trastuzumab was present in the milk of lactating Cynomolgus monkeys but not associated with neonatal toxicity [see Data ]. Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's clinical need for Herceptin treatment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Herceptin or from the underlying maternal condition. This consideration should also take into account the trastuzumab wash out period of 7 months [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Data In lactating Cynomolgus monkeys, trastuzumab was present in breast milk at about 0.3% of maternal serum concentrations after pre- (beginning Gestation Day 120) and post-partum (through Post-partum Day 28) doses of 25 mg/kg administered twice weekly (25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg of Herceptin). Infant monkeys with detectable serum levels of trastuzumab did not exhibit any adverse effects on growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Herceptin. Contraception Females Herceptin can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Herceptin and for 7 months following the last dose of Herceptin [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Herceptin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Herceptin has been administered to 386 patients who were 65 years of age or over (253 in the adjuvant treatment and 133 in metastatic breast cancer treatment settings). The risk of cardiac dysfunction was increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger patients in both those receiving treatment for metastatic disease in H0648g and H0649g, or adjuvant therapy in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831. Limitations in data collection and differences in study design of the 4 studies of Herceptin in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer preclude a determination of whether the toxicity profile of Herceptin in older patients is different from younger patients. The reported clinical experience is not adequate to determine whether the efficacy improvements (ORR, TTP, OS, DFS) of Herceptin treatment in older patients is different from that observed in patients < 65 years of age for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer), of the 294 patients treated with Herceptin, 108 (37%) were 65 years of age or older, while 13 (4.4%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein, HER2. Trastuzumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture. Herceptin (trastuzumab) for injection is a sterile, white to pale yellow, preservative-free lyophilized powder with a cake-like appearance, for intravenous administration. Each single-dose vial of Herceptin delivers 150 mg trastuzumab, 136.2 mg \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose dihydrate, 3.4 mg L-histidine HCl monohydrate, 2.2 mg L-histidine, and 0.6 mg polysorbate 20. Reconstitution with 7.4 mL of sterile water for injection (SWFI) yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab that delivers 7.15 mL (150 mg trastuzumab), at a pH of approximately 6."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Herceptin has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Herceptin is a mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro , Herceptin-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Herceptin exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic responses are not fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effects of trastuzumab on electrocardiographic (ECG) endpoints, including QTc interval duration, were evaluated in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. Trastuzumab had no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval duration and there was no apparent relationship between serum trastuzumab concentrations and change in QTcF interval duration in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was evaluated in a pooled population pharmacokinetic (PK) model analysis of 1,582 subjects with primarily breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) receiving intravenous Herceptin. Total trastuzumab clearance increases with decreasing concentrations due to parallel linear and non-linear elimination pathways. Although the average trastuzumab exposure was higher following the first cycle in breast cancer patients receiving the once every three week schedule compared to the weekly schedule of Herceptin, the average steady-state exposure was essentially the same at both dosages. The average trastuzumab exposure following the first cycle and at steady state as well as the time to steady state was higher in breast cancer patients compared to MGC patients at the same dosage; however, the reason for this exposure difference is unknown. Additional predicted trastuzumab exposure and PK parameters following the first Herceptin cycle and at steady state exposure are described in Tables 7 and 8 , respectively. Population PK based simulations indicate that following discontinuation of Herceptin, concentrations in at least 95% of breast cancer and MGC patients will decrease to approximately 3% of the population predicted steady-state trough serum concentration (approximately 97% washout) by 7 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] .

The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab in patients with severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease with or without hemodialysis, or hepatic impairment is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies There have been no formal drug interaction studies performed with Herceptin in humans. Clinically significant interactions between Herceptin and concomitant medications used in clinical trials have not been observed. Paclitaxel and doxorubicin : Concentrations of paclitaxel and doxorubicin and their major metabolites (i.e., 6-\u03b1 hydroxyl-paclitaxel [POH], and doxorubicinol [DOL], respectively) were not altered in the presence of trastuzumab when used as combination therapy in clinical trials. Trastuzumab concentrations were not altered as part of this combination therapy. Docetaxel and carboplatin: When Herceptin was administered in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin, neither the plasma concentrations of docetaxel or carboplatin nor the plasma concentrations of trastuzumab were altered. Cisplatin and capecitabine : In a drug interaction substudy conducted in patients in ToGA, the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin, capecitabine and their metabolites were not altered when administered in combination with Herceptin. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of HERCEPTIN or of other trastuzumab products. Among 903 women with metastatic breast cancer, human anti human antibody (HAHA) to Herceptin was detected in one patient using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This patient did not experience an allergic reaction. Samples for assessment of HAHA were not collected in studies of adjuvant breast cancer. The clinical relevance of the development of anti-trastuzumab antibodies after treatment with HERCEPTIN is not known."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Herceptin has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Herceptin is a mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro , Herceptin-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Herceptin exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic responses are not fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effects of trastuzumab on electrocardiographic (ECG) endpoints, including QTc interval duration, were evaluated in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. Trastuzumab had no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval duration and there was no apparent relationship between serum trastuzumab concentrations and change in QTcF interval duration in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was evaluated in a pooled population pharmacokinetic (PK) model analysis of 1,582 subjects with primarily breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) receiving intravenous Herceptin. Total trastuzumab clearance increases with decreasing concentrations due to parallel linear and non-linear elimination pathways. Although the average trastuzumab exposure was higher following the first cycle in breast cancer patients receiving the once every three week schedule compared to the weekly schedule of Herceptin, the average steady-state exposure was essentially the same at both dosages. The average trastuzumab exposure following the first cycle and at steady state as well as the time to steady state was higher in breast cancer patients compared to MGC patients at the same dosage; however, the reason for this exposure difference is unknown. Additional predicted trastuzumab exposure and PK parameters following the first Herceptin cycle and at steady state exposure are described in Tables 7 and 8 , respectively. Population PK based simulations indicate that following discontinuation of Herceptin, concentrations in at least 95% of breast cancer and MGC patients will decrease to approximately 3% of the population predicted steady-state trough serum concentration (approximately 97% washout) by 7 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] .

The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab in patients with severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease with or without hemodialysis, or hepatic impairment is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies There have been no formal drug interaction studies performed with Herceptin in humans. Clinically significant interactions between Herceptin and concomitant medications used in clinical trials have not been observed. Paclitaxel and doxorubicin : Concentrations of paclitaxel and doxorubicin and their major metabolites (i.e., 6-\u03b1 hydroxyl-paclitaxel [POH], and doxorubicinol [DOL], respectively) were not altered in the presence of trastuzumab when used as combination therapy in clinical trials. Trastuzumab concentrations were not altered as part of this combination therapy. Docetaxel and carboplatin: When Herceptin was administered in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin, neither the plasma concentrations of docetaxel or carboplatin nor the plasma concentrations of trastuzumab were altered. Cisplatin and capecitabine : In a drug interaction substudy conducted in patients in ToGA, the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin, capecitabine and their metabolites were not altered when administered in combination with Herceptin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adjuvant Breast Cancer The safety and efficacy of Herceptin in women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2 overexpressing breast cancer were evaluated in an integrated analysis of two randomized, open-label, clinical trials (NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831) with a total of 4063 women at the protocol-specified final overall survival analysis, a third randomized, open-label, clinical trial (HERA) with a total of 3386 women at definitive Disease-Free Survival analysis for one-year Herceptin treatment versus observation, and a fourth randomized, open-label clinical trial with a total of 3222 patients (BCIRG006). NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 In NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by IHC) or gene amplification (by FISH). HER2 testing was verified by a central laboratory prior to randomization (NCCTG N9831) or was required to be performed at a reference laboratory (NSABP B31). Patients with a history of active cardiac disease based on symptoms, abnormal electrocardiographic, radiologic, or left ventricular ejection fraction findings or uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic > 100 mm Hg or systolic > 200 mm Hg) were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (AC\u2192paclitaxel) alone or paclitaxel plus Herceptin (AC\u2192paclitaxel + Herceptin). In both trials, patients received four 21-day cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 . Paclitaxel was administered either weekly (80 mg/m 2 ) or every 3 weeks (175 mg/m 2 ) for a total of 12 weeks in NSABP B31; paclitaxel was administered only by the weekly schedule in NCCTG N9831. Herceptin was administered at 4 mg/kg on the day of initiation of paclitaxel and then at a dose of 2 mg/kg weekly for a total of 52 weeks. Herceptin treatment was permanently discontinued in patients who developed congestive heart failure, or persistent/recurrent LVEF decline [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after the completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure of the combined efficacy analysis was Disease-Free Survival (DFS), defined as the time from randomization to recurrence, occurrence of contralateral breast cancer, other second primary cancer, or death. An additional efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). A total of 3752 patients were included in the joint efficacy analysis of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC\u2192paclitaxel + Herceptin arm. The pre-planned final OS analysis from the joint analysis included 4063 patients and was performed when 707 deaths had occurred after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC\u2192paclitaxel + Herceptin arm. The data from both arms in NSABP B31 and two of the three study arms in NCCTG N9831 were pooled for efficacy analyses. The patients included in the DFS analysis had a median age of 49 years (range, 22\u201380 years; 6% > 65 years), 84% were White, 7% Black, 4% Hispanic, and 4% Asian/Pacific Islander. Disease characteristics included 90% infiltrating ductal histology, 38% T1, 91% nodal involvement, 27% intermediate and 66% high grade pathology, and 53% ER+ and/or PR+ tumors. HERA In HERA, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by IHC) or gene amplification (by FISH) as determined at a central laboratory. Patients with node-negative disease were required to have \u2265 T1c primary tumor. Patients with a history of congestive heart failure or LVEF < 55%, uncontrolled arrhythmias, angina requiring medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, poorly controlled hypertension (systolic > 180 mm Hg or diastolic > 100 mm Hg) were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) upon completion of definitive surgery, and at least four cycles of chemotherapy to receive no additional treatment, or one year of Herceptin treatment or two years of Herceptin treatment. Patients undergoing a lumpectomy had also completed standard radiotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ disease received systemic adjuvant hormonal therapy at investigator discretion. Herceptin was administered with an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg once every three weeks. The major efficacy outcome measure was Disease-Free Survival (DFS), defined as in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831. HERA was designed to compare one and two years of once every three week Herceptin treatment versus observation in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery, established chemotherapy and radiotherapy (if applicable). A protocol specified interim efficacy analysis comparing one-year Herceptin treatment to observation was performed at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months in the Herceptin arm. Among the 3386 patients randomized to the observation (n = 1693) and Herceptin one-year (n = 1693) treatment arms, the median age was 49 years (range 21\u201380), 83% were White, and 13% were Asian. Disease characteristics: 94% infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 50% ER+ and/or PgR+, 57% node positive, 32% node negative, and in 11% of patients, nodal status was not assessable due to prior neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Ninety-six percent (1055/1098) of patients with node-negative disease had high-risk features: among the 1098 patients with node-negative disease, 49% (543) were ER\u2013 and PgR\u2013, and 47% (512) were ER and/or PgR+ and had at least one of the following high-risk features: pathological tumor size greater than 2 cm, Grade 2\u20133, or age < 35 years. Prior to randomization, 94% of patients had received anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. After the DFS results comparing observation to one-year Herceptin treatment were disclosed, a prospectively planned analysis that included comparison of one year versus two years of Herceptin treatment at a median follow-up duration of 8 years was performed. Based on this analysis, extending Herceptin treatment for a duration of two years did not show additional benefit over treatment for one year [Hazard Ratios of two-years Herceptin versus one-year Herceptin treatment in the intent to treat (ITT) population for Disease-Free Survival (DFS) = 0.99 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.13), p-value = 0.90 and Overall Survival (OS) = 0.98 (0.83, 1.15); p-value = 0.78]. BCIRG006 In BCIRG006, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 gene amplification (FISH+ only) as determined at a central laboratory. Patients were required to have either node-positive disease, or node-negative disease with at least one of the following high-risk features: ER/PR-negative, tumor size > 2 cm, age < 35 years, or histologic and/or nuclear Grade 2 or 3. Patients with a history of CHF, myocardial infarction, Grade 3 or 4 cardiac arrhythmia, angina requiring medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease, poorly controlled hypertension (diastolic > 100 mm Hg), any T4 or N2, or known N3 or M1 breast cancer were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (AC-T), doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel plus Herceptin (AC-TH), or docetaxel and carboplatin plus Herceptin (TCH). In both the AC-T and AC-TH arms, doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 were administered every 3 weeks for four cycles; docetaxel 100 mg/m 2 was administered every 3 weeks for four cycles. In the TCH arm, docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 and carboplatin (at a target AUC of 6 mg/mL/min as a 30- to 60-minute infusion) were administered every 3 weeks for six cycles. Herceptin was administered weekly (initial dose of 4 mg/kg followed by weekly dose of 2 mg/kg) concurrently with either T or TC, and then every 3 weeks (6 mg/kg) as monotherapy for a total of 52 weeks. Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. Disease-Free Survival (DFS) was the major efficacy outcome measure. Among 3222 patients, the median age was 49 (range 22 to 74 years; 6% \u2265 65 years). Disease characteristics included 54% ER+ and/or PR+ and 71% node positive. Prior to randomization, all patients underwent primary surgery for breast cancer. The results for DFS for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, HERA, and BCIRG006 and OS results for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and HERA are presented in Table 9 . For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the duration of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC\u2192TH arm is presented in Figure 4 , and the duration of OS after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC\u2192TH arm is presented in Figure 5 . The duration of DFS for BCIRG006 is presented in Figure 6 . For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the OS hazard ratio was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.74). At 8.3 years of median follow-up [AC\u2192TH], the survival rate was estimated to be 86.9% in the AC\u2192TH arm and 79.4% in the AC\u2192T arm. The final OS analysis results from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 indicate that OS benefit by age, hormone receptor status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size and grade, and surgery/radiation therapy was consistent with the treatment effect in the overall population. In patients \u2264 50 years of age (n = 2197), the OS hazard ratio was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81) and in patients > 50 years of age (n = 1866), the OS hazard ratio was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (ER-positive and/or PR-positive) (n = 2223), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (ER-negative and PR-negative) (n = 1830), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.80). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size \u2264 2 cm (n = 1604), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.71). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size > 2 cm (n = 2448), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.80).

The results are shown in Table 10 . The number of events in NCCTG N9831 was small with the exception of the IHC 3+/FISH+ subgroup, which constituted 81% of those with data. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding efficacy within other subgroups due to the small number of events. The number of events in HERA was adequate to demonstrate significant effects on DFS in the IHC 3+/FISH unknown and the FISH+/IHC unknown subgroups.

Both trials studied patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein. Patients were eligible if they had 2 or 3 levels of overexpression (based on a 0 to 3 scale) by immunohistochemical assessment of tumor tissue performed by a central testing lab. Previously Untreated Metastatic Breast Cancer (H0648g) H0648g was a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted in 469 women with metastatic breast cancer who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Tumor specimens were tested by IHC (Clinical Trial Assay, CTA) and scored as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+, with 3+ indicating the strongest positivity. Only patients with 2+ or 3+ positive tumors were eligible (about 33% of those screened). Patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or in combination with Herceptin given intravenously as a 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by weekly doses of Herceptin at 2 mg/kg. For those who had received prior anthracycline therapy in the adjuvant setting, chemotherapy consisted of paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 over 3 hours every 21 days for at least six cycles); for all other patients, chemotherapy consisted of anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC: doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 or epirubicin 75 mg/m 2 plus 600 mg/m 2 cyclophosphamide every 21 days for six cycles). Sixty-five percent of patients randomized to receive chemotherapy alone in this study received Herceptin at the time of disease progression as part of a separate extension study. Based upon the determination by an independent response evaluation committee, the patients randomized to Herceptin and chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer median time to disease progression (TTP), a higher overall response rate (ORR), and a longer median duration of response (DoR) as compared with patients randomized to chemotherapy alone. Patients randomized to Herceptin and chemotherapy also had a longer median overall survival (OS) (see Table 11 ). These treatment effects were observed both in patients who received Herceptin plus paclitaxel and in those who received Herceptin plus AC; however, the magnitude of the effects was greater in the paclitaxel subgroup.

Of 222 patients enrolled, 66% had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy, 68% had received two prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease, and 25% had received prior myeloablative treatment with hematopoietic rescue. Patients were treated with a loading dose of 4 mg/kg IV followed by weekly doses of Herceptin at 2 mg/kg IV. The ORR (complete response + partial response), as determined by an independent Response Evaluation Committee, was 14%, with a 2% complete response rate and a 12% partial response rate. Complete responses were observed only in patients with disease limited to skin and lymph nodes. The overall response rate in patients whose tumors tested as CTA 3+ was 18% while in those that tested as CTA 2+, it was 6%. 14.3 Metastatic Gastric Cancer The safety and efficacy of Herceptin in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil) were studied in patients previously untreated for metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (ToGA). In this open-label, multi-center trial, 594 patients were randomized 1:1 to Herceptin in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (FC+H) or chemotherapy alone (FC). Randomization was stratified by extent of disease (metastatic vs. locally advanced), primary site (gastric vs. gastroesophageal junction), tumor measurability (yes vs. no), ECOG performance status (0,1 vs. 2), and fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine vs. 5-fluorouracil). All patients were either HER2 gene amplified (FISH+) or HER2 overexpressing (IHC 3+). Patients were also required to have adequate cardiac function (e.g., LVEF > 50%). On the Herceptin-containing arm, Herceptin was administered as an IV infusion at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression. On both study arms cisplatin was administered at a dose of 80 mg/m 2 Day 1 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles as a 2 hour IV infusion. On both study arms, capecitabine was administered at 1000 mg/m 2 dose orally twice daily (total daily dose 2000 mg/m 2 ) for 14 days of each 21 day cycle for 6 cycles. Alternatively, continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) 5-fluorouracil was administered at a dose of 800 mg/m 2 /day from Day 1 through Day 5 every three weeks for 6 cycles. The median age of the study population was 60 years (range: 21\u201383); 76% were male; 53% were Asian, 38% Caucasian, 5% Hispanic, 5% other racial/ethnic groups; 91% had ECOG PS of 0 or 1; 82% had primary gastric cancer and 18% had primary gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Of these patients, 23% had undergone prior gastrectomy, 7% had received prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy, and 2% had received prior radiotherapy. The main outcome measure of ToGA was overall survival (OS), analyzed by the unstratified log-rank test. The final OS analysis based on 351 deaths was statistically significant (nominal significance level of 0.0193). An updated OS analysis was conducted at one year after the final analysis. The efficacy results of both the final and the updated analyses are summarized in Table 13 and Figure 7 .

Repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of less than 40% or absolute decrease from baseline of greater than 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) Permanently discontinue ENHERTU. 2.4 Preparation and Administration In order to prevent medication errors, check the vial labels to ensure that the drug being prepared and administered is ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) and not trastuzumab or ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Reconstitute and further dilute ENHERTU prior to intravenous infusion. Use appropriate aseptic technique. ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Reconstitution Reconstitute immediately before dilution. More than one vial may be needed for a full dose. Calculate the dose (mg), the total volume of reconstituted ENHERTU solution required, and the number of vial(s) of ENHERTU needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Reconstitute each 100 mg vial by using a sterile syringe to slowly inject 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP into each vial to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/mL. Swirl the vial gently until completely dissolved. Do not shake . If not used immediately, store the reconstituted ENHERTU vials in a refrigerator at 2\u00baC to 8\u00baC (36\u00baF to 46\u00baF) for up to 24 hours from the time of reconstitution, protect the vial from light. Do not freeze . The product does not contain a preservative. Discard unused ENHERTU after 24 hours refrigerated. Dilution Withdraw the calculated amount from the vial(s) using a sterile syringe. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. The solution should be clear and colorless to light yellow. Do not use if visible particles are observed or if the solution is cloudy or discolored. Dilute the calculated volume of reconstituted ENHERTU in an intravenous infusion bag containing 100 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP . DO NOT use Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. ENHERTU is compatible with an infusion bag made of polyvinylchloride or polyolefin (copolymer of ethylene and polypropylene). Gently invert the infusion bag to thoroughly mix the solution. Do not shake . Cover the infusion bag to protect from light. Discard any unused portion left in the vials. Administration If not used immediately, store the diluted ENHERTU in a refrigerator at 2\u00baC to 8\u00baC (36\u00baF to 46\u00baF) for up to 24 hours or at room temperature between 20\u00baC to 25\u00baC (68\u00baF to 77 \u00baF) for up to 4 hours including preparation and infusion time. Protect from light. Do not freeze . The maximum time from reconstitution of the vial through the end of administration should not exceed 24 hours. If the prepared infusion solution was stored refrigerated (2\u00baC to 8\u00baC [36\u00baF to 46\u00baF]), allow the solution to reach room temperature prior to administration. Cover the infusion bag to protect from light. Administer ENHERTU as an intravenous infusion only with an infusion set made of polyolefin or polybutadiene. Administer ENHERTU with a 0.20 or 0.22 micron in-line polyethersulfone (PES) or polysulfone (PS) filter. Do NOT administer as an intravenous push or bolus. Cover the infusion bag to protect from light during administration. Do not mix ENHERTU with other drugs or administer other drugs through the same intravenous line. First infusion: Administer infusion over 90 minutes. Subsequent infusions: Administer over 30 minutes if prior infusions were well tolerated."

Manage through treatment interruption or dose reduction. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) Left Ventricular Dysfunction: Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage through treatment interruption or discontinuation. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF). ( 2.3 , 5.3 ) 5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU monotherapy or ENHERTU in combination with pertuzumab [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic (Grade 1) ILD, consider corticosteroid treatment (e.g., \u22650.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). Withhold ENHERTU until recovery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In cases of symptomatic ILD (Grade 2 or greater), promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment (e.g., \u22651 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients who are diagnosed with symptomatic (Grade 2 or greater) ILD [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . HER2-Positive, HER2-Low, and HER2-Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2-Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) ENHERTU as Monotherapy In patients treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: 0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with ENHERTU. ENHERTU in Combination with Pertuzumab In patients treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in combination with pertuzumab (N=431), ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 8.0 months (range: 0.6 to 33.8). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 0.5% of patients treated with ENHERTU in combination with pertuzumab. HER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg) In patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2 to 21). 5.2 Neutropenia Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU monotherapy or ENHERTU in combination with pertuzumab. Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . HER2-Positive, HER2-Low, and HER2-Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2-Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) ENHERTU as Monotherapy In patients treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Nineteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients. ENHERTU in Combination with Pertuzumab In patients treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in combination with pertuzumab (N=431), decreased neutrophil count occurred in 79% of patients. Median time to first onset was 22 days (range: 5 to 994). Twenty-nine percent had Grades 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Febrile neutropenia was reported in 2.6% of patients. HER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg) In patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty-one percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients. 5.3 Left Ventricular Dysfunction Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of less than 40% or absolute decrease from baseline of greater than 20% is confirmed. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF less than 50% prior to initiation of treatment. HER2-Positive, HER2-Low, and HER2-Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2-Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) ENHERTU as Monotherapy In patients treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 4.6% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3 or 4. ENHERTU in Combination with Pertuzumab In patients treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in combination with pertuzumab (N=431), LVEF decrease was reported in 11% of patients, of which 2.1% were Grade 3 or 4. HER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg) In patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on echocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In postmarketing reports, use of a HER2-directed antibody during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Based on its mechanism of action, the topoisomerase inhibitor component of ENHERTU, DXd, can also cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because it is genotoxic and targets actively dividing cells [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Verify pregnancy status of females prior to initiation of ENHERTU. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action, ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of ENHERTU in pregnant women. In postmarketing reports, use of a HER2-directed antibody during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death ( see Data ). Based on its mechanism of action, the topoisomerase inhibitor component of ENHERTU, DXd, can also cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because it is genotoxic and targets actively dividing cells [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU ( see Clinical Considerations ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received ENHERTU during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. Data Human Data There are no available data on the use of ENHERTU in pregnant women. In postmarketing reports in pregnant women receiving a HER2-directed antibody, cases of oligohydramnios manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death have been reported. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received a HER2-directed antibody either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In some case reports, amniotic fluid index increased after use of a HER2-directed antibody was stopped. Animal Data There were no animal reproductive or developmental toxicity studies conducted with fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data regarding the presence of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception Females ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Based on findings in animal toxicity studies, ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. Animal Data Juvenile animal studies have not been conducted with fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki. In a six-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, intravenous administration of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki resulted in incisor tooth toxicity including single cell necrosis in the base area (e.g., ameloblasts, odontoblasts) and degeneration of the enamel at \u226560 mg/kg (approximately \u22659 times the human recommended dose of 5.4 mg/kg based on AUC), abnormal formation or hypoplasia of the dentin, hemorrhage in the sub-enamel organ tissue, and focal lack of the cementum at 197 mg/kg (approximately 19 times the human recommended dose of 5.4 mg/kg based on AUC). Degeneration of the enamel organ, abnormal dentin formation, hemorrhage in the sub-enamel organ tissue, focal lack of the cementum, and root fracture were observed at 197 mg/kg following a 9-week recovery period. 8.5 Geriatric Use ENHERTU as Monotherapy Of the 2355 patients with HER2-positive, HER2-low, or HER2-ultralow breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 23% were 65 years or older and 5% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients \u226565 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged 65 years or older (55%) as compared to younger patients (50%). Of the 101 patients with HER2-mutant unresectable or metastatic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were 65 years or older and 8% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients \u226565 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Gastric01, 56% were 65 years or older and 14% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients \u226565 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2-positive (IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-PanTumor02, DESTINY-Lung01 or DESTINY-CRC02, 39% were 65 years or older and 9% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients \u226565 years of age compared to younger patients. ENHERTU in Combination with Pertuzumab In patients with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in combination with pertuzumab (N=431), 17% were 65 years or older and 3% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients \u226565 years of age compared to younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of ENHERTU is required in patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] \u226560 and <90 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr \u226530 and <60 mL/min) renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment of ENHERTU is required in patients with mild (total bilirubin \u2264ULN and any AST >ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) or moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of three components: 1) a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), covalently linked to 2) a topoisomerase inhibitor, via 3) a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker. Deruxtecan is composed of a protease-cleavable maleimide tetrapeptide linker and the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd, which is an exatecan derivative. The antibody is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology, and the topoisomerase inhibitor and linker are produced by chemical synthesis. Approximately 8 molecules of deruxtecan are attached to each antibody molecule. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki has the following structure: ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) is a sterile, white to yellowish white, preservative-free lyophilized powder in single-dose vials. Each vial delivers 100 mg of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, L-histidine (4.45 mg), L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (20.2 mg), polysorbate 80 (1.5 mg), and sucrose (450 mg). Following reconstitution with 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the resulting concentration of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is 20 mg/mL with a pH of 5.5. The resulting solution is administered by intravenous infusion following dilution. Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate. The antibody is a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1. The small molecule, DXd, is a topoisomerase I inhibitor attached to the antibody by a cleavable linker. Following binding to HER2 on tumor cells, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki undergoes internalization and intracellular linker cleavage by lysosomal enzymes. Upon release, the membrane-permeable DXd causes DNA damage and apoptotic cell death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationships Exposure relationship for efficacy has not been fully characterized. Higher systemic exposure to fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was associated with a higher incidence rate of any grade ILD. Cardiac Electrophysiology The administration of multiple doses of ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks did not show a large mean effect (i.e., >20 ms) on the QTc interval in an open-label, single-arm study in 51 patients with metastatic HER2-positive cancer. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was evaluated in patients with cancer. Following a single dose, exposures (C max and AUC) of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and released topoisomerase inhibitor (DXd) increased proportionally over a dose range of 3.2 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg (approximately 0.6 to 1.5 times the recommended dose in breast cancer, NSCLC, and HER2-positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors and 0.5 to 1.25 times the recommended dose in gastric cancer). At the recommended dosage of ENHERTU for patients with metastatic breast cancer, NSCLC, and HER2-positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors, the geometric mean (coefficient of variation [CV]%) C max of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were 132 \u00b5g/mL (20%) and 4.7 ng/mL (48%), respectively, and the AUC of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were 772 \u00b5g\u2219day/mL (27%) and 29 ng\u2219day/mL (48%), respectively. Accumulation of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was approximately 35% at steady-state (Cycle 3). At the recommended dosage of ENHERTU for patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer, the geometric mean C max,ss of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were 126 \u00b5g/mL (18%) and 5.2 ng/mL (42%), respectively, and the AUC ss of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were 743 \u00b5g\u2219day/mL (26%) and 33 ng\u2219day/mL (43%), respectively. Accumulation of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was approximately 39% at steady-state (Cycle 3). Distribution The estimated volume of distribution of the central compartment (V c ) of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was 2.68 L. DXd plasma protein binding is approximately 97% and the blood-to-plasma ratio is approximately 0.6, in vitro. Elimination The median elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is 5.4-5.7 days. The estimated systemic clearance of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was 0.41 L/day. The median elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of DXd is 5.4-6.1 days. The estimated systemic clearance of DXd was 18.3 L/h. Metabolism The humanized HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. In vitro, DXd is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki or DXd were observed for age (20-96 years); race (Asian vs Non-Asian), including White, and Black or African American; sex; body weight (27.3-125.4 kg); tumor types; mild hepatic impairment; mild or moderate renal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki or DXd in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on DXd: Coadministration of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, with multiple doses of ENHERTU increased steady state AUC 0-17 days of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki by 11% and DXd by 18%. The impact of these changes is not clinically meaningful. Effect of OATP Inhibitors on DXd: Coadministration of ritonavir, a dual inhibitor of OATP1B/CYP3A, with multiple doses of ENHERTU increased steady state AUC 0-17 days of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki by 19% and DXd by 22%. The impact of these changes is not clinically meaningful. In Vitro Studies Effects of DXd on CYP Enzymes: DXd does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A nor induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A. Effects of DXd on Transporters: At clinically relevant concentrations (steady-state C max of ~0.2 \u03bcmol/L), DXd has a low potential to inhibit OAT1 (IC 50 value of 12.7 \u03bcmol/L), OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1 (IC 50 value of 14.4 \u03bcmol/L), OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K, P-gp, BCRP, or BSEP transporters. Effects of Other Drugs on DXd: DXd is a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE2-K, P-gp, MRP1, and BCRP. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described below with the incidence of ADA in other studies, including those of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki or of other fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan products. Among patients who received ENHERTU as a single agent over a 6 to 9 month treatment period in 13 clinical trials, anti-fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki antibodies developed in 2.2% (49/2,231) of patients who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg every three weeks and in 2.6% (21/793) of patients who received ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg every three weeks . Among patients who received ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg every three weeks) in combination with pertuzumab for a median of 16 months in 2 clinical trials, anti-fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki antibodies developed in 7.7% (33/426) of patients. These anti-drug antibodies have no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or safety of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki. Because of the low occurrence of anti-drug antibodies, the effect of antibodies on the effectiveness of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki products is unknown. Among patients with anti-drug antibodies, neutralizing antibodies against fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki were detected in 6% (4/70) of patients who received ENHERTU as a single agent (5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks) and in 18% (6/33) of patients who received ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks) in combination with pertuzumab."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer DESTINY-Breast09 The efficacy of ENHERTU in combination with pertuzumab was evaluated in DESTINY-Breast09 (NCT04784715), a randomized, three-arm, multicenter, global study that enrolled 1157 adult patients with HER2-positive advanced, or metastatic breast cancer who had not received prior chemotherapy or HER2-targeted therapy or had received neoadjuvant or adjuvant HER2-targeted therapy more than 6 months before the diagnosis of advanced or metastatic disease. A single line of prior endocrine therapy was permitted for advanced or metastatic breast cancer. HER2 expression was confirmed at a central laboratory using PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody and HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail with HER2 positivity defined as HER2 IHC 3+ or ISH positive. Patients were excluded for a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or ILD/pneumonitis at screening, patients with symptomatic brain metastases, or ECOG performance status >1, and patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either, ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg plus pertuzumab (N=383), THP (taxane [docetaxel or paclitaxel], trastuzumab, and pertuzumab) (N=387), or an investigational therapy (N=387) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive disease (N=416) were allowed to receive concurrent endocrine therapy after 6 cycles of ENHERTU or after discontinuation of the taxane in the THP arm; this occurred in 13.5% of patients in the ENHERTU in the combination with pertuzumab arm and in 38.3% of patients in the THP arm. Randomization was stratified by prior treatment status (de novo vs recurrent), hormone receptor status, and PIK3CA mutation status. The major efficacy outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and confirmed objective response rate (ORR) assessed by BICR. The median age was 54 years (range: 20-88); 82% were <65 years; 100% were female; 50% of the patients were Asian, 37% were White, 2% were American Indian or Alaska Native, and 3% were Black or African American; 14% were Hispanic or Latino; 8% other or race unknown; 52% had de novo disease and 48% had recurrent disease; 53% were HR-positive and 47% HR-negative; and 31% of patients had a PIK3CA mutation. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomized to ENHERTU in combination with pertuzumab compared to THP. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 22 and Figure 1. At the time of the PFS analysis, OS data was not mature with 126 (16%) of patients who died across both study arms in the overall population.

HER2 expression was based on archival tissue tested at a central laboratory prior to enrollment with HER2 positivity defined as HER2 IHC 3+ or ISH positive. Patients were excluded for a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids, ILD/pneumonitis at screening, or clinically significant cardiac disease. Patients were also excluded for untreated and symptomatic brain metastases, ECOG performance status >1, or prior treatment with an anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugate in the metastatic setting.

Patients were excluded for a history of treated ILD or current ILD at screening. Patients were also excluded for history of clinically significant cardiac disease, active brain metastases, and ECOG performance status >1. HER2 expression was based on archival tissue tested at a central laboratory prior to enrollment with HER2 positivity defined as HER2 IHC 3+ or ISH positive. Patients received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Tumor imaging was obtained every 6 weeks and CT/MRI of the brain was mandatory for patients with brain metastases at baseline. The major efficacy outcomes were confirmed objective response rate (ORR) assessed by independent central review (ICR) using RECIST v1.1 and duration of response (DOR). The median age was 55 years (range: 28-96); 76% of patients were <65 years. All 184 patients were female, and the majority were White (55%) or Asian (38%). Patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (55%) or 1 (44%) at baseline. Ninety-two percent had visceral disease, 29% had bone metastases, and 13% had brain metastases. Fifty-three percent were HR+. Sum of diameters of target lesions were <5 cm in 42%, and \u22655 cm in 50% (not evaluable by central review in 8% of patients). The median number of prior cancer regimens in the locally advanced/metastatic setting was 5 (range: 2-17). All patients received prior trastuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, and 66% had prior pertuzumab. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 25.

HER2-ultralow is defined as membrane staining that is seen in >0 and \u226410% of tumor cells. Patients were eligible if they had disease progression on (a) at least 2 lines of endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting or (b) one line of endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting and demonstrated progression within 24 months of the start of adjuvant endocrine therapy, or within 6 months of starting first line endocrine therapy in combination with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor in the metastatic setting. Patients with prior chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting were eligible if they had a disease-free interval greater than 12 months. The study excluded patients with prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease, patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or ILD/pneumonitis at screening, uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, untreated and symptomatic brain metastases, or ECOG performance status >1. Patients were randomized to receive either ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg (N=436) by intravenous infusion every three weeks or physician's choice of single agent chemotherapy (N=430, capecitabine 60%, nab-paclitaxel 24%, or paclitaxel 16%). Randomization was stratified by prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use (yes or no), prior taxane use in the non-metastatic setting (yes or no), and HER2 IHC status of tumor samples (IHC 2+/ISH- vs IHC 1+ vs IHC 0 with membrane staining). Treatment with ENHERTU was administered until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS in patients with HER2-low breast cancer assessed by BICR based on RECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS assessed by BICR based on RECIST v1.1 in the overall population, OS in HER2-low patients, and OS in the overall population. The median age was 57 years (range: 28 to 87); 31% were age 65 or older; 99.9% were female; 53% were White, 35% were Asian, 0.8% were Black or African American, 0.1% were American Indian or Alaska Native, and 7% were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (59%) or 1 (39%) at baseline; 18% were IHC 0 with membrane staining, 55% were IHC 1+, 27% were IHC 2+/ISH-; 67% had liver metastases, 32% had lung metastases, 8% had brain metastases, and 3% had bone-only metastases. Patients had a median of 2 prior lines of endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting (range: 1 to 5) with 17% having 1 and 68% having 2. Eighty-nine percent of patients had prior endocrine therapy in combination with CDK4/6i treatment in the metastatic setting, 41% had prior taxane use in the non-metastatic setting. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 26 and Figure 6. At the time of the PFS final analysis, overall survival (OS) data was immature, and a total of 335 (39%) of patients had died across both study arms in the overall population.

Confirmed ORR (BICR) was 65.7% (95% CI: 53.1, 76.8) and 30.8% (95% CI: 19.9, 43.4) in patients randomized to ENHERTU and chemotherapy and with measurable disease at baseline, respectively. Median DOR was 14.3 months (95% CI: 11.8, not estimable) and 14.1 months (95% CI: 5.9, not estimable) in patients randomized to ENHERTU and chemotherapy, respectively. Figure 6: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Progression Free Survival (Overall Population) Figure 6 DESTINY-Breast04 The efficacy of ENHERTU was evaluated in study DESTINY-Breast04 (NCT03734029), a randomized, multicenter, open-label study that enrolled 557 adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low breast cancer. The study included 2 cohorts: 494 hormone receptor-positive (HR+) patients and 63 hormone receptor-negative (HR-) patients. HER2-low expression was defined as IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-, as determined at a central laboratory using Ventana's PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay. Patients must have received chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or have developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients who were HR+ must have received at least one endocrine therapy or be ineligible for endocrine therapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg (N=373) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks or physician's choice of chemotherapy (N=184, eribulin, capecitabine, gemcitabine, nab paclitaxel, or paclitaxel). Randomization was stratified by HER2 IHC status of tumor samples (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-), number of prior lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (1 or 2), and HR status/prior CDK4/6i treatment (HR+ with prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, HR+ without prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, or HR-). Treatment was administered until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. The study excluded patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or ILD/pneumonitis at screening and clinically significant cardiac disease. Patients were also excluded for untreated or symptomatic brain metastases or ECOG performance status >1. The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS in patients with HR+ breast cancer assessed by BICR based on RECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS assessed by BICR based on RECIST v1.1 in the overall population (all randomized HR+ and HR- patients), OS in HR+ patients, and OS in the overall population. The median age was 57 years (range: 28 to 81); 24% were age 65 or older; 99.6% were female; 48% were White, 40% were Asian, and 2% were Black or African American; 3.8% of patients were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (55%) or 1 (45%) at baseline; 58% were IHC 1+, 42% were IHC 2+/ISH-; 70% had liver metastases, 33% had lung metastases, and 6% had brain metastases. In the metastatic setting, patients had a median of 3 prior lines of systemic therapy (range: 1 to 9) with 58% having 1 and 41% having 2 prior chemotherapy regimens; 3.9% were early progressors (progression in the neo/adjuvant setting). In HR+ patients, the median number of prior lines of endocrine therapy was 2 (range: 0 to 9) and 70% had prior CDK4/6i treatment. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 27 and Figures 7 and 8.

Patients were prospectively selected for treatment with ENHERTU based on the presence of activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutations by local testing using tissue. Samples from DESTINY-Lung01 were retrospectively tested using Oncomine \u2122 Dx Target Test (Life Technologies Corporation, Tissue-test) and Guardant360 \u00ae CDx test (Guardant Health Inc., Plasma test). Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar for patients in DESTINY-Lung01 and DESTINY-Lung02, except for race (34% Asian vs 79% Asian, respectively). Response rates were consistent across dose levels. Increased rates of ILD/pneumonitis were observed at the higher dose. The approved recommended dose of 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in the DESTINY-Lung02 study is described below [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The efficacy of ENHERTU was evaluated in DESTINY-Lung02, a multicenter, multicohort, randomized, blinded, dose-optimization trial. Eligible patients were required to have unresectable or metastatic HER2-mutant non-squamous NSCLC with disease progression after one prior systemic therapy. Patients with a history of steroid dependent ILD/pneumonitis, clinically significant cardiac disease, clinically active brain metastases, and ECOG performance status >1 were excluded. Patients received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor imaging was obtained every 6 weeks and CT/MRI of the brain was mandatory for patients with stable brain metastases at baseline. Results from an interim efficacy analysis in a pre-specified patient cohort are described below. The major efficacy outcomes were confirmed ORR as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1 and DOR. The median age was 58 years (range 30 to 78); 69% were female; 79% were Asian, 12% were White, and 10% were other races; 29% had an ECOG performance status of 0 and 71% had 1; 33% had stable brain metastases; 94% had a mutation in the ERBB2 kinase domain and 6% had a mutation in the extracellular domain. The median number of prior regimens was 2 (range: 1 to 12); 100% of patients received prior platinum therapy, 71% received prior immunotherapy, and 44% received both in combination. Fifty percent of patients were never-smokers and 50% were former smokers; 96% of patients had adenocarcinoma histology. Efficacy results are provided in Table 28.

HER2 expression was determined by a central lab on tissue obtained either before or after prior trastuzumab treatment. Patients were excluded for a history of treated or current ILD, a history of clinically significant cardiac disease, active brain metastases, or ECOG performance status >1. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive ENHERTU (N=126) 6.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks or physician's choice of chemotherapy: irinotecan monotherapy (N=55) 150 mg/m 2 intravenously every 2 weeks or paclitaxel monotherapy (N=7) 80 mg/m 2 intravenously weekly. Randomization was stratified by HER2 status (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+), ECOG performance status (0 or 1), and region (Japan or South Korea). Tumor imaging assessments were performed at screening and every 6 weeks from the first treatment dose. Treatment was administered until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The major efficacy outcomes were ORR assessed by ICR according to RECIST v1.1 and OS in the intent-to-treat population. Additional efficacy outcomes were PFS and DOR. The median age was 66 years (range 28 to 82); 76% were male; and 100% were Asian. All patients received a trastuzumab product. Patients had an ECOG performance status of either 0 (49%) or 1 (51%); 87% had gastric adenocarcinoma and 13% had GEJ adenocarcinoma; 76% were IHC 3+ and 23% were IHC 2+/ISH+; 65% had inoperable advanced cancer; 35% had postoperative recurrent cancer; 54% had liver metastases; 29% had lung metastases; 45% had three or more prior regimens in the locally advanced or metastatic setting. A total of 30% of patients were identified as HER2-positive using tissue obtained following prior treatment with a trastuzumab product. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 29, and the Kaplan-Meier curve for OS is shown in Figure 9.

All three studies excluded patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or ILD/pneumonitis at screening and clinically significant cardiac disease. Patients were also excluded for active brain metastases or ECOG performance status >1. Patients received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every three weeks. Treatment was administered until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure in all three of the studies was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) and an additional efficacy outcome measure was duration of response (DOR). All outcomes were assessed by independent central review (ICR) based on RECIST v1.1. DESTINY-PanTumor02 DESTINY-PanTumor02 (NCT04482309) was a multicenter, multicohort, open-label trial that included 111 adult patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+ by either local or central assessment) solid tumors that progressed following at least one prior systemic regimen in the advanced/metastatic setting or that had no satisfactory alternative treatment option. The median age was 64 years (range 23 to 85); 59% were female; 58% were White, 34% were Asian, and 4% were Black or African American; 3% of patients were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Patients had an ECOG performance status of either 0 (49%) or 1 (51%) at baseline. The median number of prior regimens in any treatment setting was 2. DESTINY-Lung01 DESTINY-Lung01 (NCT03505710) was a multicenter, open-label, 2-cohort trial that included 17 patients with previously treated, unresectable, or metastatic, centrally confirmed HER2-positive (IHC 3+) NSCLC. Patients must have relapsed from or be refractory to standard treatment or have no available standard treatment. The median age was 59 years (range 31 to 74); 59% were male; 65% were White, 18% were Asian, and 12% were Black or African American. Patients had an ECOG performance status of either 0 (12%) or 1 (88%) at baseline. The median number of prior regimens in any treatment setting was 3. DESTINY-CRC02 DESTINY-CRC02 (NCT04744831) was a multicenter, randomized, 2-arm trial that included 64 patients with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic centrally confirmed HER2-positive (IHC 3+) colorectal cancer (CRC). Unless contraindicated, patients must have received fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. If clinically indicated, patients must have received anti-EGFR treatment, anti-VEGF treatment and anti-PDL1 therapy. The median age was 58 years (range 25 to 78); 53% were male; 55% were Asian and 41% were White; 1.6% of patients were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Patients had an ECOG performance status of either 0 (58%) or 1 (42%) at baseline. The median number of prior regimens in any treatment setting was 4. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 30 and Table 31.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous (IV) infusion only. Do not administer as an IV push or bolus. KANJINTI has different dosage and administration instructions than subcutaneous trastuzumab products. ( 2.3 ) Do not substitute KANJINTI (trastuzumab-anns) for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. ( 2.3 ) Perform HER2 testing using FDA-approved tests by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. ( 1 , 2.2 ) Adjuvant Treatment of HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer ( 2.2 ) Administer at either: Initial dose of 4 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion, then 2 mg/kg over 30 minutes IV infusion weekly for 12 weeks (with paclitaxel or docetaxel) or 18 weeks (with docetaxel and carboplatin). One week after the last weekly dose of KANJINTI, administer 6 mg/kg as an IV infusion over 30\u221290 minutes every three weeks to complete a total of 52 weeks of therapy, or Initial dose of 8 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion, then 6 mg/kg over 30\u201390 minutes IV infusion every three weeks for 52 weeks. Metastatic HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer ( 2.3 ) Initial dose of 4 mg/kg as a 90 minutes IV infusion followed by subsequent weekly doses of 2 mg/kg as 30 minutes IV infusions. Metastatic HER2-Overexpressing Gastric Cancer ( 2.3 ) Initial dose of 8 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion, followed by 6 mg/kg over 30 to 90 minutes IV infusion every 3 weeks. 2.1 Evaluation and Testing Before Initiating KANJINTI Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of KANJINTI and at regular intervals during treatment [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of KANJINTI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] . 2.2 Patient Selection Select patients based on HER2 protein overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in tumor specimens [see Indications and Usage (1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . Assessment of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification should be performed using FDA-approved tests specific for breast or gastric cancers by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. Information on the FDA-approved tests for the detection of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. Assessment of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification in metastatic gastric cancer should be performed using FDA-approved tests specifically for gastric cancers due to differences in gastric vs. breast histopathology, including incomplete membrane staining and more frequent heterogeneous expression of HER2 seen in gastric cancers. Improper assay performance, including use of suboptimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents, deviation from specific assay instructions, and failure to include appropriate controls for assay validation, can lead to unreliable results. 2.3 Recommended Dosage KANJINTI is for intravenous infusion only. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. KANJINTI has different dosage and administration instructions than subcutaneous trastuzumab products. Do not mix KANJINTI with other drugs. Do not substitute KANJINTI (trastuzumab-anns) for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer: Administer according to one of the following doses and schedules for a total of 52 weeks of KANJINTI therapy: During and following paclitaxel, docetaxel, or docetaxel and carboplatin: Initial dose of 4 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes then at 2 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes weekly during chemotherapy for the first 12 weeks (paclitaxel or docetaxel) or 18 weeks (docetaxel and carboplatin). One week following the last weekly dose of KANJINTI, administer KANJINTI at 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30\u201390 minutes every three weeks. As a single agent within three weeks following completion of multi-modality, anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens: Initial dose at 8 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes. Subsequent doses at 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30-90 minutes every three weeks . Extending adjuvant treatment beyond one year is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Metastatic Breast Cancer: Administer KANJINTI, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, at an initial dose of 4 mg/kg as a 90-minute intravenous infusion followed by subsequent once weekly doses of 2 mg/kg as 30-minute intravenous infusions until disease progression. Metastatic Gastric Cancer: Administer KANJINTI at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg as a 90-minute intravenous infusion followed by subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30-90 minutes every three weeks until disease progression . 2.4 Important Dosing Considerations Missed Dose If the patient has missed a dose of KANJINTI by one week or less, then the usual maintenance dose (weekly schedule: 2 mg/kg; once every three weeks schedule: 6 mg/kg) should be administered as soon as possible. Do not wait until the next planned cycle. Subsequent KANJINTI maintenance doses should be administered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or once every three week schedules, respectively. If the patient has missed a dose of KANJINTI by more than one week, a re-loading dose of KANJINTI should be administered over approximately 90 minutes (weekly schedule: 4 mg/kg; once every three week schedule: 8 mg/kg) as soon as possible. Subsequent KANJINTI maintenance doses (weekly schedule: 2 mg/kg; three-weekly schedule 6 mg/kg) should be administered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or once every three week schedules, respectively. 2.5 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Infusion Reactions [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Decrease the rate of infusion for mild or moderate infusion reactions Interrupt the infusion in patients with dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension Discontinue KANJINTI for severe or life-threatening infusion reactions. Cardiomyopathy [ s ee Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of KANJINTI and at regular intervals during treatment. Withhold KANJINTI dosing for at least 4 weeks for either of the following: \u2265 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values LVEF below institutional limits of normal and \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values. KANJINTI may be resumed if, within 4\u20138 weeks, the LVEF returns to normal limits and the absolute decrease from baseline is \u2264 15%. Permanently discontinue KANJINTI for a persistent (> 8 weeks) LVEF decline or for suspension of KANJINTI dosing on more than 3 occasions for cardiomyopathy. 2.6 Preparation Instructions To prevent medication errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the drug being prepared and administered is KANJINTI (trastuzumab-anns) and not ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. 420 mg Multiple-dose vial Reconstitution Reconstitute each 420 mg vial of KANJINTI with 20 mL of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection (BWFI), USP, containing 0.9% to 1.1% benzyl alcohol as a preservative to yield a multiple-dose solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-anns that delivers 20 mL (420 mg trastuzumab-anns). In patients with known hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol, reconstitute with 20 mL of Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) without preservative to yield a one-time use solution. Use appropriate aseptic technique when performing the following reconstitution steps: Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject the 20 mL of diluent into the vial containing the lyophilized powder of KANJINTI, which has a cake-like appearance. The stream of diluent should be directed into the cake. The reconstituted vial yields a solution for multiple-dose use, containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-anns. Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE. Slight foaming of the product may be present upon reconstitution. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect visually for particulates and discoloration. The solution should be free of visible particulates, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. Store reconstituted KANJINTI in the refrigerator at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F); discard unused KANJINTI after 28 days. If KANJINTI is reconstituted with SWFI without preservative, use immediately and discard any unused portion. Do not freeze. Dilution Determine the dose (mg) of KANJINTI [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Calculate the volume of the 21 mg/mL reconstituted KANJINTI solution needed, withdraw this amount from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. DO NOT USE DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. The solution of KANJINTI for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, should be stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for no more than 24 hours prior to use. This storage time is additional to the time allowed for the reconstituted vials. Do not freeze . 150 mg Single-dose vial Reconstitution Reconstitute each 150 mg vial of KANJINTI with 7.4 mL of Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) (not supplied) to yield a single-dose solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-anns that delivers 7.15 mL (150 mg trastuzumab-anns). Use appropriate aseptic technique when performing the following reconstitution steps: Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 7.4 mL of SWFI (not supplied) into the vial containing the lyophilized powder of KANJINTI, which has a cake-like appearance. The stream of diluent should be directed into the cake. The reconstituted vial yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-anns. Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE. Slight foaming of the product may be present upon reconstitution. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect visually for particulates and discoloration. The solution should be free of visible particulates, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. Use the KANJINTI solution immediately following reconstitution with SWFI, as it contains no preservatives and is intended for one-time use only. If not used immediately, store the reconstituted KANJINTI solution for up to 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) ; discard any unused KANJINTI after 24 hours. Do not freeze . Dilution Determine the dose (mg) of KANJINTI [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Calculate the volume of the 21 mg/mL reconstituted KANJINTI solution needed. Withdraw this amount from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. DO NOT USE DEXTROSE 5% SOLUTION. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. The solution of KANJINTI for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, should be stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for no more than 24 hours prior to use. Discard after 24 hours. This storage time is additional to the time allowed for the reconstituted vials. Do not freeze."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) 5.1 Cardiomyopathy Trastuzumab products can cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death [see Boxed Warning: Cardiomyopathy ] . Trastuzumab products can also cause asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). There is a 4\u20136 fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction among patients receiving trastuzumab products as a single agent or in combination therapy compared with those not receiving trastuzumab products. The highest absolute incidence occurs when a trastuzumab product is administered with an anthracycline. Withhold KANJINTI for \u2265 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values or an LVEF value below institutional limits of normal and \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab products in patients with trastuzumab product-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied. Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping trastuzumab products may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Cardiac Monitoring Conduct thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan. The following schedule is recommended: Baseline LVEF measurement immediately prior to initiation of KANJINTI LVEF measurements every 3 months during and upon completion of KANJINTI Repeat LVEF measurement at 4-week intervals if KANJINTI is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] LVEF measurements every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of KANJINTI as a component of adjuvant therapy. In NSABP B31, 15% (158/1031) of patients discontinued trastuzumab due to clinical evidence of myocardial dysfunction or significant decline in LVEF after a median follow-up duration of 8.7 years in the AC-TH (anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab) arm. In HERA (one-year trastuzumab treatment), the number of patients who discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up was 2.6% (44/1678). In BCIRG006, a total of 2.9% (31/1056) of patients in the TCH (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab) arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 1.4% during the monotherapy phase) and 5.7% (61/1068) of patients in the AC-TH arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 4.2% during the monotherapy phase) discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity. Among 64 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831) who developed congestive heart failure, one patient died of cardiomyopathy, one patient died suddenly without documented etiology and 33 patients were receiving cardiac medication at last follow-up. Approximately 24% of the surviving patients had recovery to a normal LVEF (defined as \u2265 50%) and no symptoms on continuing medical management at the time of last follow-up. Incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) is presented in Table 1. The safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab products in patients with trastuzumab product-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied. Table 1.

In post-marketing reports, serious and fatal infusion reactions have been reported. Severe reactions, which include bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypoxia, and severe hypotension, were usually reported during or immediately following the initial infusion. However, the onset and clinical course were variable, including progressive worsening, initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration, or delayed post-infusion events with rapid clinical deterioration. For fatal events, death occurred within hours to days following a serious infusion reaction. Interrupt KANJINTI infusion in all patients experiencing dyspnea, clinically significant hypotension, and intervention of medical therapy administered (which may include epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, bronchodilators, and oxygen). Patients should be evaluated and carefully monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Permanent discontinuation should be strongly considered in all patients with severe infusion reactions. There are no data regarding the most appropriate method of identification of patients who may safely be retreated with trastuzumab products after experiencing a severe infusion reaction. Prior to resumption of trastuzumab infusion, the majority of patients who experienced a severe infusion reaction were pre-medicated with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. While some patients tolerated trastuzumab infusions, others had recurrent severe infusion reactions despite pre-medications. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of KANJINTI. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to KANJINTI during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of KANJINTI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Trastuzumab product use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity. 5.5 Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3\u20134 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Cardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Infusion Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Pulmonary Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Adjuvant Breast Cancer Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, and chills. ( 6.1 ) Metastatic Breast Cancer Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) are fever, chills, headache, infection, congestive heart failure, insomnia, cough, and rash. ( 6.1 ) Metastatic Gastric Cancer Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) are neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amgen Medical Information at 1-800-77-AMGEN (1-800-772-6436) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving trastuzumab products in the adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer setting are fever, nausea, vomiting, infusion reactions, diarrhea, infections, increased cough, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, neutropenia, anemia, and myalgia. Adverse reactions requiring interruption or discontinuation of trastuzumab product treatment include CHF, significant decline in left ventricular cardiac function, severe infusion reactions, and pulmonary toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . In the metastatic gastric cancer setting, the most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) that were increased (\u2265 5% difference) in the trastuzumab arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. The most common adverse reactions which resulted in discontinuation of treatment on the trastuzumab-containing arm in the absence of disease progression were infection, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia. Adjuvant Breast Cancer The information below reflects exposure to one-year trastuzumab therapy across three randomized, open-label studies, NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, and HERA, with (n = 3678) or without (n = 3363) trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. HERA Table 3 reflects exposure to trastuzumab in 1678 patients in HERA; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks and median number of infusions was 18 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Table 3. Adverse Reactions (\u2265 1%) in HERA (All Grades) The incidence of Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions was < 1% in both arms for each listed term. Adverse Reactions Trastuzumab (n = 1678) % Observation (n = 1708) % Nervous System Headache 10 3 Paresthesia 2 0.6 Musculoskeletal Arthralgia 8 6 Back Pain 5 3 Myalgia 4 1 Bone Pain 3 2 Muscle Spasm 3 0.2 Infections Nasopharyngitis 8 3 Urinary tract infection 3 0.8 Gastrointestinal Diarrhea 7 1 Nausea 6 1 Vomiting 3.5 0.6 Constipation 2 1 Dyspepsia 2 0.5 Upper abdominal pain 2 1 General Pyrexia 6 0.4 Peripheral edema 5 2 Chills 5 0 Asthenia 4.5 2 Influenza-like illness 2 0.2 Respiratory Thoracic Mediastinal Cough 5 2 Influenza 4 0.5 Dyspnea 3 2 URI 3 1 Rhinitis 2 0.4 Pharyngolaryngeal pain 2 0.5 Sinusitis 2 0.3 Epistaxis 2 0.06 Cardiac Hypertension 4 2 Dizziness 4 2 Ejection fraction decreased 3.5 0.6 Palpitations 3 0.7 Cardiac arrhythmias Higher level grouping term. 3 1 Cardiac failure (congestive) 2 0.3 Skin & Subcutaneous Tissue Rash 4 0.6 Nail disorders 2 0 Pruritus 2 0.6 Clinically relevant adverse reactions in < 1% of patients who received trastuzumab in HERA included hypersensitivity (0.6%), cardiac failure (0.5%), cardiac disorder (0.3%), interstitial pneumonitis (0.2%), pulmonary hypertension (0.2%), ventricular disorder (0.2%), autoimmune thyroiditis (0.3%), and sudden death (0.06%). Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer with Trastuzumab Beyond One Year Extending adjuvant treatment beyond one year is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. In HERA, a comparison of trastuzumab administered once every 3 weeks for two years versus one year was performed. The rate of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was increased in the 2-year trastuzumab compared to the 1-year trastuzumab treatment arm (8.1% versus 4.6%, respectively). More patients experienced at least one adverse reaction of Grade 3 or higher in the 2-year trastuzumab treatment arm (20.4%) compared with the one-year trastuzumab treatment arm (16.3%). NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 The safety data from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 were obtained from 3655 patients, of whom 2000 received trastuzumab; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In NSABP B31, only Grade 3\u20135 adverse events, treatment-related Grade 2 events, and Grade 2\u20135 dyspnea were collected during and for up to 3 months following protocol-specified treatment. The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2\u20135 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: fatigue (29.5% vs. 22.4%), infection (24% vs. 12.8%), hot flashes (17.1% vs. 15%), anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7%), dyspnea (11.8% vs. 4.6%), rash/desquamation (10.9% vs. 7.6%), leukopenia (10.5% vs. 8.4%), neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3%), headache (6.2% vs. 3.8%), pain (5.5% vs. 3%), edema (4.7% vs. 2.7%) and insomnia (4.3% vs. 1.5%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. In NCCTG N9831, data collection was limited to the following investigator-attributed treatment-related adverse reactions: NCI-CTC Grade 4 and 5 hematologic toxicities, Grade 3-5 non-hematologic toxicities, selected Grade 2\u20135 toxicities associated with taxanes (myalgia, arthralgias, nail changes, motor neuropathy, sensory neuropathy) and Grade 1\u20135 cardiac toxicities occurring during chemotherapy and/or trastuzumab treatment. The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2\u20135 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: arthralgia (12.2% vs. 9.1%), nail changes (11.5% vs.6.8%), dyspnea (2.4% vs. 0.2%), and diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. BCIRG006 Safety data from BCIRG006 reflect exposure to trastuzumab as part of an adjuvant treatment regimen from 2124 patients receiving at least one dose of study treatment [AC-TH: n = 1068; TCH: n = 1056]. The overall median treatment duration was 54 weeks in both the AC-TH and TCH arms. The median number of infusions was 26 in the AC-TH arm and 30 in the TCH arm, including weekly infusions during the chemotherapy phase and once every three week dosing in the monotherapy period [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In BCIRG006, the toxicity profile was similar to that reported in NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, and HERA with the exception of a lower incidence of CHF in the TCH arm. Metastatic Breast Cancer Studies The safety of trastuzumab was evaluated in one randomized, open-label study (H0648g) of chemotherapy with (n = 235) or without (n = 234) intravenous trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer and in one single-arm study (H0649g) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (n = 222) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients received 4 mg/kg initial dose of trastuzumab followed by 2 mg/kg weekly. In H0648g, 58% of patients received trastuzumab for \u2265 6 months and 9% received trastuzumab \u2265 12 months, respectively. In H0649g, 31% of patients received trastuzumab for \u2265 6 months and 16% received trastuzumab for \u2265 12 months, respectively. Table 4 shows the adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) in patients from H0648g and H0649g. Table 4.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (FC+H) (n = 294) or chemotherapy alone (FC) (n = 290). Patients in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm received trastuzumab 8 mg/kg administered on Day 1 (prior to chemotherapy) followed by 6 mg/kg every 21 days until disease progression. Cisplatin was administered at 80 mg/m 2 on Day 1 and the fluoropyrimidine was administered as either capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 orally twice a day on Days 1-14 or 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m 2 /day as a continuous intravenous infusion Days 1 through 5. Chemotherapy was administered for six 21-day cycles. Median duration of trastuzumab treatment was 21 weeks and the median number of trastuzumab infusions administered was eight. Table 5.

Cardiomyopathy Serial measurement of cardiac function (LVEF) was obtained in clinical trials in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. In HERA, the median duration of follow-up was12.6 months (12.4 months in the observation arm; 12.6 months in the 1-year trastuzumab arm); and in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, 7.9 years in the AC-T arm, 8.3 years in the AC-TH arm. Following initiation of trastuzumab therapy, the incidence of new-onset dose-limiting myocardial dysfunction was higher among patients receiving trastuzumab and paclitaxel as compared to those receiving paclitaxel alone in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and in patients receiving one-year trastuzumab monotherapy compared to observation in HERA (see Table 6 , Figures 1 and 2 ). The incidence of new-onset cardiac dysfunction, as measured by LVEF, remained similar when compared to the analysis performed at a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC-TH arm. This analysis showed evidence of reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction, with 64.5% of patients who experienced symptomatic CHF in the AC-TH group being asymptomatic at latest follow-up, and 90.3% having full or partial LVEF recovery.

Figure 3. BCIRG006: Cumulative Incidence of Time to First LVEF Decline of \u2265 10 Percentage Points from Baseline and to Below 50% with Death as a Competing Risk Event The incidence of congestive heart failure among patients in the metastatic breast cancer trials was classified for severity using the New York Heart Association classification system (I-IV, where IV is the most severe level of cardiac failure) (see Table 2 ). In the metastatic breast cancer trials, the probability of cardiac dysfunction was highest in patients who received trastuzumab concurrently with anthracyclines. In ToGA, 5% of patients in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm compared to 1.1% of patients in the chemotherapy alone arm had LVEF value below 50% with a \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Infusion Reactions During the first infusion with trastuzumab, the symptoms most commonly reported were chills and fever, occurring in approximately 40% of patients in clinical trials. Symptoms were treated with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and meperidine (with or without reduction in the rate of trastuzumab infusion); permanent discontinuation of trastuzumab for infusion reactions was required in < 1% of patients. Other signs and/or symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), rigors, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, elevated blood pressure, rash, and asthenia. Infusion reactions occurred in 21% and 35% of patients, and were severe in 1.4% and 9% of patients, on second or subsequent trastuzumab infusions administered as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, respectively. In the post-marketing setting, severe infusion reactions, including hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and angioedema have been reported. Anemia In randomized controlled clinical trials, the overall incidence of anemia (30% vs. 21% [H0648g]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2\u20135 anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7% [NSABP B31]), and of anemia requiring transfusions (0.1% vs. 0 patients [NCCTG N9831]) were increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Following the administration of trastuzumab as a single agent (H0649g), the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 anemia was < 1%. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer), on the trastuzumab-containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the overall incidence of anemia was 28% compared to 21% and of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 anemia was 12.2% compared to 10.3%. Neutropenia In randomized controlled clinical trials in the adjuvant setting, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 4\u20135 neutropenia (1.7% vs. 0.8% [NCCTG N9831]) and of selected Grade 2-5 neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3% [NSABP B31]) were increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. In a randomized, controlled trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia (32% vs. 22%) and of febrile neutropenia (23% vs. 17%) were also increased in patients randomized to trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer) on the trastuzumab-containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 36.8% compared to 28.9%; febrile neutropenia 5.1% compared to 2.8%. Infection The overall incidences of infection (46% vs. 30% [H0648g]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2\u20135 infection/febrile neutropenia (24.3% vs. 13.4% [NSABP B31]) and of selected Grade 3\u20135 infection/febrile neutropenia (2.9% vs. 1.4%) [NCCTG N9831]) were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. The most common site of infections in the adjuvant setting involved the upper respiratory tract, skin, and urinary tract. In BCIRG006, the overall incidence of infection was higher with the addition of trastuzumab to AC-T but not to TCH [44% (AC-TH), 37% (TCH), 38% (AC-T)]. The incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3-4 infection were similar [25% (AC-TH), 21% (TCH), 23% (AC-T)] across the three arms. In a randomized, controlled trial in treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the reported incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher (23% vs. 17%) in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. Pulmonary Toxicity Adjuvant Breast Cancer Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2-5 pulmonary toxicity (14.3% vs. 5.4% [NSABP B31]) and of selected NCI-CTC Grade 3\u20135 pulmonary toxicity and spontaneous reported Grade 2 dyspnea (3.4% vs. 0.9% [NCCTG N9831]) was higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. The most common pulmonary toxicity was dyspnea (NCI-CTC Grade 2\u20135: 11.8% vs. 4.6% [NSABP B31]; NCI-CTC Grade 2\u20135: 2.4% vs. 0.2% [NCCTG N9831]). Pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving trastuzumab compared with 0.3% of those receiving chemotherapy alone. Fatal respiratory failure occurred in 3 patients receiving trastuzumab, one as a component of multi-organ system failure, as compared to 1 patient receiving chemotherapy alone. In HERA, there were 4 cases of interstitial pneumonitis in the one-year trastuzumab treatment arm compared to none in the observation arm at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months. Metastatic Breast Cancer Among women receiving trastuzumab for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the incidence of pulmonary toxicity was also increased. Pulmonary adverse events have been reported in the post-marketing experience as part of the symptom complex of infusion reactions. Pulmonary events include bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. For a detailed description, [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Thrombosis/Embolism In 4 randomized, controlled clinical trials, the incidence of thrombotic adverse events was higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in three studies (2.6% vs. 1.5% [NSABP B31], 2.5% and 3.7% vs. 2.2% [BCIRG006] and 2.1% vs. 0% [H0648g]). Diarrhea Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 2\u20135 diarrhea (6.7% vs. 5.4% [NSABP B31]) and of NCI-CTC Grade 3\u20135 diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0% [NCCTG N9831]), and of Grade 1\u20134 diarrhea (7% vs. 1% [HERA; one-year trastuzumab treatment at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up]) were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab as compared to controls. In BCIRG006, the incidence of Grade 3\u20134 diarrhea was higher [5.7% AC-TH, 5.5% TCH vs. 3.0% AC-T] and of Grade 1\u20134 was higher [51% AC-TH, 63% TCH vs. 43% AC-T] among women receiving trastuzumab. Of patients receiving trastuzumab as a single agent for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, 25% experienced diarrhea. An increased incidence of diarrhea was observed in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Renal Toxicity In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer) on the trastuzumab-containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm the incidence of renal impairment was 18% compared to 14.5%. Severe (Grade 3/4) renal failure was 2.7% on the trastuzumab-containing arm compared to 1.7% on the chemotherapy only arm. Treatment discontinuation for renal insufficiency/failure was 2% on the trastuzumab-containing arm and 0.3% on the chemotherapy only arm. In the post-marketing setting, rare cases of nephrotic syndrome with pathologic evidence of glomerulopathy have been reported. The time to onset ranged from 4 months to approximately 18 months from initiation of trastuzumab therapy. Pathologic findings included membranous glomerulonephritis, focal glomerulosclerosis, and fibrillary glomerulonephritis. Complications included volume overload and congestive heart failure. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of trastuzumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infusion reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Oligohydramnios or oligohydramnios sequence, including pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Glomerulopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Immune thrombocytopenia Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Cases of possible TLS have been reported in patients treated with trastuzumab products. Patients with significant tumor burden (e.g. bulky metastases) may be at a higher risk. Patients could present with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS. Providers should consider additional monitoring and/or treatment as clinically indicated."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Verify the pregnancy status of females prior to initiation of KANJINTI ( 8.3 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Data ]. Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if a trastuzumab product is used in a pregnant woman or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of a trastuzumab product [see Clinical Considerations ]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received KANJINTI during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal/neonatal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. Data Human Data In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence. Fetal manifestations included pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities and neonatal death. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received trastuzumab either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In most reported cases, amniotic fluid index increased after trastuzumab was stopped. In reported cases where trastuzumab therapy was resumed after amniotic index improved, oligohydramnios recurred. Animal Data In studies where trastuzumab was administered to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (up to 25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early (Gestation Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation. The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of trastuzumab products in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Published data suggest human IgG is present in human milk but does not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts. Trastuzumab was present in the milk of lactating Cynomolgus monkeys but not associated with neonatal toxicity [see Data ]. Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's clinical need for KANJINTI treatment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from KANJINTI or from the underlying maternal condition. This consideration should also take into account the trastuzumab product wash out period of 7 months [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Data In lactating Cynomolgus monkeys, trastuzumab was present in breast milk at about 0.3% of maternal serum concentrations after pre- (beginning Gestation Day 120) and post-partum (through Post-partum Day 28) doses of 25 mg/kg administered twice weekly (25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg of trastuzumab products). Infant monkeys with detectable serum levels of trastuzumab did not exhibit any adverse effects on growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of KANJINTI. Contraception Females Trastuzumab products can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KANJINTI and for 7 months following the last dose of KANJINTI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of KANJINTI in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Trastuzumab has been administered to 386 patients who were 65 years of age or over (253 in the adjuvant treatment and 133 in metastatic breast cancer treatment settings). The risk of cardiac dysfunction was increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger patients in both those receiving treatment for metastatic disease in H0648g and H0649g, or adjuvant therapy in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831. Limitations in data collection and differences in study design of the 4 studies of trastuzumab in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer preclude a determination of whether the toxicity profile of trastuzumab in older patients is different from younger patients. The reported clinical experience is not adequate to determine whether the efficacy improvements (ORR, TTP, OS, DFS) of trastuzumab treatment in older patients is different from that observed in patients < 65 years of age for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer), of the 294 patients treated with trastuzumab, 108 (37%) were 65 years of age or older, while 13 (4.4%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Trastuzumab-anns is a humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein, HER2. Trastuzumab-anns is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture containing the antibiotic geneticin. Geneticin is not detectable in the final product. KANJINTI (trastuzumab-anns) for injection is a sterile, white to pale yellow, preservative-free lyophilized powder with a cake-like appearance, for intravenous administration. Each multiple-dose vial of KANJINTI delivers 420 mg trastuzumab-anns, 381.8 mg \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose dihydrate, 9.5 mg L-histidine HCl monohydrate, 6.1 mg L-histidine, and 1.7 mg polysorbate 20. Reconstitution with 20 mL of the appropriate diluent (BWFI or SWFI) yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-anns that delivers 20 mL (420 mg trastuzumab-anns), at a pH of approximately 6. If KANJINTI is reconstituted with SWFI without preservative, the reconstituted solution is considered single-dose. Each single-dose vial of KANJINTI delivers 150 mg trastuzumab-anns, 136.2 mg \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose dihydrate, 3.4 mg L-histidine HCl monohydrate, 2.2 mg L-histidine, and 0.6 mg polysorbate 20. Reconstitution with 7.4 mL of Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-anns that delivers 7.15 mL (150 mg trastuzumab-anns), at a pH of approximately 6."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Trastuzumab products have been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Trastuzumab products are mediators of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro , trastuzumab product-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2-overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Trastuzumab product exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic responses are not fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effects of trastuzumab on electrocardiographic (ECG) endpoints, including QTc interval duration, were evaluated in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. Trastuzumab had no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval duration and there was no apparent relationship between serum trastuzumab concentrations and change in QTcF interval duration in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was evaluated in a pooled population pharmacokinetic (PK) model analysis of 1582 subjects with primarily breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) receiving intravenous trastuzumab. Total trastuzumab clearance increases with decreasing concentrations due to parallel linear and non-linear elimination pathways. Although the average trastuzumab exposure was higher following the first cycle in breast cancer patients receiving the once every three week schedule compared to the weekly schedule of trastuzumab, the average steady-state exposure was essentially the same at both dosages. The average trastuzumab exposure following the first cycle and at steady-state as well as the time to steady-state was higher in breast cancer patients compared to MGC patients at the same dosage; however, the reason for this exposure difference is unknown. Additional predicted trastuzumab exposure and PK parameters following the first trastuzumab cycle and at steady-state exposure are described in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. Population PK based simulations indicate that following discontinuation of trastuzumab, concentrations in at least 95% of breast cancer and MGC patients will decrease to approximately 3% of the population predicted steady-state trough serum concentration (approximately 97% washout) by 7 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] .

The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab products in patients with severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease with or without hemodialysis, or hepatic impairment is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies: There have been no formal drug interaction studies performed with trastuzumab products in humans. Clinically significant interactions between trastuzumab and concomitant medications used in clinical trials have not been observed. Paclitaxel and doxorubicin : Concentrations of paclitaxel and doxorubicin and their major metabolites (i.e., 6-\u03b1 hydroxyl-paclitaxel [POH], and doxorubicinol [DOL], respectively) were not altered in the presence of trastuzumab when used as combination therapy in clinical trials. Trastuzumab concentrations were not altered as part of this combination therapy. Docetaxel and carboplatin: When trastuzumab was administered in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin, neither the plasma concentrations of docetaxel or carboplatin nor the plasma concentrations of trastuzumab were altered. Cisplatin and capecitabine : In a drug interaction substudy conducted in patients in ToGA, the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin, capecitabine and their metabolites were not altered when administered in combination with trastuzumab. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of trastuzumab or of other trastuzumab products. Among 903 women with metastatic breast cancer, human anti-human antibody (HAHA) to trastuzumab was detected in one patient using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This patient did not experience an allergic reaction. Samples for assessment of HAHA were not collected in studies of adjuvant breast cancer. The clinical relevance of the development of anti-trastuzumab antibodies after treatment with trastuzumab is not known."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Trastuzumab products have been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Trastuzumab products are mediators of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro , trastuzumab product-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2-overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2."

Cardiac Electrophysiology The effects of trastuzumab on electrocardiographic (ECG) endpoints, including QTc interval duration, were evaluated in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. Trastuzumab had no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval duration and there was no apparent relationship between serum trastuzumab concentrations and change in QTcF interval duration in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was evaluated in a pooled population pharmacokinetic (PK) model analysis of 1582 subjects with primarily breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) receiving intravenous trastuzumab. Total trastuzumab clearance increases with decreasing concentrations due to parallel linear and non-linear elimination pathways. Although the average trastuzumab exposure was higher following the first cycle in breast cancer patients receiving the once every three week schedule compared to the weekly schedule of trastuzumab, the average steady-state exposure was essentially the same at both dosages. The average trastuzumab exposure following the first cycle and at steady-state as well as the time to steady-state was higher in breast cancer patients compared to MGC patients at the same dosage; however, the reason for this exposure difference is unknown. Additional predicted trastuzumab exposure and PK parameters following the first trastuzumab cycle and at steady-state exposure are described in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. Population PK based simulations indicate that following discontinuation of trastuzumab, concentrations in at least 95% of breast cancer and MGC patients will decrease to approximately 3% of the population predicted steady-state trough serum concentration (approximately 97% washout) by 7 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] .

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adjuvant Breast Cancer The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab in women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-overexpressing breast cancer were evaluated in an integrated analysis of two randomized, open-label, clinical trials (NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831) with a total of 4063 women at the protocol-specified final overall survival analysis, a third randomized, open-label, clinical trial (HERA) with a total of 3386 women at definitive Disease-Free Survival analysis for one-year trastuzumab treatment versus observation, and a fourth randomized, open-label clinical trial with a total of 3222 patients (BCIRG006). NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 In NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by IHC) or gene amplification (by FISH). HER2 testing was verified by a central laboratory prior to randomization (NCCTG N9831) or was required to be performed at a reference laboratory (NSABP B31). Patients with a history of active cardiac disease based on symptoms, abnormal electrocardiographic, radiologic, or left ventricular ejection fraction findings or uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic > 100 mm Hg or systolic > 200 mm Hg) were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (AC\u2192paclitaxel) alone or paclitaxel plus trastuzumab (AC\u2192paclitaxel + trastuzumab). In both trials, patients received four 21-day cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 . Paclitaxel was administered either weekly (80 mg/m 2 ) or every 3 weeks (175 mg/m 2 ) for a total of 12 weeks in NSABP B31; paclitaxel was administered only by the weekly schedule in NCCTG N9831. Trastuzumab was administered at 4 mg/kg on the day of initiation of paclitaxel and then at a dose of 2 mg/kg weekly for a total of 52 weeks. Trastuzumab treatment was permanently discontinued in patients who developed congestive heart failure, or persistent/recurrent LVEF decline [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after the completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure of the combined efficacy analysis was Disease-Free Survival (DFS), defined as the time from randomization to recurrence, occurrence of contralateral breast cancer, other second primary cancer, or death. An additional efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). A total of 3752 patients were included in the joint efficacy analysis of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC\u2192paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm. The pre-planned final OS analysis from the joint analysis included 4063 patients and was performed when 707 deaths had occurred after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC\u2192paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm. The data from both arms in NSABP B31 and two of the three study arms in NCCTG N9831 were pooled for efficacy analyses. The patients included in the DFS analysis had a median age of 49 years (range: 22\u201380 years; 6% > 65 years), 84% were white, 7% black, 4% Hispanic, and 4% Asian/Pacific Islander. Disease characteristics included 90% infiltrating ductal histology, 38% T1, 91% nodal involvement, 27% intermediate and 66% high grade pathology, and 53% ER+ and/or PR+ tumors. HERA In HERA, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by IHC) or gene amplification (by FISH) as determined at a central laboratory. Patients with node-negative disease were required to have \u2265 T1c primary tumor. Patients with a history of congestive heart failure or LVEF < 55%, uncontrolled arrhythmias, angina requiring medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, poorly controlled hypertension (systolic > 180 mm Hg or diastolic > 100 mm Hg) were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) upon completion of definitive surgery, and at least four cycles of chemotherapy to receive no additional treatment, or one year of trastuzumab treatment or two years of trastuzumab treatment. Patients undergoing a lumpectomy had also completed standard radiotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ disease received systemic adjuvant hormonal therapy at investigator discretion. Trastuzumab was administered with an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg once every three weeks. The major efficacy outcome measure was Disease-Free Survival (DFS), defined as in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831. HERA was designed to compare one and two years of once every three week trastuzumab treatment versus observation in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery, established chemotherapy and radiotherapy (if applicable). A protocol specified interim efficacy analysis comparing one-year trastuzumab treatment to observation was performed at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months in the trastuzumab arm. Among the 3386 patients randomized to the observation (n = 1693) and trastuzumab one-year (n = 1693) treatment arms, the median age was 49 years (range: 21\u201380), 83% were White, and 13% were Asian. Disease characteristics: 94% infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 50% ER+ and/or PgR+, 57% node positive, 32% node negative, and in 11% of patients, nodal status was not assessable due to prior neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Ninety-six percent (1055/1098) of patients with node-negative disease had high risk features: among the 1098 patients with node-negative disease, 49% (543) were ER\u2212 and PgR\u2212, and 47% (512) were ER and/or PgR + and had at least one of the following high risk features: pathological tumor size greater than 2 cm, Grade 2\u20133, or age < 35 years. Prior to randomization, 94% of patients had received anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. After the DFS results comparing observation to one-year trastuzumab treatment were disclosed, a prospectively planned analysis that included comparison of one year versus two years of trastuzumab treatment at a median follow-up duration of 8 years was performed. Based on this analysis, extending trastuzumab treatment for a duration of two years did not show additional benefit over treatment for one year [Hazard Ratios of two-years trastuzumab versus one-year trastuzumab treatment in the intent to treat (ITT) population for Disease-Free Survival (DFS) = 0.99 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.13), p-value = 0.90 and Overall Survival (OS) = 0.98 (0.83, 1.15); p-value = 0.78]. BCIRG006 In BCIRG006, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 gene amplification (FISH+ only) as determined at a central laboratory. Patients were required to have either node-positive disease, or node-negative disease with at least one of the following high-risk features: ER/PR-negative, tumor size > 2 cm, age < 35 years, or histologic and/or nuclear Grade 2 or 3. Patients with a history of CHF, myocardial infarction, Grade 3 or 4 cardiac arrhythmia, angina requiring medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease, poorly controlled hypertension (diastolic > 100 mm Hg), any T4 or N2 or known N3 or M1 breast cancer were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (AC-T), doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel plus trastuzumab (AC-TH), or docetaxel and carboplatin plus trastuzumab (TCH). In both the AC-T and AC-TH arms, doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 were administered every 3 weeks for four cycles; docetaxel 100 mg/m 2 was administered every 3 weeks for four cycles. In the TCH arm, docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 and carboplatin (at a target AUC of 6 mg/mL/min as a 30- to 60-minute infusion) were administered every 3 weeks for six cycles. Trastuzumab was administered weekly (initial dose of 4 mg/kg followed by weekly dose of 2 mg/kg) concurrently with either T or TC, and then every 3 weeks (6 mg/kg) as monotherapy for a total of 52 weeks. Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. Disease-Free Survival (DFS) was the major efficacy outcome measure. Among 3222 patients, the median age was 49 (range: 22 to 74 years; 6% \u2265 65 years). Disease characteristics included 54% ER+ and/or PR+ and 71% node positive. Prior to randomization, all patients underwent primary surgery for breast cancer. The results for DFS for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, HERA, and BCIRG006 and OS results for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and HERA are presented in Table 9. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the duration of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC\u2192TH arm is presented in Figure 4, and the duration of OS after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC\u2192TH arm is presented in Figure 5. The duration of DFS for BCIRG006 is presented in Figure 6. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the OS hazard ratio was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.74). At 8.3 years of median follow-up [AC\u2192TH], the survival rate was estimated to be 86.9% in the AC\u2192TH arm and 79.4% in the AC\u2192T arm. The final OS analysis results from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 indicate that OS benefit by age, hormone receptor status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size and grade, and surgery/radiation therapy was consistent with the treatment effect in the overall population. In patients \u2264 50 years of age (n = 2197), the OS hazard ratio was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81) and in patients > 50 years of age (n = 1866), the OS hazard ratio was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (ER-positive and/or PR-positive) (n = 2223), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (ER-negative and PR-negative) (n = 1830), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.80). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size \u2264 2 cm (n = 1604), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.71). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size > 2 cm (n = 2448), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.80). Table 9.

Disease-Free Survival in Patients with Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer (BCIRG006) Exploratory analyses of DFS as a function of HER2 overexpression or gene amplification were conducted for patients in NCCTG N9831 and HERA, where central laboratory testing data were available. The results are shown in Table 10. The number of events in NCCTG N9831 was small with the exception of the IHC 3+/FISH+ subgroup, which constituted 81% of those with data. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding efficacy within other subgroups due to the small number of events. The number of events in HERA was adequate to demonstrate significant effects on DFS in the IHC 3+/FISH unknown and the FISH +/IHC unknown subgroups. Table 10.

Both trials studied patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein. Patients were eligible if they had 2 or 3 levels of overexpression (based on a 0 to 3 scale) by immunohistochemical assessment of tumor tissue performed by a central testing lab. Previously Untreated Metastatic Breast Cancer (H0648g) H0648g was a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted in 469 women with metastatic breast cancer who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Tumor specimens were tested by IHC (Clinical Trial Assay, CTA) and scored as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+, with 3+ indicating the strongest positivity. Only patients with 2+ or 3+ positive tumors were eligible (about 33% of those screened). Patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or in combination with trastuzumab given intravenously as a 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by weekly doses of trastuzumab at 2 mg/kg. For those who had received prior anthracycline therapy in the adjuvant setting, chemotherapy consisted of paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 over 3 hours every 21 days for at least six cycles); for all other patients, chemotherapy consisted of anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC: doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 or epirubicin 75 mg/m 2 plus 600 mg/m 2 cyclophosphamide every 21 days for six cycles). Sixty-five percent of patients randomized to receive chemotherapy alone in this study received trastuzumab at the time of disease progression as part of a separate extension study. Based upon the determination by an independent Response Evaluation Committee the patients randomized to trastuzumab and chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer median time to disease progression (TTP), a higher overall response rate (ORR), and a longer median duration of response (DoR) as compared with patients randomized to chemotherapy alone. Patients randomized to trastuzumab and chemotherapy also had a longer median overall survival (OS) (see Table 11 ). These treatment effects were observed both in patients who received trastuzumab plus paclitaxel and in those who received trastuzumab plus AC; however, the magnitude of the effects was greater in the paclitaxel subgroup.

Of 222 patients enrolled, 66% had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy, 68% had received two prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease, and 25% had received prior myeloablative treatment with hematopoietic rescue. Patients were treated with a loading dose of 4 mg/kg IV followed by weekly doses of trastuzumab at 2 mg/kg IV. The ORR (complete response + partial response), as determined by an independent Response Evaluation Committee, was 14%, with a 2% complete response rate and a 12% partial response rate. Complete responses were observed only in patients with disease limited to skin and lymph nodes. The overall response rate in patients whose tumors tested as CTA 3+ was 18% while in those that tested as CTA 2+, it was 6%. 14.3 Metastatic Gastric Cancer The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil) were studied in patients previously untreated for metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (ToGA). In this open-label, multi-center trial, 594 patients were randomized 1:1 to trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (FC+H) or chemotherapy alone (FC). Randomization was stratified by extent of disease (metastatic vs. locally advanced), primary site (gastric vs. gastroesophageal junction), tumor measurability (yes vs. no), ECOG performance status (0,1 vs. 2), and fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine vs. 5-fluorouracil). All patients were either HER2 gene amplified (FISH+) or HER2-overexpressing (IHC 3+). Patients were also required to have adequate cardiac function (e.g. LVEF > 50%). On the trastuzumab-containing arm, trastuzumab was administered as an IV infusion at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression. On both study arms cisplatin was administered at a dose of 80 mg/m 2 Day 1 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles as a 2 hour IV infusion. On both study arms capecitabine was administered at 1000 mg/m 2 dose orally twice daily (total daily dose 2000 mg/m 2 ) for 14 days of each 21 day cycle for 6 cycles. Alternatively, continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) 5-fluorouracil was administered at a dose of 800 mg/m 2 /day from Day 1 through Day 5 every three weeks for 6 cycles. The median age of the study population was 60 years (range: 21-83); 76% were male; 53% were Asian, 38% Caucasian, 5% Hispanic, 5% other racial/ethnic groups; 91% had ECOG PS of 0 or 1; 82% had primary gastric cancer and 18% had primary gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Of these patients, 23% had undergone prior gastrectomy, 7% had received prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy, and 2% had received prior radiotherapy. The main outcome measure of ToGA was overall survival (OS), analyzed by the unstratified log-rank test. The final OS analysis based on 351 deaths was statistically significant (nominal significance level of 0.0193). An updated OS analysis was conducted at one year after the final analysis. The efficacy results of both the final and the updated analyses are summarized in Table 13 and Figure 7. Table 13.

Evaluate cardiac function prior to and during treatment. Discontinue HERZUMA for cardiomyopathy. ( 2.5 , 5.1 ) Infusion Reactions, Pulmonary Toxicity: Discontinue HERZUMA for anaphylaxis, angioedema, interstitial pneumonitis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. ( 5.2 , 5.4 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Exposure to trastuzumab products during pregnancy can result in oligohydramnios, in some cases complicated by pulmonary hypoplasia and neonatal death. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) Cardiomyopathy Administration of trastuzumab products can result in sub-clinical and clinical cardiac failure. The incidence and severity was highest in patients receiving trastuzumab with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens. Evaluate left ventricular function in all patients prior to and during treatment with HERZUMA. Discontinue HERZUMA treatment in patients receiving adjuvant therapy and withhold HERZUMA in patients with metastatic disease for clinically significant decrease in left ventricular function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Infusion Reactions; Pulmonary Toxicity Administration of trastuzumab products can result in serious and fatal infusion reactions and pulmonary toxicity. Symptoms usually occur during or within 24 hours of administration of trastuzumab products. Interrupt HERZUMA infusion for dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous (IV) infusion only. Do not administer as an IV push or bolus. HERZUMA has different dosage and administration instructions than subcutaneous trastuzumab products. ( 2.3 ) Do not substitute HERZUMA (trastuzumab-pkrb) for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. ( 2.3 ) Perform HER2 testing using FDA-approved tests by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. ( 1 , 2.2 ) Adjuvant Treatment of HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer ( 2.2 ) Administer at either: Initial dose of 4 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion, then 2 mg/kg over 30 minutes IV infusion weekly for 12 weeks (with paclitaxel or docetaxel) or 18 weeks (with docetaxel and carboplatin). One week after the last weekly dose of HERZUMA, administer 6 mg/kg as an IV infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks to complete a total of 52 weeks of therapy, or Initial dose of 8 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion, then 6 mg/kg over 30 to 90 minutes IV infusion every three weeks for 52 weeks. Metastatic HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer ( 2.3 ) Initial dose of 4 mg/kg as a 90 minutes IV infusion followed by subsequent weekly doses of 2 mg/kg as 30 minutes IV infusions. Metastatic HER2-Overexpressing Gastric Cancer ( 2.3 ) Initial dose of 8 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion, followed by 6 mg/kg over 30 to 90 minutes IV infusion every 3 weeks. 2.1 Evaluation and Testing Before Initiating HERZUMA Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of HERZUMA and at regular intervals during treatment. [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of HERZUMA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]. 2.2 Patient Selection Select patients based on HER2 protein overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in tumor specimens [see Indications and Usage (1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . Assessment of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification should be performed using FDA-approved tests specific for breast or gastric cancers by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. Information on the FDA-approved tests for the detection of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. Assessment of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification in metastatic gastric cancer should be performed using FDA-approved tests specifically for gastric cancers due to differences in gastric vs. breast histopathology, including incomplete membrane staining and more frequent heterogeneous expression of HER2 seen in gastric cancers. Improper assay performance, including use of suboptimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents, deviation from specific assay instructions, and failure to include appropriate controls for assay validation, can lead to unreliable results. 2.3 Recommended Dosage HERZUMA is for intravenous infusion only. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. HERZUMA has different dosage and administration instructions than subcutaneous trastuzumab products. Do not mix HERZUMA with other drugs. Do not substitute HERZUMA (trastuzumab-pkrb) for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer Administer according to one of the following doses and schedules for a total of 52 weeks of HERZUMA therapy: During and following paclitaxel, docetaxel, or docetaxel and carboplatin: Initial dose of 4 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes then at 2 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes weekly during chemotherapy for the first 12 weeks (paclitaxel or docetaxel) or 18 weeks (docetaxel and carboplatin). One week following the last weekly dose of HERZUMA, administer HERZUMA at 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks. As a single agent within three weeks following completion of multi-modality, anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens: Initial dose at 8 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes Subsequent doses at 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks . Extending adjuvant treatment beyond one year is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Metastatic Breast Cancer Administer HERZUMA, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, at an initial dose of 4 mg/kg as a 90-minute intravenous infusion followed by subsequent once weekly doses of 2 mg/kg as 30-minute intravenous infusions until disease progression. Metastatic Gastric Cancer Administer HERZUMA at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg as a 90-minute intravenous infusion followed by subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks until disease progression . 2.4 Important Dosing Considerations Missed Dose If the patient has missed a dose of HERZUMA by one week or less, then the usual maintenance dose (weekly schedule: 2 mg/kg; once every three week schedule: 6 mg/kg) should be administered as soon as possible. Do not wait until the next planned cycle. Subsequent HERZUMA maintenance doses should be administered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or once every three week schedules, respectively. If the patient has missed a dose of HERZUMA by more than one week, a re-loading dose of HERZUMA should be administered over approximately 90 minutes (weekly schedule: 4 mg/kg; once every three week schedule: 8 mg/kg) as soon as possible. Subsequent HERZUMA maintenance doses (weekly schedule: 2 mg/kg; once every three week schedule 6 mg/kg) should be administered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or once every three week schedules, respectively. 2.5 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Infusion Reactions [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Decrease the rate of infusion for mild or moderate infusion reactions Interrupt the infusion in patients with dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension Discontinue HERZUMA for severe or life-threatening infusion reactions. Cardiomyopathy [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of HERZUMA and at regular intervals during treatment. Withhold HERZUMA dosing for at least 4 weeks for either of the following: \u2265 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values LVEF below institutional limits of normal and \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. HERZUMA may be resumed if, within 4 to 8 weeks, the LVEF returns to normal limits and the absolute decrease from baseline is \u2264 15%. Permanently discontinue HERZUMA for a persistent (> 8 weeks) LVEF decline or for suspension of HERZUMA dosing on more than 3 occasions for cardiomyopathy. 2.6 Preparation Instructions To prevent medication errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the drug being prepared and administered is HERZUMA (trastuzumab-pkrb) and not ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. 420 mg Multiple-dose vial Reconstitution Reconstitute each 420 mg vial of HERZUMA with 20 mL of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection (BWFI), USP, containing 1.1% benzyl alcohol as a preservative to yield a multiple-dose solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-pkrb that delivers 20 mL (420 mg trastuzumab-pkrb). In patients with known hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol, reconstitute with 20 mL of Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) without preservative to yield a one-time use solution. Use appropriate aseptic technique when performing the following reconstitution steps: Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject the 20 mL of diluent into the vial containing the lyophilized powder of HERZUMA, which has a cake-like appearance. The stream of diluent should be directed into the cake. The reconstituted vial yields a solution for multiple-dose use, containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-pkrb. Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE. Slight foaming of the product may be present upon reconstitution. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect visually for particulates and discoloration. The solution should be free of visible particulates, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. Store reconstituted HERZUMA in the refrigerator at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F); discard unused HERZUMA after 28 days. If HERZUMA is reconstituted with SWFI without preservative, use immediately and discard any unused portion. Do not freeze. Dilution Determine the dose (mg) of HERZUMA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Calculate the volume of the 21 mg/mL reconstituted HERZUMA solution needed, withdraw this amount from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. DO NOT USE DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. The solution of HERZUMA for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, should be stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for no more than 24 hours prior to use. This storage time is additional to the time allowed for the reconstituted vials. Do not freeze. 150 mg Single-dose vial Reconstitution Reconstitute each 150 mg vial of HERZUMA with 7.4 mL of Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) (not supplied) to yield a single-dose solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-pkrb that delivers 7.15 mL (150 mg trastuzumab-pkrb). Use appropriate aseptic technique when performing the following reconstitution steps: Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 7.4 mL of SWFI (not supplied) into the vial containing the lyophilized powder of HERZUMA, which has a cake-like appearance. The stream of diluent should be directed into the cake. The reconstituted vial yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-pkrb. Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE. Slight foaming of the product may be present upon reconstitution. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect visually for particulates and discoloration. The solution should be free of visible particulates, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. Use the HERZUMA solution immediately following reconstitution with SWFI, as it contains no preservative and is intended for one-time use only. If not used immediately, store the reconstituted HERZUMA solution for up to 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F); discard any unused HERZUMA after 24 hours. Do not freeze. Dilution Determine the dose (mg) of HERZUMA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Calculate the volume of the 21 mg/mL reconstituted HERZUMA solution needed. Withdraw this amount from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. DO NOT USE DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. The solution of HERZUMA for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, should be stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for no more than 24 hours prior to use. Discard after 24 hours. This storage time is additional to the time allowed for the reconstituted vials. Do not freeze."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) 5.1 Cardiomyopathy Trastuzumab products can cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death [see Boxed Warning: Cardiomyopathy ]. Trastuzumab products can also cause asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). There is a 4 to 6 fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction among patients receiving trastuzumab products as a single agent or in combination therapy compared with those not receiving trastuzumab products. The highest absolute incidence occurs when a trastuzumab product is administered with an anthracycline. Withhold HERZUMA for \u2265 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values or an LVEF value below institutional limits of normal and \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab products in patients with trastuzumab product-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied. Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping trastuzumab products may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cardiac Monitoring Conduct thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan. The following schedule is recommended: Baseline LVEF measurement immediately prior to initiation of HERZUMA LVEF measurements every 3 months during and upon completion of HERZUMA Repeat LVEF measurement at 4 week intervals if HERZUMA is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] LVEF measurements every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of HERZUMA as a component of adjuvant therapy. In NSABP B31, 15% (158/1031) of patients discontinued trastuzumab due to clinical evidence of myocardial dysfunction or significant decline in LVEF after a median follow-up duration of 8.7 years in the AC-TH (anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab) arm. In HERA (one-year trastuzumab treatment), the number of patients who discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up was 2.6% (44/1678). In BCIRG006, a total of 2.9% (31/1056) of patients in the TCH (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab) arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 1.4% during the monotherapy phase) and 5.7% (61/1068) of patients in the AC-TH arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 4.2% during the monotherapy phase) discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity. Among 64 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831) who developed congestive heart failure, one patient died of cardiomyopathy, one patient died suddenly without documented etiology and 33 patients were receiving cardiac medication at last follow-up. Approximately 24% of the surviving patients had recovery to a normal LVEF (defined as \u2265 50%) and no symptoms on continuing medical management at the time of last follow-up. Incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) is presented in Table 1. The safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab products in patients with trastuzumab product-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied. Table 1: Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure in Adjuvant Breast Cancer Studies Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure % (n) Study Regimen Trastuzumab Control NSABP B31 & NCCTG N9831 Median follow-up duration for NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 combined was 8.3 years in the AC\u2192paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm. AC Anthracycline (doxorubicin) and cyclophosphamide. \u2192Paclitaxel+Trastuzumab 3.2% (64/2000) Includes 1 patient with fatal cardiomyopathy and 1 patient with sudden death without documented etiology. 1.3% (21/1655) HERA Includes NYHA II-IV and cardiac death at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up in the one-year trastuzumab arm.

In post-marketing reports, serious and fatal infusion reactions have been reported. Severe reactions, which include bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypoxia, and severe hypotension, were usually reported during or immediately following the initial infusion. However, the onset and clinical course were variable, including progressive worsening, initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration, or delayed post-infusion events with rapid clinical deterioration. For fatal events, death occurred within hours to days following a serious infusion reaction. Interrupt HERZUMA infusion in all patients experiencing dyspnea, clinically significant hypotension, and intervention of medical therapy administered (which may include epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, bronchodilators, and oxygen). Patients should be evaluated and carefully monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Permanent discontinuation should be strongly considered in all patients with severe infusion reactions. There are no data regarding the most appropriate method of identification of patients who may safely be retreated with trastuzumab products after experiencing a severe infusion reaction. Prior to resumption of trastuzumab infusion, the majority of patients who experienced a severe infusion reaction were pre-medicated with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. While some patients tolerated trastuzumab infusions, others had recurrent severe infusion reactions despite pre-medications. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of HERZUMA. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to HERZUMA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of HERZUMA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Trastuzumab product use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity. 5.5 Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] ."

The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving trastuzumab products in the adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer setting are fever, nausea, vomiting, infusion reactions, diarrhea, infections, increased cough, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, neutropenia, anemia, and myalgia. Adverse reactions requiring interruption or discontinuation of trastuzumab product treatment include CHF, significant decline in left ventricular cardiac function, severe infusion reactions, and pulmonary toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . In the metastatic gastric cancer setting, the most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) that were increased (\u2265 5% difference) in the trastuzumab arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. The most common adverse reactions which resulted in discontinuation of treatment on the trastuzumab-containing arm in the absence of disease progression were infection, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia. Adjuvant Breast Cancer The information below reflects exposure to one-year trastuzumab therapy across three randomized, open-label studies, NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, and HERA with (n = 3678) or without (n = 3363) trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. HERA Table 3 reflects exposure to trastuzumab in 1678 patients in HERA; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks and median number of infusions was 18 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Table 3: Adverse Reactions (> 1%) in HERA (All Grades) The incidence of Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions was < 1% in both arms for each listed term.

Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer with Trastuzumab Beyond One Year Extending adjuvant treatment beyond one year is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In HERA, a comparison of trastuzumab administered once every 3 weeks for two years versus one year was performed. The rate of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was increased in the 2-year trastuzumab compared to the 1-year trastuzumab treatment arm (8.1% versus 4.6%, respectively). More patients experienced at least one adverse reaction of Grade 3 or higher in the 2-year trastuzumab treatment arm (20.4%) compared with the one-year trastuzumab treatment arm (16.3%). NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 The safety data from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 were obtained from 3655 patients, of whom 2000 received trastuzumab; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In NSABP B31, only Grade 3 to 5 adverse events, treatment-related Grade 2 events, and Grade 2 to 5 dyspnea were collected during and for up to 3 months following protocol-specified treatment. The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2 to 5 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: fatigue (29.5% vs. 22.4%), infection (24.0% vs. 12.8%), hot flashes (17.1% vs. 15%), anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7%), dyspnea (11.8% vs. 4.6%), rash/desquamation (10.9% vs. 7.6%), leukopenia (10.5% vs. 8.4%), neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3%), headache (6.2% vs. 3.8%), pain (5.5% vs. 3%), edema (4.7% vs. 2.7%), and insomnia (4.3% vs. 1.5%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. In NCCTG N9831, data collection was limited to the following investigator-attributed treatment-related adverse reactions: NCI-CTC Grade 4 and 5 hematologic toxicities, Grade 3 to 5 non-hematologic toxicities, selected Grade 2 to 5 toxicities associated with taxanes (myalgia, arthralgias, nail changes, motor neuropathy, and sensory neuropathy) and Grade 1 to 5 cardiac toxicities occurring during chemotherapy and/or trastuzumab treatment. The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2 to 5 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: arthralgia (12.2% vs. 9.1%), nail changes (11.5% vs. 6.8%), dyspnea (2.4% vs. 0.2%), and diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. BCIRG006 Safety data from BCIRG006 reflect exposure to trastuzumab as part of an adjuvant treatment regimen from 2124 patients receiving at least one dose of study treatment [AC-TH: n = 1068; TCH: n = 1056]. The overall median treatment duration was 54 weeks in both the AC-TH and TCH arms. The median number of infusions was 26 in the AC-TH arm and 30 in the TCH arm, including weekly infusions during the chemotherapy phase and once every three week dosing in the monotherapy period [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In BCIRG006, the toxicity profile was similar to that reported in NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, and HERA with the exception of a lower incidence of CHF in the TCH arm. Metastatic Breast Cancer Studies The safety of trastuzumab was evaluated in one randomized, open-label study (H0648g) of chemotherapy with (n = 235) or without (n = 234) intravenous trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer and in one single-arm study (H0649g) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (n = 222) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients received 4 mg/kg initial dose of trastuzumab followed by 2 mg/kg weekly. In H0648g, 58% of patients received trastuzumab for \u2265 6 months and 9% received trastuzumab for \u2265 12 months, respectively. In H0649g, 31% of patients received trastuzumab for \u2265 6 months and 16% received trastuzumab for \u2265 12 months, respectively. Table 4 shows the adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) in patients from H0648g and H0649g. Table 4: Adverse Reactions Data for trastuzumab single agent were from 4 studies, including 213 patients from H0649g (\u2265 5%) in the Trastuzumab Arms in H0648g and H0649g Trastuzumab n = 352 % Trastuzumab + Paclitaxel n = 91 % Paclitaxel n = 95 % Trastuzumab + AC Anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) and cyclophosphamide. n = 143 % AC n = 135 % General Pain 47 61 62 57 42 Asthenia 42 62 57 54 55 Fever 36 49 23 56 34 Chills 32 41 4 35 11 Headache 26 36 28 44 31 Abdominal pain 22 34 22 23 18 Back pain 22 34 30 27 15 Infection 20 47 27 47 31 Flu syndrome 10 12 5 12 6 Accidental injury 6 13 3 9 4 Allergic reaction 3 8 2 4 2 Gastrointestinal Nausea 33 51 9 76 77 Diarrhea 25 45 29 45 26 Vomiting 23 37 28 53 49 Anorexia 14 24 16 31 26 Nausea and vomiting 8 14 11 18 9 Respiratory Cough increased 26 41 22 43 29 Dyspnea 22 27 26 42 25 Rhinitis 14 22 5 22 16 Pharyngitis 12 22 14 30 18 Sinusitis 9 21 7 13 6 Skin Rash 18 38 18 27 17 Herpes simplex 2 12 3 7 9 Acne 2 11 3 3 < 1 Nervous Insomnia 14 25 13 29 15 Dizziness 13 22 24 24 18 Paresthesia 9 48 39 17 11 Depression 6 12 13 20 12 Peripheral neuritis 2 23 16 2 2 Neuropathy 1 13 5 4 4 Metabolic Peripheral edema 10 22 20 20 17 Edema 8 10 8 11 5 Cardiovascular Congestive heart failure 7 11 1 28 7 Tachycardia 5 12 4 10 5 Musculoskeletal Bone pain 7 24 18 7 7 Arthralgia 6 37 21 8 9 Urogenital Urinary tract infection 5 18 14 13 7 Blood and Lymphatic Anemia 4 14 9 36 26 Leukopenia 3 24 17 52 34 Metastatic Gastric Cancer The safety of trastuzumab was evaluated in patients with previously untreated for metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in an open label, multi-center trial (ToGA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (FC+H) (n=294) or chemotherapy alone (FC) (n=290). Patients in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm received trastuzumab 8 mg/kg administered on Day 1 (prior to chemotherapy) followed by 6 mg/kg every 21 days until disease progression. Cisplatin was administered at 80 mg/m 2 on Day 1 and the fluoropyrimidine was administered as either capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 orally twice a day on Days 1 to 14 or 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m 2 /day as a continuous intravenous infusion Days 1 through 5. Chemotherapy was administered for six 21 day cycles. Median duration of trastuzumab treatment was 21 weeks and the median number of trastuzumab infusions administered was eight. Table 5: Adverse Reactions (All Grades \u2265 5% or Grade 3-4 \u2265 1% between Arms) in ToGA Adverse Reactions Trastuzumab + FC (N = 294) % FC (N = 290) % All Grades Grades 3-4 All Grades Grades 3-4 Investigations Neutropenia 78 34 73 29 Hypokalemia 28 10 24 6 Anemia 28 12 21 10 Thrombocytopenia 16 5 11 3 Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Febrile Neutropenia \u2014 5 \u2014 3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Diarrhea 37 9 28 4 Stomatitis 24 1 15 2 Dysphagia 6 2 3 < 1 General Fatigue 35 4 28 2 Fever 18 1 12 0 Mucosal Inflammation 13 2 6 1 Chills 8 < 1 0 0 Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Weight Decrease 23 2 14 2 Infections and Infestations Upper Respiratory Tract Infections 19 0 10 0 Nasopharyngitis 13 0 6 0 Renal and Urinary Disorders Renal Failure and Impairment 18 3 15 2 Nervous System Disorders Dysgeusia 10 0 5 0 The following subsections provide additional detail regarding adverse reactions observed in clinical trials of adjuvant breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer, metastatic gastric cancer, or post-marketing experience. Cardiomyopathy Serial measurement of cardiac function (LVEF) was obtained in clinical trials in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. In HERA, the median duration of follow-up was 12.6 months (12.4 months in the observation arm; 12.6 months in the 1-year trastuzumab arm); and in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, 7.9 years in the AC-T arm, 8.3 years in the AC-TH arm. Following initiation of trastuzumab therapy, the incidence of new-onset dose-limiting myocardial dysfunction was higher among patients receiving trastuzumab and paclitaxel as compared to those receiving paclitaxel alone in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and in patients receiving one-year trastuzumab monotherapy compared to observation in HERA (see Table 6 , Figures 1 and 2 ). The incidence of new-onset cardiac dysfunction, as measured by LVEF, remained similar when compared to the analysis performed at a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC-TH arm. This analysis showed evidence of reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction, with 64.5% of patients who experienced symptomatic CHF in the AC-TH group being asymptomatic at latest follow-up, and 90.3% having full or partial LVEF recovery. Table 6: Myocardial Dysfunction (by LVEF) in NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, HERA and BCIRG006 For NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831 and HERA, events are counted from the beginning of trastuzumab treatment. For BCIRG006, events are counted from the date of randomization.

Figure 2: HERA: Cumulative Incidence of Time to First LVEF Decline of \u2265 10 Percentage Points from Baseline and to Below 50% with Death as a Competing Risk Event Time 0 is the date of randomization. Figure 3: BCIRG006: Cumulative Incidence of Time to First LVEF Decline of \u2265 10 Percentage Points from Baseline and to Below 50% with Death as a Competing Risk Event Time 0 is the date of randomization. The incidence of congestive heart failure among patients in the metastatic breast cancer trials was classified for severity using the New York Heart Association classification system (I to IV, where IV is the most severe level of cardiac failure) (see Table 2 ). In the metastatic breast cancer trials, the probability of cardiac dysfunction was highest in patients who received trastuzumab concurrently with anthracyclines. In ToGA, 5% of patients in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm compared to 1.1% of patients in the chemotherapy alone arm had LVEF value below 50% with a \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Infusion Reactions During the first infusion with trastuzumab, the symptoms most commonly reported were chills and fever, occurring in approximately 40% of patients in clinical trials. Symptoms were treated with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and meperidine (with or without reduction in the rate of trastuzumab infusion); permanent discontinuation of trastuzumab for infusion reactions was required in < 1% of patients. Other signs and/or symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), rigors, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, elevated blood pressure, rash, and asthenia. Infusion reactions occurred in 21% and 35% of patients, and were severe in 1.4% and 9% of patients, on second or subsequent trastuzumab infusions administered as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, respectively. In the post-marketing setting, severe infusion reactions, including hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and angioedema have been reported. Anemia In randomized controlled clinical trials, the overall incidence of anemia (30% vs. 21% [H0648g]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2\u20135 anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7% [NSABP B31]), and of anemia requiring transfusions (0.1% vs. 0 patients [NCCTG N9831]) were increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Following the administration of trastuzumab as a single agent (H0649g), the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 anemia was < 1%. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer), on the trastuzumab containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the overall incidence of anemia was 28% compared to 21% and of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 anemia was 12.2% compared to 10.3%. Neutropenia In randomized controlled clinical trials in the adjuvant setting, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 4 to 5 neutropenia (1.7% vs. 0.8% [NCCTG N9831]) and of selected Grade 2 to 5 neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3% [NSABP B31]) were increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. In a randomized, controlled trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia (32% vs. 22%) and of febrile neutropenia (23% vs. 17%) were also increased in patients randomized to trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer) on the trastuzumab containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 36.8% compared to 28.9%; febrile neutropenia 5.1% compared to 2.8%. Infection The overall incidences of infection (46% vs. 30% [H0648g]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 infection/febrile neutropenia (24.3% vs. 13.4% [NSABP B31]) and of selected Grade 3 to 5 infection/febrile neutropenia (2.9% vs. 1.4% [NCCTG N9831]) were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. The most common site of infections in the adjuvant setting involved the upper respiratory tract, skin, and urinary tract. In BCIRG006, the overall incidence of infection was higher with the addition of trastuzumab to AC-T but not to TCH [44% (AC-TH), 37% (TCH), 38% (AC-T)]. The incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 infection were similar [25% (AC-TH), 21% (TCH), 23% (AC-T)] across the three arms. In a randomized, controlled trial in treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the reported incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher (23% vs. 17%) in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. Pulmonary Toxicity Adjuvant Breast Cancer Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 pulmonary toxicity (14.3% vs. 5.4% [NSABP B31]) and of selected NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 5 pulmonary toxicity and spontaneous reported Grade 2 dyspnea (3.4% vs. 0.9% [NCCTG N9831]) was higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. The most common pulmonary toxicity was dyspnea (NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5: 11.8% vs. 4.6% [NSABP B31]; NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5: 2.4% vs. 0.2% [NCCTG N9831]). Pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving trastuzumab compared with 0.3% of those receiving chemotherapy alone. Fatal respiratory failure occurred in 3 patients receiving trastuzumab, one as a component of multi-organ system failure, as compared to 1 patient receiving chemotherapy alone. In HERA, there were 4 cases of interstitial pneumonitis in the one-year trastuzumab treatment arm compared to none in the observation arm at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months. Metastatic Breast Cancer Among women receiving trastuzumab for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the incidence of pulmonary toxicity was also increased. Pulmonary adverse events have been reported in the post-marketing experience as part of the symptom complex of infusion reactions. Pulmonary events include bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. For a detailed description, see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) . Thrombosis/Embolism In 4 randomized, controlled clinical trials, the incidence of thrombotic adverse events was higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in three studies (2.6% vs. 1.5% [NSABP B31], 2.5% and 3.7% vs. 2.2% [BCIRG006] and 2.1% vs. 0% [H0648g]). Diarrhea Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 2\u20135 diarrhea (6.7% vs. 5.4% [NSABP B31]) and of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 5 diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0% [NCCTG N9831]), and of Grade 1 to 4 diarrhea (7% vs. 1% [HERA; one-year trastuzumab treatment at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up]) were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab as compared to controls. In BCIRG006, the incidence of Grade 3 to 4 diarrhea was higher [5.7% AC-TH, 5.5% TCH vs. 3.0% AC-T] and of Grade 1 to 4 was higher [51% AC-TH, 63% TCH vs. 43% AC-T] among women receiving trastuzumab. Of patients receiving trastuzumab as a single agent for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, 25% experienced diarrhea. An increased incidence of diarrhea was observed in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Renal Toxicity In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer) on the trastuzumab-containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm the incidence of renal impairment was 18% compared to 14.5%. Severe (Grade 3/4) renal failure was 2.7% on the trastuzumab-containing arm compared to 1.7% on the chemotherapy only arm. Treatment discontinuation for renal insufficiency/failure was 2% on the trastuzumab-containing arm and 0.3% on the chemotherapy only arm. In the post-marketing setting, rare cases of nephrotic syndrome with pathologic evidence of glomerulopathy have been reported. The time to onset ranged from 4 months to approximately 18 months from initiation of trastuzumab therapy. Pathologic findings included membranous glomerulonephritis, focal glomerulosclerosis, and fibrillary glomerulonephritis. Complications included volume overload and congestive heart failure. 6. 2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of trastuzumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infusion reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Oligohydramnios or oligohydramnios sequence, including pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Glomerulopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Immune thrombocytopenia Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Cases of possible TLS have been reported in patients treated with trastuzumab products. Patients with significant tumor burden (e.g. bulky metastases) may be at a higher risk. Patients could present with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS. Providers should consider additional monitoring and/or treatment as clinically indicated."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Verify the pregnancy status of females prior to initiation of HERZUMA. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Data ]. Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if a trastuzumab product is used in a pregnant woman or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of a trastuzumab product [see Clinical Considerations ]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received HERZUMA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal/neonatal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. Data Human Data In post-m arketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence. Fetal manifestations included pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received trastuzumab either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In most reported cases, amniotic fluid index increased after trastuzumab was stopped. In reported cases where trastuzumab therapy was resumed after amniotic index improved, oligohydramnios recurred. Animal Data In studies where trastuzumab was administered to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (up to 25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early (Gestation Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation. The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of trastuzumab products in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Published data suggest human IgG is present in human milk but does not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts. Trastuzumab was present in the milk of lactating Cynomolgus monkeys but not associated with neonatal toxicity [see Data ]. Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's clinical need for HERZUMA treatment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from HERZUMA or from the underlying maternal condition. This consideration should also take into account the trastuzumab product wash out period of 7 months [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Data In lactating Cynomolgus monkeys, trastuzumab was present in breast milk at about 0.3% of maternal serum concentrations after pre- (beginning Gestation Day 120) and post-partum (through Post-partum Day 28) doses of 25 mg/kg administered twice weekly (25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg of trastuzumab products). Infant monkeys with detectable serum levels of trastuzumab did not exhibit any adverse effects on growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of HERZUMA. Contraception Females Trastuzumab products can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with HERZUMA and for 7 months following the last dose of HERZUMA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of HERZUMA in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Trastuzumab has been administered to 386 patients who were 65 years of age or over (253 in the adjuvant treatment and 133 in metastatic breast cancer treatment settings). The risk of cardiac dysfunction was increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger patients in both those receiving treatment for metastatic disease in H0648g and H0649g, or adjuvant therapy in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831. Limitations in data collection and differences in study design of the 4 studies of trastuzumab in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer preclude a determination of whether the toxicity profile of trastuzumab in older patients is different from younger patients. The reported clinical experience is not adequate to determine whether the efficacy improvements (ORR, TTP, OS, DFS) of trastuzumab treatment in older patients is different from that observed in patients < 65 years of age for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer), of the 294 patients treated with trastuzumab, 108 (37%) were 65 years of age or older, while 13 (4.4%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Trastuzumab-pkrb is a humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein, HER2. Trastuzumab-pkrb is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture. HERZUMA (trastuzumab-pkrb) for injection is a sterile, white to pale yellow, preservative-free lyophilized powder with a cake-like appearance, for intravenous administration. Each multiple-dose vial of HERZUMA delivers 420 mg trastuzumab-pkrb, 839 mg \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose dihydrate, 9.5 mg L-histidine HCl, 6.1 mg L-histidine, and 1.7 mg polysorbate 20. Reconstitution with 20 mL of the appropriate diluent (BWFI or SWFI) yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-pkrb that delivers 20 mL (420 mg trastuzumab-pkrb), at a pH of approximately 6. If HERZUMA is reconstituted with SWFI without preservative, the reconstituted solution is considered single-dose. Each single-dose vial of HERZUMA delivers 150 mg trastuzumab-pkrb, 299.6 mg \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose dihydrate, 3.4 mg L-histidine HCl, 2.2 mg L-histidine, and 0.6 mg polysorbate 20. Reconstitution with 7.4 mL of sterile water for injection (SWFI) yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-pkrb that delivers 7.15 mL (150 mg trastuzumab-pkrb), at a pH of approximately 6."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Trastuzumab products have been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Trastuzumab products are mediators of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro , trastuzumab product-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Trastuzumab product exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic responses are not fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effects of trastuzumab on electrocardiographic (ECG) endpoints, including QTc interval duration, were evaluated in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. Trastuzumab had no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval duration and there was no apparent relationship between serum trastuzumab concentrations and change in QTcF interval duration in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab were evaluated in a pooled population pharmacokinetic (PK) model analysis of 1,582 subjects with primarily breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) receiving intravenous trastuzumab. Total trastuzumab clearance increases with decreasing concentrations due to parallel linear and non-linear elimination pathways. Although the average trastuzumab exposure was higher following the first cycle in breast cancer patients receiving the once every three week schedule compared to the weekly schedule of trastuzumab, the average steady-state exposure was essentially the same at both dosages. The average trastuzumab exposure following the first cycle and at steady state as well as the time to steady state was higher in breast cancer patients compared to MGC patients at the same dosage; however, the reason for this exposure difference is unknown. Additional predicted trastuzumab exposure and PK parameters following the first trastuzumab cycle and at steady state exposure are described in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. Population PK based simulations indicate that following discontinuation of trastuzumab, concentrations in at least 95% of breast cancer patients and MGC patients will decrease to approximately 3% of the population predicted steady-state trough serum concentration (approximately 97% washout) by 7 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] .

The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab products in patients with severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease with or without hemodialysis, or hepatic impairment is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies There have been no formal drug interaction studies performed with trastuzumab products in humans. Clinically significant interactions between trastuzumab and concomitant medications used in clinical trials have not been observed. Paclitaxel and doxorubicin: Concentrations of paclitaxel and doxorubicin and their major metabolites (i.e., 6-\u03b1 hydroxyl-paclitaxel [POH], and doxorubicinol [DOL], respectively) were not altered in the presence of trastuzumab when used as combination therapy in clinical trials. Trastuzumab concentrations were not altered as part of this combination therapy. Docetaxel and carboplatin: When trastuzumab was administered in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin, neither the plasma concentrations of docetaxel or carboplatin nor the plasma concentrations of trastuzumab were altered. Cisplatin and capecitabine: In a drug interaction substudy conducted in patients in ToGA, the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin, capecitabine and their metabolites were not altered when administered in combination with trastuzumab. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of trastuzumab or of other trastuzumab products. Among 903 women with metastatic breast cancer, human anti human antibody (HAHA) to trastuzumab was detected in one patient using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This patient did not experience an allergic reaction. Samples for assessment of HAHA were not collected in studies of adjuvant breast cancer. The clinical relevance of the development of anti-trastuzumab antibodies after treatment with trastuzumab is not known."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Trastuzumab products have been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Trastuzumab products are mediators of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro , trastuzumab product-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab were evaluated in a pooled population pharmacokinetic (PK) model analysis of 1,582 subjects with primarily breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) receiving intravenous trastuzumab. Total trastuzumab clearance increases with decreasing concentrations due to parallel linear and non-linear elimination pathways. Although the average trastuzumab exposure was higher following the first cycle in breast cancer patients receiving the once every three week schedule compared to the weekly schedule of trastuzumab, the average steady-state exposure was essentially the same at both dosages. The average trastuzumab exposure following the first cycle and at steady state as well as the time to steady state was higher in breast cancer patients compared to MGC patients at the same dosage; however, the reason for this exposure difference is unknown. Additional predicted trastuzumab exposure and PK parameters following the first trastuzumab cycle and at steady state exposure are described in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. Population PK based simulations indicate that following discontinuation of trastuzumab, concentrations in at least 95% of breast cancer patients and MGC patients will decrease to approximately 3% of the population predicted steady-state trough serum concentration (approximately 97% washout) by 7 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] .

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adjuvant Breast Cancer The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab in women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2 overexpressing breast cancer were evaluated in an integrated analysis of two randomized, open-label, clinical trials (NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831) with a total of 4063 women at the protocol-specified final overall survival analysis, a third randomized, open-label, clinical trial (HERA) with a total of 3386 women at definitive Disease-Free Survival analysis for one-year trastuzumab treatment versus observation, and a fourth randomized, open-label clinical trial with a total of 3222 patients (BCIRG006). NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 In NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by IHC) or gene amplification (by FISH). HER2 testing was verified by a central laboratory prior to randomization (NCCTG N9831) or was required to be performed at a reference laboratory (NSABP B31). Patients with a history of active cardiac disease based on symptoms, abnormal electrocardiographic, radiologic, or left ventricular ejection fraction findings or uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic > 100 mm Hg or systolic > 200 mm Hg) were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (AC\u2192paclitaxel) alone or paclitaxel plus trastuzumab (AC\u2192paclitaxel + trastuzumab). In both trials, patients received four 21-day cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 . Paclitaxel was administered either weekly (80 mg/m 2 ) or every 3 weeks (175 mg/m 2 ) for a total of 12 weeks in NSABP B31; paclitaxel was administered only by the weekly schedule in NCCTG N9831. Trastuzumab was administered at 4 mg/kg on the day of initiation of paclitaxel and then at a dose of 2 mg/kg weekly for a total of 52 weeks. Trastuzumab treatment was permanently discontinued in patients who developed congestive heart failure, or persistent/recurrent LVEF decline [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after the completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure of the combined efficacy analysis was Disease-Free Survival (DFS), defined as the time from randomization to recurrence, occurrence of contralateral breast cancer, other second primary cancer, or death. An additional efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). A total of 3752 patients were included in the joint efficacy analysis of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC\u2192paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm. The pre-planned final OS analysis from the joint analysis included 4063 patients and was performed when 707 deaths had occurred after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC\u2192paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm. The data from both arms in NSABP B31 and two of the three study arms in NCCTG N9831 were pooled for efficacy analyses. The patients included in the DFS analysis had a median age of 49 years (range, 22 to 80 years; 6% > 65 years), 84% were White, 7% Black, 4% Hispanic, and 4% Asian/Pacific Islander. Disease characteristics included 90% infiltrating ductal histology, 38% T1, 91% nodal involvement, 27% intermediate and 66% high grade pathology, and 53% ER+ and/or PR+ tumors. HERA In HERA, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by IHC) or gene amplification (by FISH) as determined at a central laboratory. Patients with node-negative disease were required to have \u2265 T1c primary tumor. Patients with a history of congestive heart failure or LVEF < 55%, uncontrolled arrhythmias, angina requiring medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, poorly controlled hypertension (systolic > 180 mm Hg or diastolic > 100 mm Hg) were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) upon completion of definitive surgery, and at least four cycles of chemotherapy to receive no additional treatment, or one year of trastuzumab treatment or two years of trastuzumab treatment. Patients undergoing a lumpectomy had also completed standard radiotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ disease received systemic adjuvant hormonal therapy at investigator discretion. Trastuzumab was administered with an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg once every three weeks. The major efficacy outcome measure was Disease-Free Survival (DFS), defined as in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831. HERA was designed to compare one and two years of once every three week trastuzumab treatment versus observation in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery, established chemotherapy and radiotherapy (if applicable). A protocol specified interim efficacy analysis comparing one-year trastuzumab treatment to observation was performed at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months in the trastuzumab arm. Among the 3386 patients randomized to the observation (n = 1693) and trastuzumab one year (n = 1693) treatment arms, the median age was 49 years (range 21 to 80), 83% were White, and 13% were Asian. Disease characteristics: 94% infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 50% ER+ and/or PgR+, 57% node positive, 32% node negative, and in 11% of patients, nodal status was not assessable due to prior neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Ninety-six percent (1055/1098) of patients with node-negative disease had high-risk features: among the 1098 patients with node-negative disease, 49% (543) were ER- and PgR-, and 47% (512) were ER and/or PgR + and had at least one of the following high-risk features: pathological tumor size greater than 2 cm, Grade 2 to 3, or age < 35 years. Prior to randomization, 94% of patients had received anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. After the DFS results comparing observation to one-year trastuzumab treatment were disclosed, a prospectively planned analysis that included comparison of one year versus two years of trastuzumab treatment at a median follow-up duration of 8 years was performed. Based on this analysis, extending trastuzumab treatment for a duration of two years did not show additional benefit over treatment for one year [Hazard Ratios of two-years trastuzumab versus one-year trastuzumab treatment in the intent to treat (ITT) population for Disease-Free Survival (DFS) = 0.99 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.13), p-value = 0.90 and Overall Survival (OS) = 0.98 (0.83, 1.15); p-value = 0.78]. BCIRG006 In BCIRG006, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 gene amplification (FISH+ only) as determined at a central laboratory. Patients were required to have either node-positive disease, or node-negative disease with at least one of the following high-risk features: ER/PR-negative, tumor size > 2 cm, age < 35 years, or histologic and/or nuclear Grade 2 or 3. Patients with a history of CHF, myocardial infarction, Grade 3 or 4 cardiac arrhythmia, angina requiring medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease, poorly controlled hypertension (diastolic > 100 mm Hg), any T4 or N2, or known N3 or M1 breast cancer were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (AC-T), doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel plus trastuzumab (AC-TH), or docetaxel and carboplatin plus trastuzumab (TCH). In both the AC-T and AC-TH arms, doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 were administered every 3 weeks for four cycles; docetaxel 100 mg/m 2 was administered every 3 weeks for four cycles. In the TCH arm, docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 and carboplatin (at a target AUC of 6 mg/mL/min as a 30- to 60-minute infusion) were administered every 3 weeks for six cycles. Trastuzumab was administered weekly (initial dose of 4 mg/kg followed by weekly dose of 2 mg/kg) concurrently with either T or TC, and then every 3 weeks (6 mg/kg) as monotherapy for a total of 52 weeks. Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. Disease-Free Survival (DFS) was the major efficacy outcome measure. Among 3222 patients, the median age was 49 (range 22 to 74 years; 6% \u2265 65 years). Disease characteristics included 54% ER+ and/or PR+ and 71% node positive. Prior to randomization, all patients underwent primary surgery for breast cancer. The results for DFS for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, HERA, and BCIRG006 and OS results for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and HERA are presented in Table 9. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the duration of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC\u2192TH arm is presented in Figure 4, and the duration of OS after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC\u2192TH arm is presented in Figure 5. The duration of DFS for BCIRG006 is presented in Figure 6. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the OS hazard ratio was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.74). At 8.3 years of median follow up [AC\u2192TH], the survival rate was estimated to be 86.9% in the AC\u2192TH arm and 79.4% in the AC\u2192T arm. The final OS analysis results from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 indicate that OS benefit by age, hormone receptor status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size and grade, and surgery/radiation therapy was consistent with the treatment effect in the overall population. In patients \u2264 50 years of age (n = 2197), the OS hazard ratio was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81) and in patients > 50 years of age (n = 1866), the OS hazard ratio was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (ER-positive and/or PR-positive) (n = 2223), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (ER-negative and PR-negative) (n = 1830), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.80). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size \u2264 2 cm (n = 1604), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.71). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size > 2 cm (n = 2448), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.80).

The results are shown in Table 10. The number of events in NCCTG N9831 was small with the exception of the IHC 3+/FISH+ subgroup, which constituted 81% of those with data. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding efficacy within other subgroups due to the small number of events. The number of events in HERA was adequate to demonstrate significant effects on DFS in the IHC 3+/FISH unknown and the FISH+/IHC unknown subgroups.

Both trials studied patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein. Patients were eligible if they had 2 or 3 levels of overexpression (based on a 0 to 3 scale) by immunohistochemical assessment of tumor tissue performed by a central testing lab. Previously Untreated Metastatic Breast Cancer (H0648g) H0648g was a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted in 469 women with metastatic breast cancer who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Tumor specimens were tested by IHC (Clinical Trial Assay, CTA) and scored as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+, with 3+ indicating the strongest positivity. Only patients with 2+ or 3+ positive tumors were eligible (about 33% of those screened). Patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or in combination with trastuzumab given intravenously as a 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by weekly doses of trastuzumab at 2 mg/kg. For those who had received prior anthracycline therapy in the adjuvant setting, chemotherapy consisted of paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 over 3 hours every 21 days for at least six cycles); for all other patients, chemotherapy consisted of anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC: doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 or epirubicin 75 mg/m 2 plus 600 mg/m 2 cyclophosphamide every 21 days for six cycles). Sixty-five percent of patients randomized to receive chemotherapy alone in this study received trastuzumab at the time of disease progression as part of a separate extension study. Based upon the determination by an independent Response Evaluation Committee, the patients randomized to trastuzumab and chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer median time to disease progression (TTP), a higher overall response rate (ORR), and a longer median duration of response (DoR), as compared with patients randomized to chemotherapy alone. Patients randomized to trastuzumab and chemotherapy also had a longer median overall survival (OS) (see Table 11 ). These treatment effects were observed both in patients who received trastuzumab plus paclitaxel and in those who received trastuzumab plus AC; however, the magnitude of the effects was greater in the paclitaxel subgroup.

Of 222 patients enrolled, 66% had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy, 68% had received two prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease, and 25% had received prior myeloablative treatment with hematopoietic rescue. Patients were treated with a loading dose of 4 mg/kg IV followed by weekly doses of trastuzumab at 2 mg/kg IV. The ORR (complete response + partial response), as determined by an independent Response Evaluation Committee, was 14%, with a 2% complete response rate and a 12% partial response rate. Complete responses were observed only in patients with disease limited to skin and lymph nodes. The overall response rate in patients whose tumors tested as CTA 3+ was 18% while in those that tested as CTA 2+, it was 6%. 14.3 Metastatic Gastric Cancer The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil) were studied in patients previously untreated for metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (ToGA). In this open-label, multi-center trial, 594 patients were randomized 1:1 to trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (FC+H) or chemotherapy alone (FC). Randomization was stratified by extent of disease (metastatic vs. locally advanced), primary site (gastric vs. gastroesophageal junction), tumor measurability (yes vs. no), ECOG performance status (0, 1 vs. 2), and fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine vs. 5-fluorouracil). All patients were either HER2 gene amplified (FISH+) or HER2 overexpressing (IHC 3+). Patients were also required to have adequate cardiac function (e.g., LVEF > 50%). On the trastuzumab-containing arm, trastuzumab was administered as an IV infusion at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression. On both study arms, cisplatin was administered at a dose of 80 mg/m 2 Day 1 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles as a 2 hour IV infusion. On both study arms, capecitabine was administered at 1000 mg/m 2 dose orally twice daily (total daily dose 2000 mg/m 2 ) for 14 days of each 21 day cycle for 6 cycles. Alternatively, continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) 5-fluorouracil was administered at a dose of 800 mg/m 2 /day from Day 1 through Day 5 every three weeks for 6 cycles. The median age of the study population was 60 years (range: 21 to 83); 76% were male; 53% were Asian, 38% Caucasian, 5% Hispanic, 5% other racial/ethnic groups; 91% had ECOG PS of 0 or 1; 82% had primary gastric cancer and 18% had primary gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Of these patients, 23% had undergone prior gastrectomy, 7% had received prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy, and 2% had received prior radiotherapy. The main outcome measure of ToGA was overall survival (OS), analyzed by the unstratified log-rank test. The final OS analysis based on 351 deaths was statistically significant (nominal significance level of 0.0193). An updated OS analysis was conducted at one year after the final analysis. The efficacy results of both the final and the updated analyses are summarized in Table 13 and Figure 7.

( 1.1 , 1.2 ) The treatment of HER2-overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. ( 1.3 ) Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for a trastuzumab product ( 1 , 2.2 ). 1.1 Adjuvant Breast Cancer Ogivri is indicated in adults for adjuvant treatment of HER2 overexpressing node positive or node negative (ER/PR negative or with one high risk feature [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] ) breast cancer as part of a treatment regimen consisting of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and either paclitaxel or docetaxel as part of a treatment regimen with docetaxel and carboplatin as a single agent following multi-modality anthracycline based therapy. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for a trastuzumab product [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 1.2 Metastatic Breast Cancer Ogivri is indicated in adults: In combination with paclitaxel for first-line treatment of HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer As a single agent for treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer in patients who have received one or more chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for a trastuzumab product [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 1.3 Metastatic Gastric Cancer Ogivri is indicated in adults, in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil, for the treatment of patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have not received prior treatment for metastatic disease. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for a trastuzumab product [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous (IV) infusion only. Do not administer as an IV push or bolus. Ogivri has different dosage and administration instructions than subcutaneous trastuzumab products. ( 2.3 ) Do not substitute Ogivri (trastuzumab-dkst) for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. ( 2.3 ) Perform HER2 testing using FDA-approved tests by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. ( 1 , 2.2 ) Adjuvant Treatment of HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer ( 2.2 ) Administer at either: Initial dose of 4 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion, then 2 mg/kg over 30 minutes IV infusion weekly for 12 weeks (with paclitaxel or docetaxel) or 18 weeks (with docetaxel and carboplatin). One week after the last weekly dose of Ogivri, administer 6 mg/kg as an IV infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks to complete a total of 52 weeks of therapy, or Initial dose of 8 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion, then 6 mg/kg over 30 to 90 minutes IV infusion every three weeks for 52 weeks. Metastatic HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer ( 2.3 ) Initial dose of 4 mg/kg as a 90 minutes IV infusion followed by subsequent weekly doses of 2 mg/kg as 30 minutes IV infusions. Metastatic HER2-Overexpressing Gastric Cancer ( 2.3 ) Initial dose of 8 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion, followed by 6 mg/kg over 30 to 90 minutes IV infusion every 3 weeks. 2.1 Evaluation and Testing Before Initiating Ogivri Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of Ogivri and at regular intervals during treatment. [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Ogivri [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]. 2.2 Patient Selection Select patients based on HER2 protein overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in tumor specimens [see Indications and Usage (1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . Assessment of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification should be performed using FDA-approved tests specific for breast or gastric cancers by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. Information on the FDA-approved tests for the detection of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. Assessment of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification in metastatic gastric cancer should be performed using FDA-approved tests specifically for gastric cancers due to differences in gastric vs. breast histopathology, including incomplete membrane staining and more frequent heterogeneous expression of HER2 seen in gastric cancers. Improper assay performance, including use of suboptimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents, deviation from specific assay instructions, and failure to include appropriate controls for assay validation, can lead to unreliable results. 2.3 Recommended Dosage Ogivri is for intravenous infusion only. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. Ogivri has different dosage and administration instructions than subcutaneous trastuzumab products. Do not mix Ogivri with other drugs. Do not substitute Ogivri (trastuzumab-dkst) for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer: Administer according to one of the following doses and schedules for a total of 52 weeks of Ogivri therapy: During and following paclitaxel, docetaxel, or docetaxel and carboplatin: Initial dose of 4 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes then at 2 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes weekly during chemotherapy for the first 12 weeks (paclitaxel or docetaxel) or 18 weeks (docetaxel and carboplatin). One week following the last weekly dose of Ogivri, administer Ogivri at 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks. As a single agent within three weeks following completion of multi-modality, anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens: Initial dose at 8 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes Subsequent doses at 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks. Extending adjuvant treatment beyond one year is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Metastatic Breast Cancer: Administer Ogivri, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, at an initial dose of 4 mg/kg as a 90-minute intravenous infusion followed by subsequent once weekly doses of 2 mg/kg as 30-minute intravenous infusions until disease progression. Metastatic Gastric Cancer: Administer Ogivri at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg as a 90 minute intravenous infusion followed by subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks until disease progression . 2.4 Important Dosing Considerations Missed Dose If the patient has missed a dose of Ogivri by one week or less, then the usual maintenance dose (weekly schedule: 2 mg/kg; once every three weeks schedule: 6 mg/kg) should be administered as soon as possible. Do not wait until the next planned cycle. Subsequent Ogivri maintenance doses should be administered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or once every three week schedules, respectively. If the patient has missed a dose of Ogivri by more than one week, a re-loading dose of Ogivri should be administered over approximately 90 minutes (weekly schedule: 4 mg/kg; once every three week schedule: 8 mg/kg) as soon as possible. Subsequent Ogivri maintenance doses (weekly schedule: 2 mg/kg; three-weekly schedule 6 mg/kg) should be administered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or once every three week schedules, respectively. 2.5 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Infusion Reactions [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Decrease the rate of infusion for mild or moderate infusion reactions Interrupt the infusion in patients with dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension Discontinue Ogivri for severe or life-threatening infusion reactions. Cardiomyopathy [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of Ogivri and at regular intervals during treatment. Withhold Ogivri dosing for at least 4 weeks for either of the following: \u226516% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values LVEF below institutional limits of normal and \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. Ogivri may be resumed if, within 4 to 8 weeks, the LVEF returns to normal limits and the absolute decrease from baseline is \u226415%. Permanently discontinue Ogivri for a persistent (>8 weeks) LVEF decline or for suspension of Ogivri dosing on more than 3 occasions for cardiomyopathy. 2.6 Preparation Instructions To prevent medication errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the drug being prepared and administered is Ogivri (trastuzumab-dkst) and not ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam- trastuzumab deruxtecan. 420 mg Multiple-dose vial supplied with a separate vial containing 20 mL of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP, to be used as diluent. 420 mg Multiple-dose vial drug only carton. No diluent is provided. Reconstitution: Reconstitute each 420 mg vial of Ogivri with 20 mL of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (BWFI), containing 0.9% to 1.1% benzyl alcohol (not supplied for the 420 mg multiple-dose vial drug only carton) as a preservative to yield a multiple-dose solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-dkst that delivers 20 mL (420 mg trastuzumab-dkst). In patients with known hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol, reconstitute with 20 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP (SWFI) without preservative to yield a one-time use solution. Use appropriate aseptic technique when performing the following reconstitution steps: Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject the 20 mL of diluent into the vial containing the lyophilized powder of Ogivri, which has a cake-like appearance. The stream of diluent should be directed into the lyophilized cake. The reconstituted vial yields a solution for multiple-dose use, containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-dkst. Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE. Slight foaming of the product may be present upon reconstitution. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect visually for particulates and discoloration. The solution should be free of visible particulates, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. Store reconstituted Ogivri in the refrigerator at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) ; discard unused Ogivri after 28 days. If Ogivri is reconstituted with SWFI without preservative, use immediately and discard any unused portion. Do not freeze. Dilution: Determine the dose (mg) of Ogivri [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Calculate the volume of the 21 mg/mL reconstituted Ogivri solution needed. Withdraw this amount from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. DO NOT USE DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. The solution of Ogivri for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, should be stored at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) for no more than 24 hours prior to use. This storage time is additional to the time allowed for the reconstituted vials. Do not freeze. 150 mg Single-dose vial Reconstitution: Reconstitute each 150 mg vial of Ogivri with 7.4 mL of Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) (not supplied) to yield a single-dose solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-dkst that delivers 7.15 mL (150 mg trastuzumab-dkst). Use appropriate aseptic technique when performing the following reconstitution steps: Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 7.4 mL of SWFI (not supplied) into the vial containing the lyophilized powder of Ogivri, which has a cake-like appearance. The stream of diluent should be directed into the cake. The reconstituted vial yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-dkst. Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE. Slight foaming of the product may be present upon reconstitution. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect visually for particulates and discoloration. The solution should be free of visible particulates, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. Use the Ogivri solution immediately following reconstitution with SWFI, as it contains no preservative and is intended for one-time use only. If not used immediately, store the reconstituted Ogivri solution for up to 24 hours at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) ; discard any unused Ogivri after 24 hours. Do not freeze. Dilution: Determine the dose (mg) of Ogivri [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Calculate the volume of the 21 mg/mL reconstituted Ogivri solution needed Withdraw this amount from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. DO NOT USE DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. The solution of Ogivri for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, should be stored at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) for no more than 24 hours prior to use.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) 5.1 Cardiomyopathy Trastuzumab products can cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death [see Boxed Warning: Cardiomyopathy ] . Trastuzumab products can also cause asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). There is a 4 to 6 fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction among patients receiving trastuzumab products as a single agent or in combination therapy compared with those not receiving trastuzumab products. The highest absolute incidence occurs when a trastuzumab product is administered with an anthracycline. Withhold Ogivri for \u2265 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values or an LVEF value below institutional limits of normal and \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab products in patients with trastuzumab product-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied. Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping trastuzumab products may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Cardiac Monitoring Conduct thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan. The following schedule is recommended: Baseline LVEF measurement immediately prior to initiation of Ogivri LVEF measurements every 3 months during and upon completion of Ogivri Repeat LVEF measurement at 4 week intervals if Ogivri is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] LVEF measurements every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of Ogivri as a component of adjuvant therapy. In NSABP B31, 15% (158/1031) of patients discontinued trastuzumab due to clinical evidence of myocardial dysfunction or significant decline in LVEF after a median follow-up duration of 8.7 years in the AC-TH (anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab) arm. In HERA (one-year trastuzumab treatment), the number of patients who discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up was 2.6% (44/1678). In BCIRG006, a total of 2.9% (31/1056) of patients in the TCH (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab) arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 1.4% during the monotherapy phase) and 5.7% (61/1068) of patients in the AC-TH arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 4.2% during the monotherapy phase) discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity. Among 64 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831) who developed congestive heart failure, one patient died of cardiomyopathy, one patient died suddenly without documented etiology and 33 patients were receiving cardiac medication at last follow-up. Approximately 24% of the surviving patients had recovery to a normal LVEF (defined as \u2265 50%) and no symptoms on continuing medical management at the time of last follow-up. Incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) is presented in Table 1. The safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab products in patients with trastuzumab product-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied.

In HERA (one-year trastuzumab treatment), at a median follow-up duration of 8 years, the incidence of severe CHF (NYHA III & IV) was 0.8%, and the rate of mild symptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction was 4.6%.

In BCIRG006, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 cardiac ischemia/infarction was higher in the trastuzumab containing regimens (AC-TH: 0.3% (3/1068) and TCH: 0.2% (2/1056)) as compared to none in AC-T. 5.2 Infusion Reactions Infusion reactions consist of a symptom complex characterized by fever and chills, and on occasion included nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, rash, and asthenia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In post-marketing reports, serious and fatal infusion reactions have been reported. Severe reactions, which include bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypoxia, and severe hypotension, were usually reported during or immediately following the initial infusion. However, the onset and clinical course were variable, including progressive worsening, initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration, or delayed post-infusion events with rapid clinical deterioration. For fatal events, death occurred within hours to days following a serious infusion reaction. Interrupt Ogivri infusion in all patients experiencing dyspnea, clinically significant hypotension, and intervention of medical therapy administered (which may include epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, bronchodilators, and oxygen). Patients should be evaluated and carefully monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Permanent discontinuation should be strongly considered in all patients with severe infusion reactions. There are no data regarding the most appropriate method of identification of patients who may safely be retreated with trastuzumab products after experiencing a severe infusion reaction. Prior to resumption of trastuzumab infusion, the majority of patients who experienced a severe infusion reaction were pre-medicated with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. While some patients tolerated trastuzumab infusions, others had recurrent severe infusion reactions despite pre-medications. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Ogivri. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to Ogivri during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of Ogivri [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Trastuzumab product use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity. 5.5 Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] ."

( 6.1 ) Metastatic Breast Cancer \u2022 Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) are fever, chills, headache, infection, congestive heart failure, insomnia, cough, and rash. ( 6.1 ) Metastatic Gastric Cancer \u2022 Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) are neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biocon Biologics at 1-833-986-1468 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving trastuzumab products in the adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer setting are fever, nausea, vomiting, infusion reactions, diarrhea, infections, increased cough, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, neutropenia, anemia, and myalgia. Adverse reactions requiring interruption or discontinuation of trastuzumab product treatment include CHF, significant decline in left ventricular cardiac function, severe infusion reactions, and pulmonary toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . In the metastatic gastric cancer setting, the most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) that were increased (\u2265 5% difference) in the trastuzumab arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. The most common adverse reactions which resulted in discontinuation of treatment on the trastuzumab-containing arm in the absence of disease progression were infection, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia. Adjuvant Breast Cancer The information below reflects exposure to one-year trastuzumab therapy across three randomized, open-label studies, NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, and HERA, with (n = 3678) or without (n = 3363) trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. HERA Table 3 reflects exposure to trastuzumab in 1678 patients in HERA; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks and median number of infusions was 18 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Table 3: Adverse Reactions ( > 1%) in HERA (All Grades) a Adverse Reactions Trastuzumab (n = 1678) % Observation (n = 1708) % Nervous System Headache 10 3 Paresthesia 2 0.6 Musculoskeletal Arthralgia 8 6 Back pain 5 3 Myalgia 4 1 Bone pain 3 2 Muscle spasm 3 0.2 Infections Nasopharyngitis 8 3 Urinary tract infection 3 0.8 Gastrointestinal Diarrhea 7 1 Nausea 6 1 Vomiting 3.5 0.6 Constipation 2 1 Dyspepsia 2 0.5 Upper abdominal pain 2 1 General Pyrexia 6 0.4 Peripheral edema 5 2 Chills 5 0 Asthenia 4.5 2 Influenza-like illness 2 0.2 Respiratory Thoracic Mediastinal Cough 5 2 Influenza 4 0.5 Dyspnea 3 2 URI 3 1 Rhinitis 2 0.4 Pharyngolaryngeal pain 2 0.5 Sinusitis 2 0.3 Epistaxis 2 0.06 Cardiac Hypertension 4 2 Dizziness 4 2 Ejection fraction decreased 3.5 0.6 Palpitations 3 0.7 Cardiac arrhythmias b 3 1 Cardiac failure (congestive) 2 0.3 Skin & Subcutaneous Tissue Rash 4 0.6 Nail disorders 2 0 Pruritus 2 0.6 a The incidence of Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions was < 1% in both arms for each listed term. b Higher level grouping term. Clinically relevant adverse reactions in < 1% of patients who received trastuzumab in HERA included hypersensitivity (0.6%), cardiac failure (0.5%), cardiac disorder (0.3%), interstitial pneumonitis (0.2%), pulmonary hypertension (0.2%), ventricular disorder (0.2%), autoimmune thyroiditis (0.3%), and sudden death (0.06%). Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer with Trastuzumab Beyond One Year Extending adjuvant treatment beyond one year is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . In HERA, a comparison of trastuzumab administered once every 3 weeks for two years versus one year was performed. The rate of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was increased in the 2-year trastuzumab compared to the 1-year trastuzumab treatment arm (8.1% versus 4.6%, respectively). More patients experienced at least one adverse reaction of Grade 3 or higher in the 2-year trastuzumab treatment arm (20.4%) compared with the one-year trastuzumab treatment arm (16.3%). NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 The safety data from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 were obtained from 3655 patients, of whom 2000 received trastuzumab; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In NSABP B31, only Grade 3 to 5 adverse events, treatment-related Grade 2 events, and Grade 2 to 5 dyspnea were collected during and for up to 3 months following protocol-specified treatment. The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2 to 5 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: fatigue (29.5% vs. 22.4%), infection (24.0% vs. 12.8%), hot flashes (17.1% vs. 15%), anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7%), dyspnea (11.8% vs. 4.6%), rash/desquamation (10.9% vs. 7.6%), leukopenia (10.5% vs. 8.4%), neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3%), headache (6.2% vs. 3.8%), pain (5.5% vs. 3%), edema (4.7% vs. 2.7%) and insomnia (4.3% vs. 1.5%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. In NCCTG N9831, data collection was limited to the following investigator-attributed treatment-related adverse reactions: NCI-CTC Grade 4 and 5 hematologic toxicities, Grade 3 to 5 non-hematologic toxicities, selected Grade 2 to 5 toxicities associated with taxanes (myalgia, arthralgias, nail changes, motor neuropathy, and sensory neuropathy) and Grade 1 to 5 cardiac toxicities occurring during chemotherapy and/or trastuzumab treatment. The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2 to 5 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: arthralgia (12.2% vs. 9.1%), nail changes (11.5% vs.6.8%), dyspnea (2.4% vs. 0.2%), and diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. BCIRG006 Safety data from BCIRG006reflect exposure to trastuzumab as part of an adjuvant treatment regiimen from 2124 patients receiving at least one dose of study treatment [AC-TH: n = 1068; TCH: n = 1056]. The overall median treatment duration was 54 weeks in both the AC-TH and TCH arms. The median number of infusions was 26 in the AC-TH arm and 30 in the TCH arm, including weekly infusions during the chemotherapy phase and once every three week dosing in the monotherapy period [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In BCIRG006, the toxicity profile was similar to that reported in NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, and HERA with the exception of a lower incidence of CHF in the TCH arm. Metastatic Breast Cancer Studies The safety of trastuzumab was evaluated in one randomized, open-label study (H0648g) of chemotherapy with (n = 235) or without (n = 234) intravenous trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer and in one single-arm study (H0649g); in patients with metastatic breast cancer (n=222) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Patients received 4 mg/kg initial dose of trastuzumab followed by 2 mg/kg weekly. In H0648g, 58% of patients received trastuzumab for \u2265 6 months and 9% received trastuzumab \u2265 12 months, respectively. In H0649g, 31% of patients received trastuzumab for \u2265 6 months and 16% received trastuzumab for \u2265 12 months, respectively. Table 4 shows the adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) in patients from H0648g and H0649g.

Metastatic Gastric Cancer The safety of trastuzumab was evaluated in patients with previously untreated for metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in an open label, multi-center trial (ToGA) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (FC+H) (n=294) or chemotherapy alone (FC) (n=290) Patients in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm received trastuzumab 8 mg/kg administered on Day 1 (prior to chemotherapy) followed by 6 mg/kg every 21 days until disease progression. Cisplatin was administered at 80 mg/m 2 on Day 1 and the fluoropyrimidine was administered as either capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 orally twice a day on Days 1 to 14 or 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m 2 /day as a continuous intravenous infusion Days 1 through 5. Chemotherapy was administered for six 21-day cycles. Median duration of trastuzumab treatment was 21 weeks and the median number of trastuzumab infusions administered was eight.

Cardiomyopathy Serial measurement of cardiac function (LVEF) was obtained in clinical trials in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. In HERA, the median duration of follow-up was 12.6 months (12.4 months in the observation arm; 12.6 months in the 1-year trastuzumab arm); and in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, 7.9 years in the AC-T arm, 8.3 years in the AC-TH arm. Following initiation of trastuzumab therapy, the incidence of new-onset dose-limiting myocardial dysfunction was higher among patients receiving trastuzumab and paclitaxel as compared to those receiving paclitaxel alone in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and in patients receiving one-year trastuzumab monotherapy compared to observation in HERA (see Table 6, Figures 1 and 2). The incidence of new-onset cardiac dysfunction, as measured by LVEF, remained similar when compared to the analysis performed at a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC-TH arm. This analysis showed evidence of reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction, with 64.5% of patients who experienced symptomatic CHF in the AC-TH group being asymptomatic at latest follow-up, and 90.3% having full or partial LVEF recovery.

Figure 3 BCIRG006: Cumulative Incidence of Time to First LVEF Decline of \u2265 10 Percentage Points from Baseline and to Below 50% with Death as a Competing Risk Event Time 0 is the date of randomization. The incidence of congestive heart failure among patients in the metastatic breast cancer trials was classified for severity using the New York Heart Association classification system (I\u2212IV, where IV is the most severe level of cardiac failure) (see Table 2). In the metastatic breast cancer trials, the probability of cardiac dysfunction was highest in patients who received trastuzumab concurrently with anthracyclines. In ToGA, 5% of patients in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm compared to 1.1% of patients in the chemotherapy alone arm had LVEF value below 50% with a \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. Infusion Reactions During the first infusion with trastuzumab, the symptoms most commonly reported were chills and fever, occurring in approximately 40% of patients in clinical trials. Symptoms were treated with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and meperidine (with or without reduction in the rate of trastuzumab infusion); permanent discontinuation of trastuzumab for infusion reactions was required in < 1% of patients. Other signs and/or symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), rigors, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, elevated blood pressure, rash, and asthenia. Infusion reactions occurred in 21% and 35% of patients, and were severe in 1.4% and 9% of patients, on second or subsequent trastuzumab infusions administered as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, respectively. In the post-marketing setting, severe infusion reactions, including hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and angioedema have been reported. Anemia In randomized controlled clinical trials, the overall incidence of anemia (30% vs. 21% [H0648g]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7% [NSABP B31]), and of anemia requiring transfusions (0.1% vs. 0 patients [NCCTG N9831]) were increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Following the administration of trastuzumab as a single agent (H0649g), the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 anemia was < 1%. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer), on the trastuzumab containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the overall incidence of anemia was 28% compared to 21% and of NCI\u00adCTC Grade 3/4 anemia was 12.2% compared to 10.3%. Neutropenia In randomized controlled clinical trials in the adjuvant setting, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 4 to 5 neutropenia (1.7% vs. 0.8% [NCCTG N9831]) and of selected Grade 2 to 5 neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3% [NSABP B31]) were increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. In a randomized, controlled trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia (32% vs. 22%) and of febrile neutropenia (23% vs. 17%) were also increased in patients randomized to trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer) on the trastuzumab containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 36.8% compared to 28.9%; febrile neutropenia 5.1% compared to 2.8%. Infection The overall incidences of infection (46% vs. 30% [H0648g]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 infection/febrile neutropenia (24.3% vs. 13.4% [NSABP B31]) and of selected Grade 3 to 5 infection/febrile neutropenia (2.9% vs. 1.4%) [NCCTG N9831]) were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. The most common site of infections in the adjuvant setting involved the upper respiratory tract, skin, and urinary tract. In BCIRG006, the overall incidence of infection was higher with the addition of trastuzumab to AC-T but not to TCH [44% (AC-TH), 37% (TCH), 38% (AC-T)]. The incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 infection were similar [25% (AC-TH), 21% (TCH), 23% (AC-T)] across the three arms. In a randomized, controlled trial in treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the reported incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher (23% vs. 17%) in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. Pulmonary Toxicity Adjuvant Breast Cancer Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 pulmonary toxicity (14.3% vs. 5.4% [NSABP B31]) and of selected NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 5 pulmonary toxicity and spontaneous reported Grade 2 dyspnea (3.4 % vs. 0.9% [NCCTG N9831]) was higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. The most common pulmonary toxicity was dyspnea (NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5: 11.8% vs. 4.6% [NSABP B31]; NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5: 2.4% vs. 0.2% [NCCTG N9831]). Pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving trastuzumab compared with 0.3% of those receiving chemotherapy alone. Fatal respiratory failure occurred in 3 patients receiving trastuzumab, one as a component of multi-organ system failure, as compared to 1 patient receiving chemotherapy alone. In HERA, there were 4 cases of interstitial pneumonitis in the one-year trastuzumab treatment arm compared to none in the observation arm at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months. Metastatic Breast Cancer Among women receiving trastuzumab for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the incidence of pulmonary toxicity was also increased. Pulmonary adverse events have been reported in the post-marketing experience as part of the symptom complex of infusion reactions. Pulmonary events include bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. For a detailed description, see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) . Thrombosis/Embolism In 4 randomized, controlled clinical trials, the incidence of thrombotic adverse events was higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in three studies (2.6% vs. 1.5% [NSABP B31], 2.5% and 3.7% vs. 2.2% [BCIRG006] and 2.1% vs. 0% [H0648g]). Diarrhea Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 diarrhea (6.7% vs. 5.4% [NSABP B31]) and of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 5 diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0% [NCCTG N9831]), and of Grade 1 to 4 diarrhea (7% vs. 1% [HERA; one-year trastuzumab treatment at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up]) were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab as compared to controls. In BCIRG006, the incidence of Grade 3 to 4 diarrhea was higher [5.7% AC-TH, 5.5% TCH vs. 3.0% AC-T] and of Grade 1 to 4 was higher [51% AC-TH, 63% TCH vs. 43% AC-T] among women receiving trastuzumab. Of patients receiving trastuzumab as a single agent for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, 25% experienced diarrhea. An increased incidence of diarrhea was observed in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Renal Toxicity In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer) on the trastuzumab-containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm the incidence of renal impairment was 18% compared to 14.5%. Severe (Grade 3/4) renal failure was 2.7% on the trastuzumab-containing arm compared to 1.7% on the chemotherapy only arm. Treatment discontinuation for renal insufficiency/failure was 2% on the trastuzumab-containing arm and 0.3% on the chemotherapy only arm. In the post-marketing setting, rare cases of nephrotic syndrome with pathologic evidence of glomerulopathy have been reported. The time to onset ranged from 4 months to approximately 18 months from initiation of trastuzumab therapy. Pathologic findings included membranous glomerulonephritis, focal glomerulosclerosis, and fibrillary glomerulonephritis. Complications included volume overload and congestive heart failure. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of trastuzumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infusion reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Oligohydramnios or oligohydramnios sequence, including pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Glomerulopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Immune thrombocytopenia Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Cases of possible TLS have been reported in patients treated with trastuzumab products. Patients with significant tumor burden (e.g. bulky metastases) may be at a higher risk. Patients could present with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS. Providers should consider additional monitoring and/or treatment as clinically indicated."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Verify the pregnancy status of females prior to initiation of Ogivri ( 8.3 ). *Biosimilar means that the biological product is approved based on data demonstrating that it is highly similar to an FDA-approved biological product, known as a reference product, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product. Biosimilarity of Ogivri has been demonstrated for the condition(s) of use (e.g. indication(s), dosing regimen(s)), strength(s), dosage form(s), and route(s) of administration described in its Full Prescribing Information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Data ] . Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if a trastuzumab product is used in a pregnant woman or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of a trastuzumab product [see Clinical Considerations ] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received Ogivri during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal/neonatal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. Data Human Data In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence. Fetal manifestations includedpulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities and neonatal death. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received trastuzumab either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In most reported cases, amniotic fluid index increased after trastuzumab was stopped. In reported cases where trastuzumab therapy was resumed after amniotic index improved, oligohydramnios recurred. Animal Data In studies where trastuzumab was administered to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (up to 25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early (Gestation Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation. The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of trastuzumab products in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Published data suggest human IgG is present in human milk but does not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts. Trastuzumab was present in the milk of lactating Cynomolgus monkeys but not associated with neonatal toxicity (see Data ) . Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Ogivri treatment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Ogivri or from the underlying maternal condition. This consideration should also take into account the trastuzumab product wash out period of 7 months [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Data In lactating Cynomolgus monkeys, trastuzumab was present in breast milk at about 0.3% of maternal serum concentrations after pre-(beginning Gestation Day 120) and post-partum (through Post-partum Day 28) doses of 25 mg/kg administered twice weekly (25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg of trastuzumab products). Infant monkeys with detectable serum levels of trastuzumab did not exhibit any adverse effects on growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Ogivri. Contraception Females Trastuzumab products can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Ogivri and for 7 months following the last dose of Ogivri [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Ogivri in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Trastuzumab has been administered to 386 patients who were 65 years of age or over (253 in the adjuvant treatment and 133 in metastatic breast cancer treatment settings).

In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Data ] . Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if a trastuzumab product is used in a pregnant woman or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of a trastuzumab product [see Clinical Considerations ] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received Ogivri during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal/neonatal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. Data Human Data In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence. Fetal manifestations includedpulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities and neonatal death. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received trastuzumab either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In most reported cases, amniotic fluid index increased after trastuzumab was stopped. In reported cases where trastuzumab therapy was resumed after amniotic index improved, oligohydramnios recurred. Animal Data In studies where trastuzumab was administered to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (up to 25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early (Gestation Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation. The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Trastuzumab-dkst is a humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein, HER2. Trastuzumab-dkst is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture. Ogivri (trastuzumab-dkst) for injection is a sterile, off-white to pale yellow, preservative-free lyophilized powder with a cake-like appearance, for injection, for intravenous administration. Each multiple-dose vial of Ogivri delivers 420 mg trastuzumab-dkst, D-sorbitol (322.6 mg), L-Histidine (6.0 mg), Histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (9.4 mg) and Polyethylene glycol 3350/Macrogol 3350 (94.1 mg). Hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be used to adjust the pH of the formulation buffer. Reconstitution with 20 mL of the appropriate diluent (BWFI or SWFI) yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-dkst that delivers 20 mL (420 mg trastuzumab-dkst), at a pH of approximately 6. If Ogivri is reconstituted with SWFI without preservative, the reconstituted solution is considered single-dose. Each single-dose vial of Ogivri delivers 150 mg trastuzumab-dkst, D-sorbitol (115.2 mg), L-Histidine (2.16 mg), L-Histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (3.36 mg) and Polyethylene glycol 3350/Macrogol 3350 (33.6 mg). Hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be used to adjust the pH of the formulation buffer. Reconstitution with 7.4 mL of sterile water for injection (SWFI) yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-dkst that delivers 7.15 mL (150 mg trastuzumab-dkst), at a pH of approximately 6."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Trastuzumab products have been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Trastuzumab products are mediators of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro , trastuzumab product-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Trastuzumab product exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic responses are not fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effects of trastuzumab on electrocardiographic (ECG) endpoints, including QTc interval duration, were evaluated in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. Trastuzumab had no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval duration and there was no apparent relationship between serum trastuzumab concentrations and change in QTcF interval duration in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab were evaluated in a pooled population pharmacokinetic (PK) model analysis of 1,582 subjects with primarily breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) receiving intravenous trastuzumab. Total trastuzumab clearance increases with decreasing concentrations due to parallel linear and non-linear elimination pathways. Although the average trastuzumab exposure was higher following the first cycle in breast cancer patients receiving the once every three week schedule compared to the weekly schedule of trastuzumab, the average steady-state exposure was essentially the same at both dosages. The average trastuzumab exposure following the first cycle and at steady state as well as the time to steady state was higher in breast cancer patients compared to MGC patients at the same dosage; however, the reason for this exposure difference is unknown. Additional predicted trastuzumab exposure and PK parameters following the first trastuzumab cycle and at steady state exposure are described in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. Population PK based simulations indicate that following discontinuation of trastuzumab, concentrations in at least 95% of breast cancer patients and MGC patients will decrease to approximately 3% of the population predicted steady-state trough serum concentration (approximately 97% washout) by 7 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] .

The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab products in patients with severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease with or without hemodialysis, or hepatic impairment is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies There have been no formal drug interaction studies performed with trastuzumab products in humans. Clinically significant interactions between trastuzumab and concomitant medications used in clinical trials have not been observed. Paclitaxel and doxorubicin: Concentrations of paclitaxel and doxorubicin and their major metabolites (i.e., 6-\u03b1 hydroxyl-paclitaxel [POH], and doxorubicinol [DOL], respectively) were not altered in the presence of trastuzumab when used as combination therapy in clinical trials. Trastuzumab concentrations were not altered as part of this combination therapy. Docetaxel and carboplatin: When trastuzumab was administered in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin, neither the plasma concentrations of docetaxel or carboplatin nor the plasma concentrations of trastuzumab were altered. Cisplatin and capecitabine: In a drug interaction substudy conducted in patients in ToGA, the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin, capecitabine and their metabolites were not altered when administered in combination with trastuzumab. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of trastuzumab or of other trastuzumab products. Among 903 women with metastatic breast cancer, human anti human antibody (HAHA) to trastuzumab was detected in one patient using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This patient did not experience an allergic reaction. Samples for assessment of HAHA were not collected in studies of adjuvant breast cancer. The clinical relevance of the development of anti-trastuzumab antibodies after treatment with trastuzumab is not known."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adjuvant Breast Cancer The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab in women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2 overexpressing breast cancer were evaluated in an integrated analysis of two randomized, open-label, clinical trials (Studies NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831) with a total of 4063 women at the protocol-specified final overall survival analysis, a third randomized, open-label, clinical trial (HERA) with a total of 3386 women at definitive Disease-Free Survival analysis for one-year trastuzumab treatment versus observation, and a fourth randomized, open-label clinical trial with a total of 3222 patients (BCIRG006). NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 In NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by IHC) or gene amplification (by FISH). HER2 testing was verified by a central laboratory prior to randomization (NCCTG N9831) or was required to be performed at a reference laboratory (NSABP B31). Patients with a history of active cardiac disease based on symptoms, abnormal electrocardiographic, radiologic, or left ventricular ejection fraction findings or uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic > 100 mm Hg or systolic > 200 mm Hg) were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (AC \u2192 paclitaxel) alone or paclitaxel plus trastuzumab (AC \u2192 paclitaxel + trastuzumab). In both trials, patients received four 21-day cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 . Paclitaxel was administered either weekly (80 mg/m 2 ) or every 3 weeks (175 mg/m 2 ) for a total of 12 weeks in NSABP B31; paclitaxel was administered only by the weekly schedule in NCCTG N9831. Trastuzumab was administered at 4 mg/kg on the day of initiation of paclitaxel and then at a dose of 2 mg/kg weekly for a total of 52 weeks. Trastuzumab treatment was permanently discontinued in patients who developed congestive heart failure, or persistent/recurrent LVEF decline [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after the completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure of the combined efficacy analysis was Disease-Free Survival (DFS), defined as the time from randomization to recurrence, occurrence of contralateral breast cancer, other second primary cancer, or death. An additional efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). A total of 3752 patients were included in the joint efficacy analysis of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC \u2192 paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm. The pre-planned final OS analysis from the joint analysis included 4063 patients and was performed when 707 deaths had occurred after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC \u2192 paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm. The data from both arms in NSABP B31 and two of the three study arms in NCCTG N9831 were pooled for efficacy analyses. The patients included in the DFS analysis had a median age of 49 years (range, 22 to 80 years; 6% > 65 years), 84% were white, 7% black, 4% Hispanic, and 4% Asian/Pacific Islander. Disease characteristics included 90% infiltrating ductal histology, 38% T1, 91% nodal involvement, 27% intermediate and 66% high grade pathology, and 53% ER+ and/or PR+ tumors. HERA In HERA, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by IHC) or gene amplification (by FISH) as determined at a central laboratory. Patients with node-negative disease were required to have \u2265 T1c primary tumor. Patients with a history of congestive heart failure or LVEF < 55%, uncontrolled arrhythmias, angina requiring medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, poorly controlled hypertension (systolic > 180 mm Hg or diastolic > 100 mm Hg) were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) upon completion of definitive surgery, and at least four cycles of chemotherapy to receive no additional treatment, or one year of trastuzumab treatment or two years of trastuzumab treatment. Patients undergoing a lumpectomy had also completed standard radiotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ disease received systemic adjuvant hormonal therapy at investigator discretion. Trastuzumab was administered with an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg once every three weeks. The major efficacy outcome measure was Disease-Free Survival (DFS), defined as in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831. HERA was designed to compare one and two years of once every three week trastuzumab treatment versus observation in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery, established chemotherapy and radiotherapy (if applicable). A protocol specified interim efficacy analysis comparing one-year trastuzumab treatment to observation was performed at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months in the trastuzumab arm. Among the 3386 patients randomized to the observation (n = 1693) and trastuzumab one-year (n = 1693) treatment arms, the median age was 49 years (range 21 to 80), 83% were White, and 13% were Asian. Disease characteristics: 94% infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 50% ER+ and/or PgR+, 57% node positive, 32% node negative, and in 11% of patients, nodal status was not assessable due to prior neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Ninety-six percent (1055/1098) of patients with node-negative disease had high-risk features: among the 1098 patients with node-negative disease, 49% (543) were ER\u2212 and PgR\u2212, and 47% (512) were ER and/or PgR + and had at least one of the following high-risk features: pathological tumor size greater than 2 cm, Grade 2 to 3, or age <35 years. Prior to randomization, 94% of patients had received anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. After the DFS results comparing observation to one-year trastuzumab treatment were disclosed, a prospectively planned analysis that included comparison of one year versus two years of trastuzumab treatment at a median follow-up duration of 8 years was performed. Based on this analysis, extending trastuzumab treatment for a duration of two years did not show additional benefit over treatment for one year [Hazard Ratios of two-years trastuzumab versus one-year trastuzumab treatment in the intent to treat (ITT) population for Disease-Free Survival (DFS) = 0.99 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.13), p-value = 0.90 and Overall Survival (OS) = 0.98 (0.83, 1.15); p-value = 0.78]. BCIRG006 In BCIRG006, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 gene amplification (FISH+ only) as determined at a central laboratory. Patients were required to have either node-positive disease, or node-negative disease with at least one of the following high-risk features: ER/PR-negative, tumor size > 2 cm, age < 35 years, or histologic and/or nuclear Grade 2 or 3. Patients with a history of CHF, myocardial infarction, Grade 3 or 4 cardiac arrhythmia, angina requiring medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease, poorly controlled hypertension (diastolic > 100 mm Hg), any T4 or N2 or known N3 or M1 breast cancer were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (AC-T), doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel plus trastuzumab (AC-TH), or docetaxel and carboplatin plus trastuzumab (TCH). In both the AC-T and AC-TH arms, doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 were administered every 3 weeks for four cycles; docetaxel 100 mg/m 2 was administered every 3 weeks for four cycles. In the TCH arm, docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 and carboplatin (at a target AUC of 6 mg/mL/min as a 30-to 60-minute infusion) were administered every 3 weeks for six cycles. Trastuzumab was administered weekly (initial dose of 4 mg/kg followed by weekly dose of 2 mg/kg) concurrently with either T or TC, and then every 3 weeks (6 mg/kg) as monotherapy for a total of 52 weeks. Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. Disease-Free Survival (DFS) was the major efficacy outcome measure. Among 3222 patients, the median age was 49 (range 22 to 74 years; 6% \u2265 65 years). Disease characteristics included 54% ER+ and/or PR+ and 71% node positive. Prior to randomization, all patients underwent primary surgery for breast cancer. The results for DFS for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, HERA, and BCIRG006 and OS results for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and HERA are presented in Table 9. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the duration of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC \u2192 TH arm is presented in Figure 4, and the duration of OS after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC \u2192 TH arm is presented in Figure 5. The duration of DFS for BCIRG006is presented in Figure 6. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the OS hazard ratio was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.74). At 8.3 years of median follow-up [AC \u2192 TH], the survival rate was estimated to be 86.9% in the AC \u2192 TH arm and 79.4% in the AC \u2192 T arm. The final OS analysis results from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 indicate that OS benefit by age, hormone receptor status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size and grade, and surgery/radiation therapy was consistent with the treatment effect in the overall population. In patients \u2264 50 years of age (n = 2197), the OS hazard ratio was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81) and in patients > 50 years of age (n = 1866), the OS hazard ratio was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (ER-positive and/or PR-positive) (n = 2223), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (ER-negative and PR-negative) (n = 1830), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.80). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size \u2264 2 cm (n = 1604), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.71). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size > 2 cm (n = 2448), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.80).

The results are shown in Table 10. The number of events in NCCTG N9831 was small with the exception of the IHC 3+/FISH+ subgroup, which constituted 81% of those with data. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding efficacy within other subgroups due to the small number of events. The number of events in HERA was adequate to demonstrate significant effects on DFS in the IHC 3+/FISH unknown and the FISH +/IHC unknown subgroups.

Both trials studied patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein. Patients were eligible if they had 2 or 3 levels of overexpression (based on a 0 to 3 scale) by immunohistochemical assessment of tumor tissue performed by a central testing lab. Previously Untreated Metastatic Breast Cancer (H0648g) H0648g was a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted in 469 women with metastatic breast cancer who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Tumor specimens were tested by IHC (Clinical Trial Assay, CTA) and scored as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+, with 3+ indicating the strongest positivity. Only patients with 2+ or 3+ positive tumors were eligible (about 33% of those screened). Patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or in combination with trastuzumab given intravenously as a 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by weekly doses of trastuzumab at 2 mg/kg. For those who had received prior anthracycline therapy in the adjuvant setting, chemotherapy consisted of paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 over 3 hours every 21 days for at least six cycles); for all other patients, chemotherapy consisted of anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC: doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 or epirubicin 75 mg/m 2 plus 600 mg/m 2 cyclophosphamide every 21 days for six cycles). Sixty-five percent of patients randomized to receive chemotherapy alone in this study received trastuzumab at the time of disease progression as part of a separate extension study. Based upon the determination by an independent Response Evaluation Committee the patients randomized to trastuzumab and chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer median time to disease progression (TTP), a higher overall response rate (ORR), and a longer median duration of response (DoR), as compared with patients randomized to chemotherapy alone. Patients randomized to trastuzumab and chemotherapy also had a longer median overall survival (OS) (see Table 11). These treatment effects were observed both in patients who received trastuzumab plus paclitaxel and in those who received trastuzumab plus AC; however the magnitude of the effects was greater in the paclitaxel subgroup.

Previously Treated Metastatic Breast Cancer (H0649g) Trastuzumab was studied as a single agent in a multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical trial (H0649g) in patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had relapsed following one or two prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. Of 222 patients enrolled, 66% had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy, 68% had received two prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease, and 25% had received prior myeloablative treatment with hematopoietic rescue. Patients were treated with a loading dose of 4 mg/kg IV followed by weekly doses of trastuzumab at 2 mg/kg IV. The ORR (complete response + partial response), as determined by an independent Response Evaluation Committee, was 14%, with a 2% complete response rate and a 12% partial response rate. Complete responses were observed only in patients with disease limited to skin and lymph nodes. The overall response rate in patients whose tumors tested as CTA 3+ was 18% while in those that tested as CTA 2+, it was 6%. 14.3 Metastatic Gastric Cancer The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil) were studied in patients previously untreated for metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (ToGA). In this open-label, multi-center trial, 594 patients were randomized 1:1 to trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (FC+H) or chemotherapy alone (FC). Randomization was stratified by extent of disease (metastatic vs. locally advanced), primary site (gastric vs. gastroesophageal junction), tumor measurability (yes vs. no), ECOG performance status (0,1 vs. 2), and fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine vs. 5-fluorouracil). All patients were either HER2 gene amplified (FISH+) or HER2 overexpressing (IHC 3+). Patients were also required to have adequate cardiac function (e.g., LVEF > 50%). On the trastuzumab-containing arm, trastuzumab was administered as an IV infusion at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression. On both study arms cisplatin was administered at a dose of 80 mg/m 2 Day 1 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles as a 2 hour IV infusion. On both study arms capecitabine was administered at 1000 mg/m 2 dose orally twice daily (total daily dose 2000 mg/m 2 ) for 14 days of each 21 day cycle for 6 cycles. Alternatively, continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) 5-fluorouracil was administered at a dose of 800 mg/m 2 /day from Day 1 through Day 5 every three weeks for 6 cycles. The median age of the study population was 60 years (range: 21 to 83); 76% were male; 53% were Asian, 38% Caucasian, 5% Hispanic, 5% other racial/ethnic groups; 91% had ECOG PS of 0 or 1; 82% had primary gastric cancer and 18% had primary gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Of these patients, 23% had undergone prior gastrectomy, 7% had received prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy, and 2% had received prior radiotherapy. The main outcome measure of ToGA was overall survival (OS), analyzed by the unstratified log\u00adrank test. The final OS analysis based on 351 deaths was statistically significant (nominal significance level of 0.0193). An updated OS analysis was conducted at one year after the final analysis. The efficacy results of both the final and the updated analyses are summarized in Table 13 and Figure 7. Table 13: Overall Survival in ToGA (ITT Population) FC a + Trastuzumab Arm N = 298 FC a Arm N = 296 Overall Survival (interim analysis) N (%) Median (months) 95% CI 167 (56.0%) 13.5 (11.7, 15.7) 184 (62.2%) 11.0 (9.4, 12.5) Hazard Ratio 95% CI p-value b 0.73 (0.60, 0.91) 0.0038 Overall Survival (updated) N (%) Median (months) 95% CI 221 (74.2%) 13.1 (11.9, 15.1) 227 (76.7%) 11.7 (10.3, 13.0) Hazard Ratio 95% CI 0.80 (0.67, 0.97) a FC = capecitabine vs. 5-fluorouracil b Two sided p-value comparing with the nominal significance level of 0.0193.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous (IV) infusion only. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. TRAZIMERA has different dosage and administration instructions than subcutaneous trastuzumab products. ( 2.3 ) Do not substitute TRAZIMERA (trastuzumab-qyyp) for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. ( 2.3 ) Perform HER2 testing using FDA-approved tests by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. ( 1 , 2.2 ) Adjuvant Treatment of HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer ( 2.2 ) Administer at either: \u2022 Initial dose of 4 mg/kg over 90 minutes intravenous infusion, then 2 mg/kg over 30 minutes intravenous infusion weekly for 12 weeks (with paclitaxel or docetaxel) or 18 weeks (with docetaxel and carboplatin). One week after the last weekly dose of TRAZIMERA, administer 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks to complete a total of 52 weeks of therapy, or \u2022 Initial dose of 8 mg/kg over 90 minutes intravenous infusion, then 6 mg/kg over 30 to 90 minutes intravenous infusion every three weeks for 52 weeks. Metastatic HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Initial dose of 4 mg/kg as a 90 minutes intravenous infusion followed by subsequent weekly doses of 2 mg/kg as 30 minutes intravenous infusions. Metastatic HER2-Overexpressing Gastric Cancer ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Initial dose of 8 mg/kg over 90 minutes intravenous infusion, followed by 6 mg/kg over 30 to 90 minutes intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. 2.1 Evaluation and Testing Before Initiating TRAZIMERA Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of TRAZIMERA and at regular intervals during treatment [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of TRAZIMERA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]. 2.2 Patient Selection Select patients based on HER2 protein overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in tumor specimens [see Indications and Usage (1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . Assessment of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification should be performed using FDA-approved tests specific for breast or gastric cancers by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. Information on the FDA-approved tests for the detection of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics . Assessment of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification in metastatic gastric cancer should be performed using FDA-approved tests specifically for gastric cancers due to differences in gastric vs. breast histopathology, including incomplete membrane staining and more frequent heterogeneous expression of HER2 seen in gastric cancers. Improper assay performance, including use of suboptimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents, deviation from specific assay instructions, and failure to include appropriate controls for assay validation, can lead to unreliable results. 2.3 Recommended Dosage \u2022 TRAZIMERA is for intravenous infusion only. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. \u2022 TRAZIMERA has different dosage and administration instructions than subcutaneous trastuzumab products. \u2022 Do not mix TRAZIMERA with other drugs. \u2022 Do not substitute TRAZIMERA (trastuzumab-qyyp) for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer Administer according to one of the following doses and schedules for a total of 52 weeks of TRAZIMERA therapy: During and following paclitaxel, docetaxel, or docetaxel and carboplatin: \u2022 Initial dose of 4 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes then at 2 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes weekly during chemotherapy for the first 12 weeks (paclitaxel or docetaxel) or 18 weeks (docetaxel and carboplatin). \u2022 One week following the last weekly dose of TRAZIMERA, administer TRAZIMERA at 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks. As a single agent within three weeks following completion of multi-modality, anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens: \u2022 Initial dose at 8 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes. \u2022 Subsequent doses at 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks. \u2022 Extending adjuvant treatment beyond one year is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Metastatic Breast Cancer \u2022 Administer TRAZIMERA, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, at an initial dose of 4 mg/kg as a 90-minute intravenous infusion followed by subsequent once weekly doses of 2 mg/kg as 30-minute intravenous infusions until disease progression. Metastatic Gastric Cancer \u2022 Administer TRAZIMERA at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg as a 90-minute intravenous infusion followed by subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks until disease progression. 2.4 Important Dosing Considerations Missed Dose If the patient has missed a dose of TRAZIMERA by one week or less, then the usual maintenance dose (weekly schedule: 2 mg/kg; once every three weeks schedule: 6 mg/kg) should be administered as soon as possible. Do not wait until the next planned cycle. Subsequent TRAZIMERA maintenance doses should be administered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or once every three weeks schedules, respectively. If the patient has missed a dose of TRAZIMERA by more than one week, a re-loading dose of TRAZIMERA should be administered over approximately 90 minutes (weekly schedule: 4 mg/kg; once every three weeks schedule: 8 mg/kg) as soon as possible. Subsequent TRAZIMERA maintenance doses (weekly schedule: 2 mg/kg; once every three weeks schedule: 6 mg/kg) should be administered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or once every three weeks schedules, respectively. 2.5 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Infusion Reactions [See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Decrease the rate of infusion for mild or moderate infusion reactions \u2022 Interrupt the infusion in patients with dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension \u2022 Discontinue TRAZIMERA for severe or life-threatening infusion reactions. Cardiomyopathy [See Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of TRAZIMERA and at regular intervals during treatment. Withhold TRAZIMERA dosing for at least 4 weeks for either of the following: \u2022 \u2265 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values \u2022 LVEF below institutional limits of normal and \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. TRAZIMERA may be resumed if, within 4 to 8 weeks, the LVEF returns to normal limits and the absolute decrease from baseline is \u2264 15%. Permanently discontinue TRAZIMERA for a persistent (> 8 weeks) LVEF decline or for suspension of TRAZIMERA dosing on more than 3 occasions for cardiomyopathy. 2.6 Preparation Instructions To prevent medication errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the drug being prepared and administered is TRAZIMERA (trastuzumab-qyyp) and not ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. 420 mg Multiple-Dose Vial Reconstitution Reconstitute each 420 mg vial of TRAZIMERA with 20 mL of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection (BWFI) containing 1.1% benzyl alcohol as a preservative to yield a multiple-dose solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-qyyp that delivers 20 mL (420 mg trastuzumab-qyyp). In patients with known hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol, reconstitute with 20 mL of Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) without preservative to yield a one-time use solution. Use appropriate aseptic technique when performing the following reconstitution steps: \u2022 Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject the 20 mL of diluent into the vial containing the lyophilized powder of TRAZIMERA, which has a cake-like appearance. The reconstituted vial yields a solution for multiple-dose use, containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-qyyp. \u2022 Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE. \u2022 Slight foaming of the product may be present upon reconstitution. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes. \u2022 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect visually for particulates and discoloration. The solution should be free of visible particulates, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow-brown. \u2022 Store reconstituted TRAZIMERA in the refrigerator at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) ; discard unused TRAZIMERA after 28 days. If TRAZIMERA is reconstituted with SWFI without preservative, use immediately and discard any unused portion. Do not freeze. Dilution \u2022 Determine the dose (mg) of TRAZIMERA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . \u2022 Calculate the volume of the 21 mg/mL reconstituted TRAZIMERA solution needed. \u2022 Withdraw this amount from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. DO NOT USE DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION. \u2022 Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. \u2022 The solution of TRAZIMERA for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride, polyethylene, polypropylene, or ethylene vinyl acetate bags or glass intravenous bottles containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, should be stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for no more than 24 hours prior to use. This storage time is additional to the time allowed for the reconstituted vials. Do not freeze. 150 mg Single-Dose Vial Reconstitution Reconstitute each 150 mg vial of TRAZIMERA with 7.4 mL of Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) (not supplied) to yield a single-dose solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-qyyp that delivers 7.15 mL (150 mg trastuzumab-qyyp). Use appropriate aseptic technique when performing the following reconstitution steps: \u2022 Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 7.4 mL of SWFI (not supplied) into the vial containing the lyophilized powder of TRAZIMERA, which has a cake-like appearance. The reconstituted vial yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-qyyp. \u2022 Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE . \u2022 Slight foaming of the product may be present upon reconstitution. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes. \u2022 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect visually for particulates and discoloration. The solution should be free of visible particulates, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow-brown. \u2022 Use the TRAZIMERA solution immediately following reconstitution with SWFI, as it contains no preservative and is intended for one-time use only. If not used immediately, store the reconstituted TRAZIMERA solution for up to 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) ; discard unused TRAZIMERA after 24 hours. Do not freeze . Dilution \u2022 Determine the dose (mg) of TRAZIMERA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. \u2022 Calculate the volume of the 21 mg/mL reconstituted TRAZIMERA solution needed. \u2022 Withdraw this amount from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. DO NOT USE DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION . \u2022 Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. \u2022 The solution of TRAZIMERA for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride, polyethylene, polypropylene, or ethylene vinyl acetate bags or glass intravenous bottles containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, should be stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for no more than 24 hours prior to use.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) 5.1 Cardiomyopathy Trastuzumab products can cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death [see Boxed Warning ] . Trastuzumab products can also cause asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). There is a 4 to 6 fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction among patients receiving trastuzumab products as a single agent or in combination therapy compared with those not receiving trastuzumab products. The highest absolute incidence occurs when a trastuzumab product is administered with an anthracycline. Withhold TRAZIMERA for \u2265 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values or an LVEF value below institutional limits of normal and \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab products in patients with trastuzumab product-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied. Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping trastuzumab products may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Cardiac Monitoring Conduct thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan. The following schedule is recommended: \u2022 Baseline LVEF measurement immediately prior to initiation of TRAZIMERA \u2022 LVEF measurements every 3 months during and upon completion of TRAZIMERA \u2022 Repeat LVEF measurement at 4 week intervals if TRAZIMERA is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] \u2022 LVEF measurements every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of TRAZIMERA as a component of adjuvant therapy. In NSABP B31, 15% (158/1031) of patients discontinued trastuzumab due to clinical evidence of myocardial dysfunction or significant decline in LVEF after a median follow-up duration of 8.7 years in the AC-TH (anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab) arm. In HERA (one-year trastuzumab treatment), the number of patients who discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up was 2.6% (44/1678). In BCIRG006, a total of 2.9% (31/1056) of patients in the TCH (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab) arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 1.4% during the monotherapy phase) and 5.7% (61/1068) of patients in the AC-TH arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 4.2% during the monotherapy phase) discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity. Among 64 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831) who developed congestive heart failure (CHF), one patient died of cardiomyopathy, one patient died suddenly without documented etiology, and 33 patients were receiving cardiac medication at last follow-up. Approximately 24% of the surviving patients had recovery to a normal LVEF (defined as \u2265 50%) and no symptoms on continuing medical management at the time of last follow-up. Incidence of congestive heart failure is presented in Table 1. The safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab products in patients with trastuzumab product-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied. Table 1: Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure in Adjuvant Breast Cancer Studies Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure % (n) Study Regimen Trastuzumab Control NSABP B31 & NCCTG N9831 Median follow-up duration for NSABP B31 & NCCTG N9831 combined was 8.3 years in the AC\u2192paclitaxel+trastuzumab arm. AC Anthracycline (doxorubicin) and cyclophosphamide. \u2192 Paclitaxel+Trastuzumab 3.2% (64/2000) Includes 1 patient with fatal cardiomyopathy and 1 patient with sudden death without documented etiology. 1.3% (21/1655) HERA Includes NYHA II-IV and cardiac death at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up in the one-year trastuzumab arm.

In post-marketing reports, serious and fatal infusion reactions have been reported. Severe reactions, which include bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypoxia, and severe hypotension, were usually reported during or immediately following the initial infusion. However, the onset and clinical course were variable, including progressive worsening, initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration, or delayed post-infusion events with rapid clinical deterioration. For fatal events, death occurred within hours to days following a serious infusion reaction. Interrupt TRAZIMERA infusion in all patients experiencing dyspnea, clinically significant hypotension, and intervention of medical therapy administered (which may include epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, bronchodilators, and oxygen). Patients should be evaluated and carefully monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Permanent discontinuation should be strongly considered in all patients with severe infusion reactions. There are no data regarding the most appropriate method of identification of patients who may safely be retreated with trastuzumab products after experiencing a severe infusion reaction. Prior to resumption of trastuzumab infusion, the majority of patients who experienced a severe infusion reaction were pre-medicated with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. While some patients tolerated trastuzumab infusions, others had recurrent severe infusion reactions despite pre-medications. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of TRAZIMERA. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to TRAZIMERA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of TRAZIMERA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Trastuzumab product use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity. 5.5 Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: \u2022 Cardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Infusion Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Pulmonary Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Adjuvant Breast Cancer \u2022 Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, and chills. ( 6.1 ) Metastatic Breast Cancer \u2022 Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) are fever, chills, headache, infection, congestive heart failure, insomnia, cough, and rash. ( 6.1 ) Metastatic Gastric Cancer \u2022 Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) are neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 and www.pfizer.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving trastuzumab products in the adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer setting are fever, nausea, vomiting, infusion reactions, diarrhea, infections, increased cough, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, neutropenia, anemia, and myalgia. Adverse reactions requiring interruption or discontinuation of trastuzumab product treatment include CHF, significant decline in left ventricular cardiac function, severe infusion reactions, and pulmonary toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . In the metastatic gastric cancer setting, the most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) that were increased (\u2265 5% difference) in the trastuzumab arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. The most common adverse reactions which resulted in discontinuation of treatment on the trastuzumab-containing arm in the absence of disease progression were infection, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia. Adjuvant Breast Cancer The information below reflects exposure to one-year trastuzumab therapy across three randomized, open-label studies, NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, and HERA, with (n = 3678) or without (n = 3363) trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. HERA Table 3 reflects exposure to trastuzumab in 1678 patients in HERA; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks and median number of infusions was 18 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Table 3: Adverse Reactions (\u2265 1%) in HERA (All Grades) The incidence of Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions was < 1% in both arms for each listed term. Adverse Reactions Trastuzumab (n = 1678) % Observation (n = 1708) % Nervous System Headache 10 3 Paresthesia 2 0.6 Musculoskeletal Arthralgia 8 6 Back pain 5 3 Myalgia 4 1 Bone pain 3 2 Muscle spasm 3 0.2 Infections Nasopharyngitis 8 3 Urinary tract infection 3 0.8 Gastrointestinal Diarrhea 7 1 Nausea 6 1 Vomiting 3.5 0.6 Constipation 2 1 Dyspepsia 2 0.5 Upper abdominal pain 2 1 General Pyrexia 6 0.4 Peripheral edema 5 2 Chills 5 0 Asthenia 4.5 2 Influenza-like illness 2 0.2 Respiratory Thoracic Mediastinal Cough 5 2 Influenza 4 0.5 Dyspnea 3 2 URI 3 1 Rhinitis 2 0.4 Pharyngolaryngeal pain 2 0.5 Sinusitis 2 0.3 Epistaxis 2 0.06 Cardiac Hypertension 4 2 Dizziness 4 2 Ejection fraction decreased 3.5 0.6 Palpitations 3 0.7 Cardiac arrhythmias Higher level grouping term. 3 1 Cardiac failure (congestive) 2 0.3 Skin & Subcutaneous Tissue Rash 4 0.6 Nail disorders 2 0 Pruritus 2 0.6 Clinically relevant adverse reactions in < 1% of patients who received trastuzumab in HERA included hypersensitivity (0.6%), cardiac failure (0.5%), cardiac disorder (0.3%), interstitial pneumonitis (0.2%), pulmonary hypertension (0.2%), ventricular disorder (0.2%), autoimmune thyroiditis (0.3%), and sudden death (0.06%). Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer with Trastuzumab Beyond One Year Extending adjuvant treatment beyond one year is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In HERA, a comparison of trastuzumab administered once every 3 weeks for two years versus one year was performed. The rate of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was increased in the 2-year trastuzumab compared to the 1-year trastuzumab treatment arm (8.1% versus 4.6%, respectively). More patients experienced at least one adverse reaction of Grade 3 or higher in the 2-year trastuzumab treatment arm (20.4%) compared with the one-year trastuzumab treatment arm (16.3%). NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 The safety data from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 were obtained from 3655 patients, of whom 2000 received trastuzumab; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In NSABP B31, only Grade 3 to 5 adverse events, treatment-related Grade 2 events, and Grade 2 to 5 dyspnea were collected during and for up to 3 months following protocol-specified treatment. The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2 to 5 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: fatigue (29.5% vs. 22.4%), infection (24.0% vs. 12.8%), hot flashes (17.1% vs. 15%), anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7%), dyspnea (11.8% vs. 4.6%), rash/desquamation (10.9% vs. 7.6%), leukopenia (10.5% vs. 8.4%), neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3%), headache (6.2% vs. 3.8%), pain (5.5% vs. 3%), edema (4.7% vs. 2.7%), and insomnia (4.3% vs. 1.5%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. In NCCTG N9831, data collection was limited to the following investigator-attributed treatment-related adverse reactions: NCI-CTC Grade 4 and 5 hematologic toxicities, Grade 3 to 5 non-hematologic toxicities, selected Grade 2 to 5 toxicities associated with taxanes (myalgia, arthralgias, nail changes, motor neuropathy, and sensory neuropathy) and Grade 1 to 5 cardiac toxicities occurring during chemotherapy and/or trastuzumab treatment. The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2 to 5 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: arthralgia (12.2% vs. 9.1%), nail changes (11.5% vs. 6.8%), dyspnea (2.4% vs. 0.2%), and diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. BCIRG006 Safety data from BCIRG006 reflect exposure to trastuzumab as part of an adjuvant treatment regimen from 2124 patients receiving at least one dose of study treatment [AC-TH: n = 1068; TCH: n = 1056]. The overall median treatment duration was 54 weeks in both the AC-TH and TCH arms. The median number of infusions was 26 in the AC-TH arm and 30 in the TCH arm, including weekly infusions during the chemotherapy phase and once every three weeks dosing in the monotherapy period [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In BCIRG006, the toxicity profile was similar to that reported in NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, and HERA with the exception of a lower incidence of CHF in the TCH arm. Metastatic Breast Cancer Studies The safety of trastuzumab was evaluated in one randomized, open-label study (H0648g) of chemotherapy with (n = 235) or without (n = 234) intravenous trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in one single-arm study (H0649g) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (n = 222) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients received 4 mg/kg initial dose of trastuzumab followed by 2 mg/kg weekly. In H0648g, 58% of patients received trastuzumab for \u2265 6 months and 9% received trastuzumab for \u2265 12 months, respectively. In H0649g, 31% of patients received trastuzumab for \u2265 6 months and 16% received trastuzumab for \u2265 12 months, respectively. Table 4 shows the adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) in patients from H0648g and H0649g. Table 4: Adverse Reactions Data for trastuzumab single agent were from 4 studies, including 213 patients from H0649g.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (FC+H) (n=294) or chemotherapy alone (FC) (n=290). Patients in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm received trastuzumab 8 mg/kg administered on Day 1 (prior to chemotherapy) followed by 6 mg/kg every 21 days until disease progression. Cisplatin was administered at 80 mg/m 2 on Day 1 and the fluoropyrimidine was administered as either capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 orally twice a day on Days 1 to 14 or 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m 2 /day as a continuous intravenous infusion Days 1 through 5. Chemotherapy was administered for six 21-day cycles. Median duration of trastuzumab treatment was 21 weeks and the median number of trastuzumab infusions administered was eight.

Cardiomyopathy Serial measurement of cardiac function (LVEF) was obtained in clinical trials in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. In HERA, the median duration of follow-up was 12.6 months (12.4 months in the observation arm; 12.6 months in the 1-year trastuzumab arm); and in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, 7.9 years in the AC-T arm, 8.3 years in the AC-TH arm. Following initiation of trastuzumab therapy, the incidence of new-onset dose-limiting myocardial dysfunction was higher among patients receiving trastuzumab and paclitaxel as compared to those receiving paclitaxel alone in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and in patients receiving one-year trastuzumab monotherapy compared to observation in HERA (see Table 6 , Figures 1 and 2 ). The incidence of new-onset cardiac dysfunction, as measured by LVEF, remained similar when compared to the analysis performed at a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC-TH arm. This analysis showed evidence of reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction, with 64.5% of patients who experienced symptomatic CHF in the AC-TH group being asymptomatic at latest follow-up, and 90.3% having full or partial LVEF recovery. Table 6: Myocardial Dysfunction (by LVEF) in NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, HERA and BCIRG006 For NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831 and HERA, events are counted from the beginning of trastuzumab treatment.

Figure 3 BCIRG006: Cumulative Incidence of Time to First LVEF Decline of \u2265 10 Percentage Points from Baseline and to Below 50% with Death as a Competing Risk Event Time 0 is the date of randomization. The incidence of congestive heart failure among patients in the metastatic breast cancer trials was classified for severity using the New York Heart Association classification system (I\u2013IV, where IV is the most severe level of cardiac failure) (see Table 2 ). In the metastatic breast cancer trials, the probability of cardiac dysfunction was highest in patients who received trastuzumab concurrently with anthracyclines. In ToGA, 5% of patients in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm compared to 1.1% of patients in the chemotherapy alone arm had LVEF value below 50% with a \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. Infusion Reactions During the first infusion with trastuzumab, the symptoms most commonly reported were chills and fever, occurring in approximately 40% of patients in clinical trials. Symptoms were treated with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and meperidine (with or without reduction in the rate of trastuzumab infusion); permanent discontinuation of trastuzumab for infusion reactions was required in < 1% of patients. Other signs and/or symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), rigors, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, elevated blood pressure, rash, and asthenia. Infusion reactions occurred in 21% and 35% of patients, and were severe in 1.4% and 9% of patients, on second or subsequent trastuzumab infusions administered as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, respectively. In the post-marketing setting, severe infusion reactions, including hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and angioedema have been reported. Anemia In randomized controlled clinical trials, the overall incidence of anemia (30% vs. 21% [H0648g]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7% [NSABP B31]), and of anemia requiring transfusions (0.1% vs. 0 patients [NCCTG N9831]) were increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Following the administration of trastuzumab as a single agent (H0649g), the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 anemia was < 1%. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer), on the trastuzumab containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the overall incidence of anemia was 28% compared to 21% and of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 anemia was 12.2% compared to 10.3%. Neutropenia In randomized controlled clinical trials in the adjuvant setting, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 4 to 5 neutropenia (1.7% vs. 0.8% [NCCTG N9831]) and of selected Grade 2 to 5 neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3% [NSABP B31]) were increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. In a randomized, controlled trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia (32% vs. 22%) and of febrile neutropenia (23% vs. 17%) were also increased in patients randomized to trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer) on the trastuzumab containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 36.8% compared to 28.9%; febrile neutropenia 5.1% compared to 2.8%. Infection The overall incidences of infection (46% vs. 30% [H0648g]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 infection/febrile neutropenia (24.3% vs. 13.4% [NSABP B31]) and of selected Grade 3 to 5 infection/febrile neutropenia (2.9% vs. 1.4% [NCCTG N9831]) were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. The most common site of infections in the adjuvant setting involved the upper respiratory tract, skin, and urinary tract. In BCIRG006, the overall incidence of infection was higher with the addition of trastuzumab to AC-T but not to TCH [44% (AC-TH), 37% (TCH), 38% (AC-T)]. The incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 infection were similar [25% (AC-TH), 21% (TCH), 23% (AC-T)] across the three arms. In a randomized, controlled trial in treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the reported incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher (23% vs. 17%) in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. Pulmonary Toxicity Adjuvant Breast Cancer Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 pulmonary toxicity (14.3% vs. 5.4% [NSABP B31]) and of selected NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 5 pulmonary toxicity and spontaneous reported Grade 2 dyspnea (3.4% vs. 0.9% [NCCTG N9831]) was higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. The most common pulmonary toxicity was dyspnea (NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5: 11.8% vs. 4.6% [NSABP B31]; NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5: 2.4% vs. 0.2% [NCCTG N9831]). Pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving trastuzumab compared with 0.3% of those receiving chemotherapy alone. Fatal respiratory failure occurred in 3 patients receiving trastuzumab, one as a component of multi-organ system failure, as compared to 1 patient receiving chemotherapy alone. In HERA, there were 4 cases of interstitial pneumonitis in the one-year trastuzumab treatment arm compared to none in the observation arm at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months. Metastatic Breast Cancer Among women receiving trastuzumab for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the incidence of pulmonary toxicity was also increased. Pulmonary adverse events have been reported in the post-marketing experience as part of the symptom complex of infusion reactions. Pulmonary events include bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. For a detailed description, see Warnings and Precautions (5.4). Thrombosis/Embolism In 4 randomized, controlled clinical trials, the incidence of thrombotic adverse events was higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in three studies (2.6% vs. 1.5% [NSABP B31], 2.5% and 3.7% vs. 2.2% [BCIRG006] and 2.1% vs. 0% [H0648g]). Diarrhea Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 diarrhea (6.7% vs. 5.4% [NSABP B31]) and of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 5 diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0% [NCCTG N9831]), and of Grade 1 to 4 diarrhea (7% vs. 1% [HERA; one-year trastuzumab treatment at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up]) were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab as compared to controls. In BCIRG006, the incidence of Grade 3 to 4 diarrhea was higher [5.7% AC-TH, 5.5% TCH vs. 3.0% AC-T] and of Grade 1 to 4 was higher [51% AC-TH, 63% TCH vs. 43% AC-T] among women receiving trastuzumab. Of patients receiving trastuzumab as a single agent for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, 25% experienced diarrhea. An increased incidence of diarrhea was observed in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Renal Toxicity In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer) on the trastuzumab-containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm the incidence of renal impairment was 18% compared to 14.5%. Severe (Grade 3/4) renal failure was 2.7% on the trastuzumab-containing arm compared to 1.7% on the chemotherapy only arm. Treatment discontinuation for renal insufficiency/failure was 2% on the trastuzumab-containing arm and 0.3% on the chemotherapy only arm. In the post-marketing setting, rare cases of nephrotic syndrome with pathologic evidence of glomerulopathy have been reported. The time to onset ranged from 4 months to approximately 18 months from initiation of trastuzumab therapy. Pathologic findings included membranous glomerulonephritis, focal glomerulosclerosis, and fibrillary glomerulonephritis. Complications included volume overload and congestive heart failure. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of trastuzumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Infusion reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Oligohydramnios or oligohydramnios sequence, including pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Glomerulopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] \u2022 Immune thrombocytopenia \u2022 Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Cases of possible TLS have been reported in patients treated with trastuzumab products. Patients with significant tumor burden (e.g. bulky metastases) may be at a higher risk. Patients could present with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS. Providers should consider additional monitoring and/or treatment as clinically indicated."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Verify the pregnancy status of females prior to initiation of TRAZIMERA. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death (see Data ) . Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if a trastuzumab product is used in a pregnant woman or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of a trastuzumab product (see Clinical Considerations ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received TRAZIMERA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal/neonatal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. Data Human Data In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence. Fetal manifestations included pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities and neonatal death. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received trastuzumab either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In most reported cases, amniotic fluid index increased after trastuzumab was stopped. In reported cases where trastuzumab therapy was resumed after amniotic index improved, oligohydramnios recurred. Animal Data In studies where trastuzumab was administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (up to 25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early (Gestation Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation. The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of trastuzumab products in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Published data suggest human IgG is present in human milk but does not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts. Trastuzumab was present in the milk of lactating cynomolgus monkeys but not associated with neonatal toxicity (see Data ). Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's clinical need for TRAZIMERA treatment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from TRAZIMERA or from the underlying maternal condition. This consideration should also take into account the trastuzumab product wash out period of 7 months [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Data In lactating cynomolgus monkeys, trastuzumab was present in breast milk at about 0.3% of maternal serum concentrations after pre-(beginning Gestation Day 120) and post-partum (through Post-partum Day 28) doses of 25 mg/kg administered twice weekly (25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg of trastuzumab products). Infant monkeys with detectable serum levels of trastuzumab did not exhibit any adverse effects on growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of TRAZIMERA. Contraception Females Trastuzumab products can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRAZIMERA and for 7 months following the last dose of TRAZIMERA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of TRAZIMERA in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Trastuzumab has been administered to 386 patients who were 65 years of age or over (253 in the adjuvant treatment and 133 in metastatic breast cancer treatment settings). The risk of cardiac dysfunction was increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger patients in both those receiving treatment for metastatic disease in H0648g and H0649g, or adjuvant therapy in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death (see Data ) . Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if a trastuzumab product is used in a pregnant woman or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of a trastuzumab product (see Clinical Considerations ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received TRAZIMERA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal/neonatal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. Data Human Data In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence. Fetal manifestations included pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities and neonatal death. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received trastuzumab either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In most reported cases, amniotic fluid index increased after trastuzumab was stopped. In reported cases where trastuzumab therapy was resumed after amniotic index improved, oligohydramnios recurred. Animal Data In studies where trastuzumab was administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (up to 25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early (Gestation Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation. The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Trastuzumab-qyyp is a humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein, HER2. Trastuzumab-qyyp is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture. TRAZIMERA (trastuzumab-qyyp) for injection is a sterile, white, preservative-free lyophilized powder with a cake-like appearance, for intravenous administration. Each multiple-dose vial of TRAZIMERA delivers 420 mg trastuzumab-qyyp, 7.9 mg L-histidine, 9.5 mg L-histidine HCl monohydrate, 1.7 mg polysorbate 20, and 386 mg sucrose. Reconstitution with 20 mL of the appropriate diluent (BWFI or SWFI) yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-qyyp that delivers 20 mL (420 mg trastuzumab-qyyp), at a pH of approximately 6. If TRAZIMERA is reconstituted with SWFI without preservative, the reconstituted solution is considered single-dose. Each single-dose vial of TRAZIMERA delivers 150 mg trastuzumab-qyyp, 2.8 mg L-histidine, 3.4 mg L-histidine HCl monohydrate, 0.6 mg polysorbate 20, and 138 mg sucrose. Reconstitution with 7.4 mL of SWFI yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-qyyp that delivers 7.15 mL (150 mg trastuzumab-qyyp), at a pH of approximately 6."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Trastuzumab products have been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Trastuzumab products are mediators of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro , trastuzumab product-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Trastuzumab product exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic responses are not fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effects of trastuzumab on electrocardiographic (ECG) endpoints, including QTc interval duration, were evaluated in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. Trastuzumab had no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval duration and there was no apparent relationship between serum trastuzumab concentrations and change in QTcF interval duration in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab were evaluated in a pooled population pharmacokinetic (PK) model analysis of 1,582 subjects with primarily breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) receiving intravenous trastuzumab. Total trastuzumab clearance increases with decreasing concentrations due to parallel linear and non-linear elimination pathways. Although the average trastuzumab exposure was higher following the first cycle in breast cancer patients receiving the once every three weeks schedule compared to the weekly schedule of trastuzumab, the average steady-state exposure was essentially the same at both dosages. The average trastuzumab exposure following the first cycle and at steady state as well as the time to steady state was higher in breast cancer patients compared to MGC patients at the same dosage; however, the reason for this exposure difference is unknown. Additional predicted trastuzumab exposure and PK parameters following the first trastuzumab cycle and at steady state exposure are described in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. Population PK based simulations indicate that following discontinuation of trastuzumab, concentrations in at least 95% of breast cancer patients and MGC patients will decrease to approximately 3% of the population predicted steady-state trough serum concentration (approximately 97% washout) by 7 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] .

The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab products in patients with severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease with or without hemodialysis, or hepatic impairment are unknown. Drug Interaction Studies There have been no formal drug interaction studies performed with trastuzumab products in humans. Clinically significant interactions between trastuzumab and concomitant medications used in clinical trials have not been observed. Paclitaxel and Doxorubicin Concentrations of paclitaxel and doxorubicin and their major metabolites (i.e., 6-\u03b1 hydroxyl-paclitaxel [POH], and doxorubicinol [DOL], respectively) were not altered in the presence of trastuzumab when used as combination therapy in clinical trials. Trastuzumab concentrations were not altered as part of this combination therapy. Docetaxel and Carboplatin When trastuzumab was administered in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin, neither the plasma concentrations of docetaxel or carboplatin nor the plasma concentrations of trastuzumab were altered. Cisplatin and Capecitabine In a drug interaction substudy conducted in patients in ToGA, the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin, capecitabine and their metabolites were not altered when administered in combination with trastuzumab. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of trastuzumab or of other trastuzumab products. Among 903 women with metastatic breast cancer, human anti-human antibody (HAHA) to trastuzumab was detected in one patient using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This patient did not experience an allergic reaction. Samples for assessment of HAHA were not collected in studies of adjuvant breast cancer. The clinical relevance of the development of anti-trastuzumab antibodies after treatment with trastuzumab is not known."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adjuvant Breast Cancer The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab in women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2 overexpressing breast cancer were evaluated in an integrated analysis of two randomized, open-label, clinical trials (NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831) with a total of 4063 women at the protocol-specified final overall survival analysis, a third randomized, open-label, clinical trial (HERA) with a total of 3386 women at definitive Disease-Free Survival analysis for one-year trastuzumab treatment versus observation, and a fourth randomized, open-label clinical trial with a total of 3222 patients (BCIRG006). NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 In NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by IHC) or gene amplification (by FISH). HER2 testing was verified by a central laboratory prior to randomization (NCCTG N9831) or was required to be performed at a reference laboratory (NSABP B31). Patients with a history of active cardiac disease based on symptoms, abnormal electrocardiographic, radiologic, or left ventricular ejection fraction findings or uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic > 100 mm Hg or systolic > 200 mm Hg) were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (AC\u2192paclitaxel) alone or paclitaxel plus trastuzumab (AC\u2192paclitaxel + trastuzumab). In both trials, patients received four 21-day cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 . Paclitaxel was administered either weekly (80 mg/m 2 ) or every 3 weeks (175 mg/m 2 ) for a total of 12 weeks in NSABP B31; paclitaxel was administered only by the weekly schedule in NCCTG N9831. Trastuzumab was administered at 4 mg/kg on the day of initiation of paclitaxel and then at a dose of 2 mg/kg weekly for a total of 52 weeks. Trastuzumab treatment was permanently discontinued in patients who developed congestive heart failure, or persistent/recurrent LVEF decline [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after the completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure of the combined efficacy analysis was Disease-Free Survival (DFS), defined as the time from randomization to recurrence, occurrence of contralateral breast cancer, other second primary cancer, or death. An additional efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). A total of 3752 patients were included in the joint efficacy analysis of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC\u2192paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm. The pre-planned final OS analysis from the joint analysis included 4063 patients and was performed when 707 deaths had occurred after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC\u2192paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm. The data from both arms in NSABP B31 and two of the three study arms in NCCTG N9831 were pooled for efficacy analyses. The patients included in the DFS analysis had a median age of 49 years (range, 22 to 80 years; 6% > 65 years), 84% were White, 7% Black, 4% Hispanic, and 4% Asian/Pacific Islander. Disease characteristics included 90% infiltrating ductal histology, 38% T1, 91% nodal involvement, 27% intermediate and 66% high grade pathology, and 53% ER+ and/or PR+ tumors. HERA In HERA, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by IHC) or gene amplification (by FISH) as determined at a central laboratory. Patients with node-negative disease were required to have \u2265 T1c primary tumor. Patients with a history of congestive heart failure or LVEF < 55%, uncontrolled arrhythmias, angina requiring medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, poorly controlled hypertension (systolic > 180 mm Hg or diastolic > 100 mm Hg) were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) upon completion of definitive surgery, and at least four cycles of chemotherapy to receive no additional treatment, or one year of trastuzumab treatment or two years of trastuzumab treatment. Patients undergoing a lumpectomy had also completed standard radiotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ disease received systemic adjuvant hormonal therapy at investigator discretion. Trastuzumab was administered with an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg once every three weeks. The major efficacy outcome measure was Disease-Free Survival (DFS), defined as in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831. HERA was designed to compare one and two years of once every three weeks trastuzumab treatment versus observation in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery, established chemotherapy and radiotherapy (if applicable). A protocol-specified interim efficacy analysis comparing one-year trastuzumab treatment to observation was performed at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months in the trastuzumab arm. Among the 3386 patients randomized to the observation (n = 1693) and trastuzumab one-year (n = 1693) treatment arms, the median age was 49 years (range 21 to 80), 83% were White, and 13% were Asian. Disease characteristics: 94% infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 50% ER+ and/or PgR+, 57% node positive, 32% node negative, and in 11% of patients, nodal status was not assessable due to prior neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Ninety-six percent (1055/1098) of patients with node-negative disease had high-risk features: among the 1098 patients with node-negative disease, 49% (543) were ER\u2212 and PgR\u2212, and 47% (512) were ER and/or PgR+ and had at least one of the following high-risk features: pathological tumor size greater than 2 cm, Grade 2 to 3, or age < 35 years. Prior to randomization, 94% of patients had received anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. After the DFS results comparing observation to one-year trastuzumab treatment were disclosed, a prospectively planned analysis that included comparison of one year versus two years of trastuzumab treatment at a median follow-up duration of 8 years was performed. Based on this analysis, extending trastuzumab treatment for a duration of two years did not show additional benefit over treatment for one year [Hazard Ratios of two-years trastuzumab versus one-year trastuzumab treatment in the intent to treat (ITT) population for Disease-Free Survival (DFS) = 0.99 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.13), p-value = 0.90 and Overall Survival (OS) = 0.98 (0.83, 1.15); p-value = 0.78]. BCIRG006 In BCIRG006, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 gene amplification (FISH+ only) as determined at a central laboratory. Patients were required to have either node-positive disease, or node-negative disease with at least one of the following high-risk features: ER/PR-negative, tumor size > 2 cm, age < 35 years, or histologic and/or nuclear Grade 2 or 3. Patients with a history of CHF, myocardial infarction, Grade 3 or 4 cardiac arrhythmia, angina requiring medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease, poorly controlled hypertension (diastolic > 100 mm Hg), any T4 or N2 or known N3 or M1 breast cancer were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (AC-T), doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel plus trastuzumab (AC-TH), or docetaxel and carboplatin plus trastuzumab (TCH). In both the AC-T and AC-TH arms, doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 were administered every 3 weeks for four cycles; docetaxel 100 mg/m 2 was administered every 3 weeks for four cycles. In the TCH arm, docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 and carboplatin (at a target AUC of 6 mg/mL/min as a 30- to 60-minute infusion) were administered every 3 weeks for six cycles. Trastuzumab was administered weekly (initial dose of 4 mg/kg followed by weekly dose of 2 mg/kg) concurrently with either T or TC, and then every 3 weeks (6 mg/kg) as monotherapy for a total of 52 weeks. Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. Disease-Free Survival (DFS) was the major efficacy outcome measure. Among 3222 patients, the median age was 49 (range 22 to 74 years; 6% \u2265 65 years). Disease characteristics included 54% ER+ and/or PR+ and 71% node positive. Prior to randomization, all patients underwent primary surgery for breast cancer. The results for DFS for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, HERA, and BCIRG006 and OS results for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and HERA are presented in Table 9. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the duration of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC\u2192TH arm is presented in Figure 4, and the duration of OS after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC\u2192TH arm is presented in Figure 5. The duration of DFS for BCIRG006 is presented in Figure 6. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the OS hazard ratio was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.74). At 8.3 years of median follow-up [AC\u2192TH], the survival rate was estimated to be 86.9% in the AC\u2192TH arm and 79.4% in the AC\u2192T arm. The final OS analysis results from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 indicate that OS benefit by age, hormone receptor status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size and grade, and surgery/radiation therapy was consistent with the treatment effect in the overall population. In patients \u2264 50 years of age (n = 2197), the OS hazard ratio was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81) and in patients > 50 years of age (n = 1866), the OS hazard ratio was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (ER-positive and/or PR-positive) (n = 2223), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor\u2011negative disease (ER-negative and PR-negative) (n = 1830), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.80). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size \u2264 2 cm (n = 1604), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.71). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size > 2 cm (n = 2448), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.80).

The results are shown in Table 10. The number of events in NCCTG N9831 was small with the exception of the IHC 3+/FISH+ subgroup, which constituted 81% of those with data. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding efficacy within other subgroups due to the small number of events. The number of events in HERA was adequate to demonstrate significant effects on DFS in the IHC 3+/FISH unknown and the FISH+/IHC unknown subgroups.

Both trials studied patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein. Patients were eligible if they had 2 or 3 levels of overexpression (based on a 0 to 3 scale) by immunohistochemical assessment of tumor tissue performed by a central testing lab. Previously Untreated Metastatic Breast Cancer (H0648g) H0648g was a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted in 469 women with metastatic breast cancer who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Tumor specimens were tested by IHC (Clinical Trial Assay, CTA) and scored as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+, with 3+ indicating the strongest positivity. Only patients with 2+ or 3+ positive tumors were eligible (about 33% of those screened). Patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or in combination with trastuzumab given intravenously as a 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by weekly doses of trastuzumab at 2 mg/kg. For those who had received prior anthracycline therapy in the adjuvant setting, chemotherapy consisted of paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 over 3 hours every 21 days for at least six cycles); for all other patients, chemotherapy consisted of anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC: doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 or epirubicin 75 mg/m 2 plus 600 mg/m 2 cyclophosphamide every 21 days for six cycles). Sixty-five percent of patients randomized to receive chemotherapy alone in this study received trastuzumab at the time of disease progression as part of a separate extension study. Based upon the determination by an independent Response Evaluation Committee, the patients randomized to trastuzumab and chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer median time to disease progression (TTP), a higher overall response rate (ORR), and a longer median duration of response (DoR) as compared with patients randomized to chemotherapy alone. Patients randomized to trastuzumab and chemotherapy also had a longer median overall survival (OS) (see Table 11). These treatment effects were observed both in patients who received trastuzumab plus paclitaxel and in those who received trastuzumab plus AC; however, the magnitude of the effects was greater in the paclitaxel subgroup.

Of 222 patients enrolled, 66% had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy, 68% had received two prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease, and 25% had received prior myeloablative treatment with hematopoietic rescue. Patients were treated with a loading dose of 4 mg/kg IV followed by weekly doses of trastuzumab at 2 mg/kg IV. The ORR (complete response + partial response), as determined by an independent Response Evaluation Committee, was 14%, with a 2% complete response rate and a 12% partial response rate. Complete responses were observed only in patients with disease limited to skin and lymph nodes. The overall response rate in patients whose tumors tested as CTA 3+ was 18% while in those that tested as CTA 2+, it was 6%. 14.3 Metastatic Gastric Cancer The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil) were studied in patients previously untreated for metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (ToGA). In this open-label, multi-center trial, 594 patients were randomized 1:1 to trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (FC+H) or chemotherapy alone (FC). Randomization was stratified by extent of disease (metastatic vs. locally advanced), primary site (gastric vs. gastroesophageal junction), tumor measurability (yes vs. no), ECOG performance status (0,1 vs. 2), and fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine vs. 5-fluorouracil). All patients were either HER2 gene amplified (FISH+) or HER2 overexpressing (IHC 3+). Patients were also required to have adequate cardiac function (e.g., LVEF > 50%). On the trastuzumab-containing arm, trastuzumab was administered as an IV infusion at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression. On both study arms cisplatin was administered at a dose of 80 mg/m 2 Day 1 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles as a 2 hour IV infusion. On both study arms, capecitabine was administered at 1000 mg/m 2 dose orally twice daily (total daily dose 2000 mg/m 2 ) for 14 days of each 21 day cycle for 6 cycles. Alternatively, continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) 5-fluorouracil was administered at a dose of 800 mg/m 2 /day from Day 1 through Day 5 every three weeks for 6 cycles. The median age of the study population was 60 years (range: 21 to 83); 76% were male; 53% were Asian, 38% Caucasian, 5% Hispanic, 5% other racial/ethnic groups; 91% had ECOG PS of 0 or 1; 82% had primary gastric cancer and 18% had primary gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Of these patients, 23% had undergone prior gastrectomy, 7% had received prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy, and 2% had received prior radiotherapy. The main outcome measure of ToGA was overall survival (OS), analyzed by the unstratified log-rank test. The final OS analysis based on 351 deaths was statistically significant (nominal significance level of 0.0193). An updated OS analysis was conducted at one year after the final analysis. The efficacy results of both the final and the updated analyses are summarized in Table 13 and Figure 7.

Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for a trastuzumab product [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] ."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous (IV) infusion only. Do not administer as an IV push or bolus. Ontruzant has different dosage and administration instructions than subcutaneous trastuzumab products. ( 2.3 ) Do not substitute Ontruzant (trastuzumab-dttb) for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. ( 2.3 ) Perform HER2 testing using FDA-approved tests by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. ( 1 , 2.2 ) Adjuvant Treatment of HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer ( 2.2 ) Administer at either: Initial dose of 4 mg/kg over 90 minute IV infusion, then 2 mg/kg over 30 minute IV infusion weekly for 12 weeks (with paclitaxel or docetaxel) or 18 weeks (with docetaxel and carboplatin). One week after the last weekly dose of Ontruzant, administer 6 mg/kg as an IV infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks to complete a total of 52 weeks of therapy, or Initial dose of 8 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion, then 6 mg/kg over 30 to 90 minutes IV infusion every three weeks for 52 weeks. Metastatic HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer ( 2.3 ) Initial dose of 4 mg/kg as a 90 minute IV infusion followed by subsequent weekly doses of 2 mg/kg as 30 minute IV infusions. Metastatic HER2-Overexpressing Gastric Cancer ( 2.3 ) Initial dose of 8 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion, followed by 6 mg/kg over 30 to 90 minutes IV infusion every 3 weeks. 2.1 Evaluation and Testing Before Initiating Ontruzant Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of Ontruzant and at regular intervals during treatment. [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Ontruzant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] . 2.2 Patient Selection Select patients based on HER2 protein overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in tumor specimens [see Indications and Usage (1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . Assessment of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification should be performed using FDA-approved tests specific for breast or gastric cancers by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. Information on the FDA-approved tests for the detection of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. Assessment of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification in metastatic gastric cancer should be performed using FDA-approved tests specifically for gastric cancers due to differences in gastric vs. breast histopathology, including incomplete membrane staining and more frequent heterogeneous expression of HER2 seen in gastric cancers. Improper assay performance, including use of suboptimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents, deviation from specific assay instructions, and failure to include appropriate controls for assay validation, can lead to unreliable results. 2.3 Recommended Dosage Ontruzant is for intravenous infusion only. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. Ontruzant has different dosage and administration instructions than subcutaneous trastuzumab products. Do not mix Ontruzant with other drugs. Do not substitute Ontruzant (trastuzumab-dttb) for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer: Administer according to one of the following doses and schedules for a total of 52 weeks of Ontruzant therapy: During and following paclitaxel, docetaxel, or docetaxel and carboplatin: Initial dose of 4 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes then at 2 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes weekly during chemotherapy for the first 12 weeks (paclitaxel or docetaxel) or 18 weeks (docetaxel and carboplatin). One week following the last weekly dose of Ontruzant, administer Ontruzant at 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks. As a single agent within three weeks following completion of multi-modality, anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens: Initial dose at 8 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes Subsequent doses at 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks Extending adjuvant treatment beyond one year is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Metastatic Breast Cancer: Administer Ontruzant, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, at an initial dose of 4 mg/kg as a 90-minute intravenous infusion followed by subsequent once weekly doses of 2 mg/kg as 30-minute intravenous infusions until disease progression. Metastatic Gastric Cancer: Administer Ontruzant at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg as a 90-minute intravenous infusion followed by subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 90 minutes every three weeks until disease progression . 2.4 Important Dosing Considerations Missed Dose If the patient has missed a dose of Ontruzant by one week or less, then the usual maintenance dose (weekly schedule: 2 mg/kg; once every three weeks schedule: 6 mg/kg) should be administered as soon as possible. Do not wait until the next planned cycle. Subsequent Ontruzant maintenance doses should be administered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or once every three weeks schedules, respectively. If the patient has missed a dose of Ontruzant by more than one week, a re-loading dose of Ontruzant should be administered over approximately 90 minutes (weekly schedule: 4 mg/kg; once every three weeks schedule: 8 mg/kg) as soon as possible. Subsequent Ontruzant maintenance doses (weekly schedule: 2 mg/kg; three-weekly schedule 6 mg/kg) should be administered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or once every three weeks schedules, respectively. 2.5 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Infusion Reactions [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Decrease the rate of infusion for mild or moderate infusion reactions Interrupt the infusion in patients with dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension Discontinue Ontruzant for severe or life-threatening infusion reactions. Cardiomyopathy [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of Ontruzant and at regular intervals during treatment. Withhold Ontruzant dosing for at least 4 weeks for either of the following: \u2265 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values LVEF below institutional limits of normal and \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. Ontruzant may be resumed if, within 4 to 8 weeks, the LVEF returns to normal limits and the absolute decrease from baseline is \u226415%. Permanently discontinue Ontruzant for a persistent (> 8 weeks) LVEF decline or for suspension of Ontruzant dosing on more than 3 occasions for cardiomyopathy. 2.6 Preparation Instructions To prevent medication errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the drug being prepared and administered is Ontruzant (trastuzumab-dttb) and not ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan. 420 mg Multiple-dose vial Reconstitution: Reconstitute each 420 mg vial of Ontruzant with 20 mL of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection (BWFI), USP, containing 1.1% benzyl alcohol as a preservative to yield a multiple-dose solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-dttb that delivers 20 mL (420 mg trastuzumab-dttb). In patients with known hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol, reconstitute with 20 mL of Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) without preservative to yield a one-time use solution. Use appropriate aseptic technique when performing the following reconstitution steps: Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject the 20 mL of diluent into the vial containing the lyophilized powder of Ontruzant, which has a cake-like appearance. The stream of diluent should be directed into the cake. The reconstituted vial yields a solution for multiple-dose use, containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-dttb. Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE . Slight foaming of the product may be present upon reconstitution. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect visually for particulates and discoloration. The solution should be free of visible particulates, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. Store reconstituted Ontruzant in the refrigerator at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) ; discard unused Ontruzant after 28 days. If Ontruzant is reconstituted with SWFI without preservative, use immediately and discard any unused portion. Do not freeze . Dilution: Determine the dose (mg) of Ontruzant [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Calculate the volume of the 21 mg/mL reconstituted Ontruzant solution needed, withdraw this amount from the vial and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. DO NOT USE DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION . Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. The solution of Ontruzant for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, should be stored at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) for no more than 24 hours prior to use. This storage time is additional to the time allowed for the reconstituted vials. Do not freeze . 150 mg Single-dose vial Reconstitution: Reconstitute each 150 mg vial of Ontruzant with 7.4 mL of Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) (not supplied) to yield a single-dose solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-dttb that delivers 7.15 mL (150 mg trastuzumab-dttb). Use appropriate aseptic technique when performing the following reconstitution steps: Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 7.4 mL of SWFI (not supplied) into the vial containing the lyophilized powder of Ontruzant, which has a cake-like appearance. The stream of diluent should be directed into the cake. The reconstituted vial yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-dttb. Gently swirl and invert the vial to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE . Slight foaming of the product may be present upon reconstitution. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect visually for particulates and discoloration. The solution should be free of visible particulates, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. Use the Ontruzant solution immediately following reconstitution with SWFI, as it contains no preservative and is intended for one-time use only. If not used immediately, store the reconstituted Ontruzant solution for up to 24 hours at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F); discard any unused Ontruzant after 24 hours. Do not freeze. Dilution: Determine the dose (mg) of Ontruzant [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Calculate the volume of the 21 mg/mL reconstituted Ontruzant solution needed Withdraw this amount from the vial and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. DO NOT USE DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. The solution of Ontruzant for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, should be stored at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) for no more than 24 hours prior to use. Discard after 24 hours. This storage time is additional to the time allowed for the reconstituted vials. Do not freeze ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) 5.1 Cardiomyopathy Trastuzumab products can cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death [see Boxed Warning: Cardiomyopathy ] . Trastuzumab products can also cause asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). There is a 4 to 6 fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction among patients receiving trastuzumab products as a single agent or in combination therapy compared with those not receiving trastuzumab products. The highest absolute incidence occurs when a trastuzumab product is administered with an anthracycline. Withhold Ontruzant for \u2265 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values or an LVEF value below institutional limits of normal and \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab products in patients with trastuzumab product-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied. Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping trastuzumab products may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Cardiac Monitoring: Conduct thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan. The following schedule is recommended: Baseline LVEF measurement immediately prior to initiation of Ontruzant LVEF measurements every 3 months during and upon completion of Ontruzant Repeat LVEF measurement at 4 week intervals if Ontruzant is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] LVEF measurements every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of Ontruzant as a component of adjuvant therapy. In NSABPB31, 15% (158/1031) of patients discontinued trastuzumab due to clinical evidence of myocardial dysfunction or significant decline in LVEF after a median follow-up duration of 8.7 years in the AC-TH (anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab) arm. In HERA (one-year trastuzumab treatment), the number of patients who discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up was 2.6% (44/1678). In BCIRG006, a total of 2.9% (31/1056) of patients in the TCH (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab) arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 1.4% during the monotherapy phase) and 5.7% (61/1068) of patients in the AC-TH arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 4.2% during the monotherapy phase) discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity. Among 64 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831) who developed congestive heart failure, one patient died of cardiomyopathy, one patient died suddenly without documented etiology, and 33 patients were receiving cardiac medication at last follow-up. Approximately 24% of the surviving patients had recovery to a normal LVEF (defined as \u2265 50%) and no symptoms on continuing medical management at the time of last follow-up. Incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) is presented in Table 1. The safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab products in patients with trastuzumab product-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied. Table 1 Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure in Adjuvant Breast Cancer Studies Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure % (n) Study Regimen Trastuzumab Control NSABP B31 & NCCTG N9831 Median follow-up duration for NSABP B31 & NCCTG N9831 combined was 8.3 years in the AC \u2192 paclitaxel+trastuzumab arm. AC Anthracycline (doxorubicin) and cyclophosphamide. \u2192 Paclitaxel + Trastuzumab 3.2% (64/2000) Includes 1 patient with fatal cardiomyopathy and 1 patient with sudden death without documented etiology. 1.3% (21/1655) HERA Includes NYHA II-IV and cardiac death at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up in the one-year trastuzumab arm.

In post-marketing reports, serious and fatal infusion reactions have been reported. Severe reactions, which include bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypoxia, and severe hypotension, were usually reported during or immediately following the initial infusion. However, the onset and clinical course were variable, including progressive worsening, initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration, or delayed post-infusion events with rapid clinical deterioration. For fatal events, death occurred within hours to days following a serious infusion reaction. Interrupt Ontruzant infusion in all patients experiencing dyspnea, clinically significant hypotension, and intervention of medical therapy administered (which may include epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, bronchodilators, and oxygen). Patients should be evaluated and carefully monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Permanent discontinuation should be strongly considered in all patients with severe infusion reactions. There are no data regarding the most appropriate method of identification of patients who may safely be retreated with trastuzumab products after experiencing a severe infusion reaction. Prior to resumption of trastuzumab infusion, the majority of patients who experienced a severe infusion reaction were pre-medicated with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. While some patients tolerated trastuzumab infusions, others had recurrent severe infusion reactions despite pre-medications. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Ontruzant. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to Ontruzant during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of Ontruzant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Trastuzumab product use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity. 5.5 Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

( 6.1 ) Metastatic Breast Cancer Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) are fever, chills, headache, infection, congestive heart failure, insomnia, cough, and rash. ( 6.1 ) Metastatic Gastric Cancer Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) are neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Organon LLC, a subsidiary of Organon & Co., at 1-844-674-3200 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving trastuzumab products in the adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer setting are fever, nausea, vomiting, infusion reactions, diarrhea, infections, increased cough, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, neutropenia, anemia, and myalgia. Adverse reactions requiring interruption or discontinuation of trastuzumab product treatment include CHF, significant decline in left ventricular cardiac function, severe infusion reactions, and pulmonary toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . In the metastatic gastric cancer setting, the most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) that were increased (\u2265 5% difference) in the trastuzumab arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. The most common adverse reactions which resulted in discontinuation of treatment on the trastuzumab-containing arm in the absence of disease progression were infection, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia. Adjuvant Breast Cancer The information below reflects exposure to one-year trastuzumab therapy across three randomized, open-label studies, NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, and HERA, with (n = 3678) or without (n = 3363) trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. HERA Table 3 reflects exposure to trastuzumab in 1678 patients in HERA; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks and median number of infusions was 18 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Table 3 Adverse Reactions (\u22651%) in HERA (All Grades) The incidence of Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions was <1% in both arms for each listed term.

Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer with Trastuzumab Beyond One Year Extending adjuvant treatment beyond one year is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In HERA, a comparison of trastuzumab administered once every 3 weeks for two years versus one year was performed. The rate of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was increased in the 2-year trastuzumab compared to the 1-year trastuzumab treatment arm (8.1% versus 4.6%, respectively). More patients experienced at least one adverse reaction of Grade 3 or higher in the 2-year trastuzumab treatment arm (20.4%) compared with the one-year trastuzumab treatment arm (16.3%). NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 The safety data from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 were obtained from 3655 patients, of whom 2000 received trastuzumab; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In NSABPB31, only Grade 3 to 5 adverse events, treatment-related Grade 2 events, and Grade 2\u22125 dyspnea were collected during and for up to 3 months following protocol-specified treatment. The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2 to 5 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: fatigue (29.5% vs. 22.4%), infection (24.0% vs. 12.8%), hot flashes (17.1% vs. 15.0%), anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7%), dyspnea (11.8% vs. 4.6%), rash/desquamation (10.9% vs. 7.6%), leukopenia (10.5% vs. 8.4%), neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3%), headache (6.2% vs. 3.8%), pain (5.5% vs. 3.0%), edema (4.7% vs. 2.7%), and insomnia (4.3% vs. 1.5%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. In NCCTG N9831, data collection was limited to the following investigator-attributed treatment-related adverse reactions: NCI-CTC Grade 4 and 5 hematologic toxicities, Grade 3 to 5 non-hematologic toxicities, selected Grade 2 to 5 toxicities associated with taxanes (myalgia, arthralgias, nail changes, motor neuropathy, and sensory neuropathy) and Grade 1 to 5 cardiac toxicities occurring during chemotherapy and/or trastuzumab treatment. The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2 to 5 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: arthralgia (12.2% vs. 9.1%), nail changes (11.5% vs. 6.8%), dyspnea (2.4% vs. 0.2%), and diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. BCIRG006 Safety data from BCIRG006 reflect exposure to trastuzumab as part of an adjuvant treatment regimen from 2124 patients receiving at least one dose of study treatment [AC-TH: n = 1068; TCH: n = 1056]. The overall median treatment duration was 54 weeks in both the AC-TH and TCH arms. The median number of infusions was 26 in the AC-TH arm and 30 in the TCH arm, including weekly infusions during the chemotherapy phase and every three week dosing in the monotherapy period [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In BCIRG006, the toxicity profile was similar to that reported in NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, and HERA with the exception of a lower incidence of CHF in the TCH arm. Metastatic Breast Cancer Studies The safety of trastuzumab was evaluated in one randomized, open-label study (H0648g) of chemotherapy with (n = 235) or without (n = 234) intravenous trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast cancerand in one single-arm study (H0649g); in patients with metastatic breast cancer (n=222) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients received 4 mg/kg initial dose of trastuzumab followed by 2 mg/kg weekly. In H0648g, 58% of patients received trastuzumab for \u2265 6 months and 9% received trastuzumab for \u2265 12 months, respectively. In H0649g, 31% of patients received trastuzumab for \u2265 6 months and 16% received trastuzumab for \u2265 12 months, respectively. Table 4 shows the adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) in patients from H0648g and H0649g.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (FC+H) (n=294) or chemotherapy alone (FC) (n=290) Patients in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm received trastuzumab 8 mg/kg administered on Day 1 (prior to chemotherapy) followed by 6 mg/kg every 21 days until disease progression. Cisplatin was administered at 80 mg/m 2 on Day 1 and the fluoropyrimidine was administered as either capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 orally twice a day on Days 1 to 14 or 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m 2 /day as a continuous intravenous infusion Days 1 through 5. Chemotherapy was administered for six 21-day cycles. Median duration of trastuzumab treatment was 21 weeks and the median number of trastuzumab infusions administered was eight.

Cardiomyopathy Serial measurement of cardiac function (LVEF) was obtained in clinical trials in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. In HERA, the median duration of follow-up was 12.6 months (12.4 months in the observation arm; 12.6 months in the 1-year trastuzumab arm); and in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, 7.9 years in the AC-T arm, 8.3 years in the AC-TH arm. Following initiation of trastuzumab therapy, the incidence of new-onset dose-limiting myocardial dysfunction was higher among patients receiving trastuzumab and paclitaxel as compared to those receiving paclitaxel alone in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and in patients receiving one-year trastuzumab monotherapy compared to observation in HERA (see Table 6 , Figures 1 and 2 ). The incidence of new-onset cardiac dysfunction, as measured by LVEF, remained similar when compared to the analysis performed at a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC-TH arm. This analysis showed evidence of reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction, with 64.5% of patients who experienced symptomatic CHF in the AC-TH group being asymptomatic at latest follow-up, and 90.3% having full or partial LVEF recovery. Table 6 Myocardial Dysfunction (by LVEF) in NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, HERA, and BCIRG006 For NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, and HERA, events are counted from the beginning of trastuzumab treatment. For BCIRG006, events are counted from the date of randomization.

BCIRG006: Cumulative Incidence of Time to First LVEF Decline of \u2265 10 Percentage Points from Baseline and to Below 50% with Death as a Competing Risk Event The incidence of congestive heart failure among patients in the metastatic breast cancer trials was classified for severity using the New York Heart Association classification system (I\u2212IV, where IV is the most severe level of cardiac failure) (see Table 2 ). In the metastatic breast cancer trials, the probability of cardiac dysfunction was highest in patients who received trastuzumab concurrently with anthracyclines. In ToGA, 5.0% of patients in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm compared to 1.1% of patients in the chemotherapy alone arm had LVEF value below 50% with a \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Infusion Reactions During the first infusion with trastuzumab, the symptoms most commonly reported were chills and fever, occurring in approximately 40% of patients in clinical trials. Symptoms were treated with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and meperidine (with or without reduction in the rate of trastuzumab infusion); permanent discontinuation of trastuzumab for infusion reactions was required in < 1% of patients. Other signs and/or symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), rigors, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, elevated blood pressure, rash, and asthenia. Infusion reactions occurred in 21% and 35% of patients, and were severe in 1.4% and 9% of patients, on second or subsequent trastuzumab infusions administered as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, respectively. In the post-marketing setting, severe infusion reactions, including hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and angioedema have been reported. Anemia In randomized controlled clinical trials, the overall incidence of anemia (30% vs. 21% [H0648g]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7% [NSABPB31]), and of anemia requiring transfusions (0.1% vs. 0 patients [NCCTG N9831]) were increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Following the administration of trastuzumab as a single agent (H0649g), the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 anemia was < 1%. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer), on the trastuzumab containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the overall incidence of anemia was 28% compared to 21% and of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 anemia was 12.2% compared to 10.3%. Neutropenia In randomized controlled clinical trials in the adjuvant setting, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 4 to 5 neutropenia (1.7% vs. 0.8% [NCCTG N9831]) and of selected Grade 2 to 5 neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3% [NSABPB31]) were increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. In a randomized, controlled trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia (32% vs. 22%) and of febrile neutropenia (23% vs. 17%) were also increased in patients randomized to trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer) on the trastuzumab containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 36.8% compared to 28.9%; febrile neutropenia 5.1% compared to 2.8%. Infection The overall incidences of infection (46% vs. 30% [H0648g]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 infection/febrile neutropenia (24.3% vs. 13.4% [NSABPB31]) and of selected Grade 3 to 5 infection/febrile neutropenia (2.9% vs. 1.4%) [NCCTG N9831]) were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. The most common site of infections in the adjuvant setting involved the upper respiratory tract, skin, and urinary tract. In BCIRG006, the overall incidence of infection was higher with the addition of trastuzumab to AC-T but not to TCH [44% (AC-TH), 37% (TCH), 38% (AC-T)]. The incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 infection were similar [25% (AC-TH), 21% (TCH), 23% (AC-T)] across the three arms. In a randomized, controlled trial in treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the reported incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher (23% vs. 17%) in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. Pulmonary Toxicity Adjuvant Breast Cancer Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 pulmonary toxicity (14.3% vs. 5.4% [NSABPB31]) and of selected NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 5 pulmonary toxicity and spontaneous reported Grade 2 dyspnea (3.4% vs. 0.9% [NCCTG N9831]) was higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. The most common pulmonary toxicity was dyspnea (NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5: 11.8% vs. 4.6% [NSABPB31]; NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5: 2.4% vs. 0.2% [NCCTG N9831]). Pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving trastuzumab compared with 0.3% of those receiving chemotherapy alone. Fatal respiratory failure occurred in 3 patients receiving trastuzumab, one as a component of multi-organ system failure, as compared to 1 patient receiving chemotherapy alone. In HERA, there were 4 cases of interstitial pneumonitis in the one-year trastuzumab treatment arm compared to none in the observation arm at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months. Metastatic Breast Cancer Among women receiving trastuzumab for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the incidence of pulmonary toxicity was also increased. Pulmonary adverse events have been reported in the post-marketing experience as part of the symptom complex of infusion reactions. Pulmonary events include bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. For a detailed description, see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) . Thrombosis/Embolism In 4 randomized, controlled clinical trials, the incidence of thrombotic adverse events was higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in three studies (2.6% vs. 1.5% [NSABPB31], 2.5% and 3.7% vs. 2.2% [BCIRG006] and 2.1% vs. 0% [H0648g]). Diarrhea Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 diarrhea (6.7% vs. 5.4% [NSABPB31]) and of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 5 diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0% [NCCTG N9831]), and of Grade 1 to 4 diarrhea (7% vs. 1% [HERA; one-year trastuzumab treatment at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up]) were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab as compared to controls. In BCIRG006, the incidence of Grade 3 to 4 diarrhea was higher [5.7% AC-TH, 5.5% TCH vs. 3.0% AC-T] and of Grade 1 to 4 was higher [51% AC-TH, 63% TCH vs. 43% AC-T] among women receiving trastuzumab. Of patients receiving trastuzumab as a single agent for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, 25% experienced diarrhea. An increased incidence of diarrhea was observed in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Renal Toxicity In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer) on the trastuzumab-containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm the incidence of renal impairment was 18% compared to 14.5%. Severe (Grade 3/4) renal failure was 2.7% on the trastuzumab-containing arm compared to 1.7% on the chemotherapy only arm. Treatment discontinuation for renal insufficiency/failure was 2% on the trastuzumab-containing arm and 0.3% on the chemotherapy only arm. In the post-marketing setting, rare cases of nephrotic syndrome with pathologic evidence of glomerulopathy have been reported. The time to onset ranged from 4 months to approximately 18 months from initiation of trastuzumab therapy. Pathologic findings included membranous glomerulonephritis, focal glomerulosclerosis, and fibrillary glomerulonephritis. Complications included volume overload and congestive heart failure. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of trastuzumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infusion reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Oligohydramnios or oligohydramnios sequence, including pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Glomerulopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Immune thrombocytopenia Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Cases of possible TLS have been reported in patients treated with trastuzumab products. Patients with significant tumor burden (e.g. bulky metastases) may be at a higher risk. Patients could present with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS. Providers should consider additional monitoring and/or treatment as clinically indicated."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Verify the pregnancy status of females prior to initiation of Ontruzant ( 8.3 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death (see Data ). Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if a trastuzumab product is used in a pregnant woman or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of a trastuzumab product (see Clinical Considerations ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received Ontruzant during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal/neonatal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. Data Human Data In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence. Fetal manifestations included pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received trastuzumab either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In most reported cases, amniotic fluid index increased after trastuzumab was stopped. In reported cases where trastuzumab therapy was resumed after amniotic index improved, oligohydramnios recurred. Animal Data In studies where trastuzumab was administered to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (up to 25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early (Gestation Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation. The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of trastuzumab products in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Published data suggest human IgG is present in human milk but does not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts. Trastuzumab was present in the milk of lactating Cynomolgus monkeys but not associated with neonatal toxicity (see Data ). Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's clinical need for Ontruzant treatment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Ontruzant or from the underlying maternal condition. This consideration should also take into account the trastuzumab product wash out period of 7 months [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Data In lactating cynomolgus monkeys, trastuzumab was present in breast milk at about 0.3% of maternal serum concentrations after pre-(beginning Gestation Day 120) and post-partum (through Post-partum Day 28) doses of 25 mg/kg administered twice weekly (25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg of trastuzumab products). Infant monkeys with detectable serum levels of trastuzumab did not exhibit any adverse effects on growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Ontruzant. Contraception Females Trastuzumab products can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Ontruzant and for 7 months following the last dose of Ontruzant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Ontruzant in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Trastuzumab has been administered to 386 patients who were 65 years of age or over (253 in the adjuvant treatment and 133 in metastatic breast cancer treatment settings). The risk of cardiac dysfunction was increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger patients in both those receiving treatment for metastatic disease in H0648g and H0649g, or adjuvant therapy in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831. Limitations in data collection and differences in study design of the 4 studies of trastuzumab in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer preclude a determination of whether the toxicity profile of trastuzumab in older patients is different from younger patients. The reported clinical experience is not adequate to determine whether the efficacy improvements (ORR, TTP, OS, DFS) of trastuzumab treatment in older patients is different from that observed in patients < 65 years of age for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer), of the 294 patients treated with trastuzumab, 108 (37%) were 65 years of age or older, while 13 (4.4%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed."

The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Trastuzumab has been administered to 386 patients who were 65 years of age or over (253 in the adjuvant treatment and 133 in metastatic breast cancer treatment settings). The risk of cardiac dysfunction was increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger patients in both those receiving treatment for metastatic disease in H0648g and H0649g, or adjuvant therapy in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831. Limitations in data collection and differences in study design of the 4 studies of trastuzumab in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer preclude a determination of whether the toxicity profile of trastuzumab in older patients is different from younger patients. The reported clinical experience is not adequate to determine whether the efficacy improvements (ORR, TTP, OS, DFS) of trastuzumab treatment in older patients is different from that observed in patients < 65 years of age for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer), of the 294 patients treated with trastuzumab, 108 (37%) were 65 years of age or older, while 13 (4.4%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Trastuzumab-dttb is a humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein, HER2. Trastuzumab-dttb is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture. Ontruzant (trastuzumab-dttb) for injection is a sterile, white to pale yellow, preservative-free lyophilized powder with a cake-like appearance, for intravenous administration. Each multiple-dose vial of Ontruzant delivers 420 mg trastuzumab-dttb, 381.4 mg \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose dihydrate, 9.4 mg L-histidine HCl monohydrate, 6.1 mg L-histidine, and 1.7 mg polysorbate 20. Reconstitution with 20 mL of the appropriate diluent (BWFI or SWFI) yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-dttb at a pH of approximately 6. If Ontruzant is reconstituted with SWFI without preservative, the reconstituted solution is considered single-dose. Each single-dose vial of Ontruzant delivers 150 mg trastuzumab-dttb, 136.2 mg \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose dihydrate, 3.4 mg L-histidine HCl monohydrate, 2.2 mg L-histidine, and 0.6 mg polysorbate 20. Reconstitution with 7.4 mL of sterile water for injection (SWFI) yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-dttb that delivers 7.15 mL (150 mg trastuzumab-dttb), at a pH of approximately 6."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Trastuzumab products have been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Trastuzumab products are mediators of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro , trastuzumab product-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Trastuzumab product exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic responses are not fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effects of trastuzumab on electrocardiographic (ECG) endpoints, including QTc interval duration, were evaluated in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. Trastuzumab had no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval duration and there was no apparent relationship between serum trastuzumab concentrations and change in QTcF interval duration in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab were evaluated in a pooled population pharmacokinetic (PK) model analysis of 1,582 subjects with primarily breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) receiving intravenous trastuzumab. Total trastuzumab clearance increases with decreasing concentrations due to parallel linear and non-linear elimination pathways. Although the average trastuzumab exposure was higher following the first cycle in breast cancer patients receiving the once every three week schedule compared to the weekly schedule of trastuzumab, the average steady-state exposure was essentially the same at both dosages. The average trastuzumab exposure following the first cycle and at steady state as well as the time to steady state was higher in breast cancer patients compared to MGC patients at the same dosage; however, the reason for this exposure difference is unknown. Additional predicted trastuzumab exposure and PK parameters following the first trastuzumab cycle and at steady state exposure are described in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. Population PK based simulations indicate that following discontinuation of trastuzumab, concentrations in at least 95% of breast cancer and MGC patients will decrease to approximately 3% of the population predicted steady-state trough serum concentration (approximately 97% washout) by 7 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] .

The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab products in patients with severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease with or without hemodialysis, or hepatic impairment is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies: There have been no formal drug interaction studies performed with trastuzumab products in humans. Clinically significant interactions between trastuzumab and concomitant medications used in clinical trials have not been observed. Paclitaxel and doxorubicin : Concentrations of paclitaxel and doxorubicin and their major metabolites (i.e., 6-\u03b1 hydroxyl-paclitaxel [POH], and doxorubicinol [DOL], respectively) were not altered in the presence of trastuzumab when used as combination therapy in clinical trials. Trastuzumab concentrations were not altered as part of this combination therapy. Docetaxel and carboplatin: When trastuzumab was administered in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin, neither the plasma concentrations of docetaxel or carboplatin nor the plasma concentrations of trastuzumab were altered. Cisplatin and capecitabine : In a drug interaction substudy conducted in patients in ToGA, the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin, capecitabine and their metabolites were not altered when administered in combination with trastuzumab. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of trastuzumab or of other trastuzumab products. Among 903 women with metastatic breast cancer, human anti human antibody (HAHA) to trastuzumab was detected in one patient using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This patient did not experience an allergic reaction. Samples for assessment of HAHA were not collected in studies of adjuvant breast cancer. The clinical relevance of the development of anti-trastuzumab antibodies after treatment with trastuzumab is not known."

NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831: In NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by IHC) or gene amplification (by FISH). HER2 testing was verified by a central laboratory prior to randomization (NCCTG N9831) or was required to be performed at a reference laboratory (NSABPB31). Patients with a history of active cardiac disease based on symptoms, abnormal electrocardiographic, radiologic, or left ventricular ejection fraction findings or uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic > 100 mm Hg or systolic > 200 mm Hg) were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (AC \u2192 paclitaxel) alone or paclitaxel plus trastuzumab (AC \u2192 paclitaxel + trastuzumab). In both trials, patients received four 21-day cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 . Paclitaxel was administered either weekly (80 mg/m 2 ) or every 3 weeks (175 mg/m 2 ) for a total of 12 weeks in NSABPB31; paclitaxel was administered only by the weekly schedule in NCCTG N9831. Trastuzumab was administered at 4 mg/kg on the day of initiation of paclitaxel and then at a dose of 2 mg/kg weekly for a total of 52 weeks. Trastuzumab treatment was permanently discontinued in patients who developed congestive heart failure, or persistent/recurrent LVEF decline [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after the completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure of the combined efficacy analysis was Disease-Free Survival (DFS), defined as the time from randomization to recurrence, occurrence of contralateral breast cancer, other second primary cancer, or death. An additional efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). A total of 3752 patients were included in the joint efficacy analysis of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC \u2192 paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm. The pre-planned final OS analysis from the joint analysis included 4063 patients and was performed when 707 deaths had occurred after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC \u2192 paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm. The data from both arms in NSABPB31 and two of the three study arms in NCCTG N9831 were pooled for efficacy analyses. The patients included in the DFS analysis had a median age of 49 years (range, 22 to 80 years; 6% > 65 years), 84% were White, 7% Black, 4% Hispanic, and 4% Asian/Pacific Islander. Disease characteristics included 90% infiltrating ductal histology, 38% T1, 91% nodal involvement, 27% intermediate and 66% high grade pathology, and 53% ER+ and/or PR+ tumors. HERA: In HERA, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by IHC) or gene amplification (by FISH) as determined at a central laboratory. Patients with node-negative disease were required to have \u2265 T1c primary tumor. Patients with a history of congestive heart failure or LVEF < 55%, uncontrolled arrhythmias, angina requiring medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, poorly controlled hypertension (systolic > 180 mm Hg or diastolic > 100 mm Hg) were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) upon completion of definitive surgery, and at least four cycles of chemotherapy to receive no additional treatment, or one year of trastuzumab treatment or two years of trastuzumab treatment. Patients undergoing a lumpectomy had also completed standard radiotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ disease received systemic adjuvant hormonal therapy at investigator discretion. Trastuzumab was administered with an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg once every three weeks. The major efficacy outcome measure was Disease-Free Survival (DFS), defined as in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831. HERA was designed to compare one and two years of once every three week trastuzumab treatment versus observation in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery, established chemotherapy and radiotherapy (if applicable). A protocol specified interim efficacy analysis comparing one-year trastuzumab treatment to observation was performed at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months in the trastuzumab arm. Among the 3386 patients randomized to the observation (n = 1693) and trastuzumab one-year (n = 1693) treatment arms, the median age was 49 years (range 21 to 80), 83% were White, and 13% were Asian. Disease characteristics: 94% infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 50% ER+ and/or PgR+, 57% node positive, 32% node negative, and in 11% of patients, nodal status was not assessable due to prior neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Ninety-six percent (1055/1098) of patients with node-negative disease had high-risk features: among the 1098 patients with node-negative disease, 49% (543) were ER\u2212 and PgR\u2212, and 47% (512) were ER and/or PgR+ and had at least one of the following high-risk features: pathological tumor size greater than 2 cm, Grade 2 to 3, or age < 35 years. Prior to randomization, 94% of patients had received anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. After the DFS results comparing observation to one-year trastuzumab treatment were disclosed, a prospectively planned analysis that included comparison of one year versus two years of trastuzumab treatment at a median follow-up duration of 8 years was performed. Based on this analysis, extending trastuzumab treatment for a duration of two years did not show additional benefit over treatment for one year [Hazard Ratios of two-years trastuzumab versus one-year trastuzumab treatment in the intent to treat (ITT) population for Disease-Free Survival (DFS) = 0.99 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.13), p-value = 0.90 and Overall Survival (OS) = 0.98 (0.83, 1.15); p-value = 0.78]. BCIRG006: In BCIRG006, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 gene amplification (FISH+ only) as determined at a central laboratory. Patients were required to have either node-positive disease, or node-negative disease with at least one of the following high-risk features: ER/PR-negative, tumor size > 2 cm, age < 35 years, or histologic and/or nuclear Grade 2 or 3. Patients with a history of CHF, myocardial infarction, Grade 3 or 4 cardiac arrhythmia, angina requiring medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease, poorly controlled hypertension (diastolic > 100 mm Hg), any T4 or N2, or known N3 or M1 breast cancer were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (AC-T), doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel plus trastuzumab (AC-TH), or docetaxel and carboplatin plus trastuzumab (TCH). In both the AC-T and AC-TH arms, doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 were administered every 3 weeks for four cycles; docetaxel 100 mg/m 2 was administered every 3 weeks for four cycles. In the TCH arm, docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 and carboplatin (at a target AUC of 6 mg/mL/min as a 30-to 60-minute infusion) were administered every 3 weeks for six cycles. Trastuzumab was administered weekly (initial dose of 4 mg/kg followed by weekly dose of 2 mg/kg) concurrently with either T or TC, and then every 3 weeks (6 mg/kg) as monotherapy for a total of 52 weeks. Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. Disease-Free Survival (DFS) was the major efficacy outcome measure. Among 3222 patients, the median age was 49 (range 22 to 74 years; 6% \u2265 65 years). Disease characteristics included 54% ER+ and/or PR+ and 71% node positive. Prior to randomization, all patients underwent primary surgery for breast cancer. The results for DFS for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, HERA, and BCIRG006 and OS results for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and HERA are presented in Table 9. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the duration of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC \u2192 TH arm is presented in Figure 4, and the duration of OS after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC \u2192 TH arm is presented in Figure 5. The duration of DFS for BCIRG006 is presented in Figure 6. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the OS hazard ratio was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.74). At 8.3 years of median follow-up [AC \u2192 TH], the survival rate was estimated to be 86.9% in the AC \u2192 TH arm and 79.4% in the AC \u2192 T arm. The final OS analysis results from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 indicate that OS benefit by age, hormone receptor status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size and grade, and surgery/radiation therapy was consistent with the treatment effect in the overall population. In patients \u2264 50 years of age (n = 2197), the OS hazard ratio was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81) and in patients > 50 years of age (n = 1866), the OS hazard ratio was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (ER-positive and/or PR-positive) (n = 2223), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (ER-negative and PR-negative) (n = 1830), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.80). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size \u2264 2 cm (n = 1604), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.71). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size > 2 cm (n = 2448), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.80).

The results are shown in Table 10. The number of events in NCCTG N9831 was small with the exception of the IHC 3+/FISH+ subgroup, which constituted 81% of those with data. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding efficacy within other subgroups due to the small number of events. The number of events in HERA was adequate to demonstrate significant effects on DFS in the IHC 3+/FISH unknown and the FISH +/IHC unknown subgroups.

Both trials studied patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein. Patients were eligible if they had 2 or 3 levels of overexpression (based on a 0 to 3 scale) by immunohistochemical assessment of tumor tissue performed by a central testing lab. Previously Untreated Metastatic Breast Cancer (H0648g): H0648g was a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted in 469 women with metastatic breast cancer who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Tumor specimens were tested by IHC (Clinical Trial Assay, CTA) and scored as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+, with 3+ indicating the strongest positivity. Only patients with 2+ or 3+ positive tumors were eligible (about 33% of those screened). Patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or in combination with trastuzumab given intravenously as a 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by weekly doses of trastuzumab at 2 mg/kg. For those who had received prior anthracycline therapy in the adjuvant setting, chemotherapy consisted of paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 over 3 hours every 21 days for at least six cycles); for all other patients, chemotherapy consisted of anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC: doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 or epirubicin 75 mg/m 2 plus 600 mg/m 2 cyclophosphamide every 21 days for six cycles). Sixty-five percent of patients randomized to receive chemotherapy alone in this study received trastuzumab at the time of disease progression as part of a separate extension study. Based upon the determination by an independent Response Evaluation Committee, the patients randomized to trastuzumab and chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer median time to disease progression (TTP), a higher overall response rate (ORR), and a longer median duration of response (DoR) as compared with patients randomized to chemotherapy alone. Patients randomized to trastuzumab and chemotherapy also had a longer median overall survival (OS) (see Table 11 ). These treatment effects were observed both in patients who received trastuzumab plus paclitaxel and in those who received trastuzumab plus AC; however the magnitude of the effects was greater in the paclitaxel subgroup.

Of 222 patients enrolled, 66% had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy, 68% had received two prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease, and 25% had received prior myeloablative treatment with hematopoietic rescue. Patients were treated with a loading dose of 4 mg/kg IV followed by weekly doses of trastuzumab at 2 mg/kg IV. The ORR (complete response + partial response), as determined by an independent Response Evaluation Committee, was 14%, with a 2% complete response rate and a 12% partial response rate. Complete responses were observed only in patients with disease limited to skin and lymph nodes. The overall response rate in patients whose tumors tested as CTA 3+ was 18% while in those that tested as CTA 2+, it was 6%. 14.3 Metastatic Gastric Cancer The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil) were studied in patients previously untreated for metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (ToGA). In this open-label, multi-center trial, 594 patients were randomized 1:1 to trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (FC+H) or chemotherapy alone (FC). Randomization was stratified by extent of disease (metastatic vs. locally advanced), primary site (gastric vs. gastroesophageal junction), tumor measurability (yes vs. no), ECOG performance status (0,1 vs. 2), and fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine vs. 5-fluorouracil). All patients were either HER2 gene amplified (FISH+) or HER2 overexpressing (IHC 3+). Patients were also required to have adequate cardiac function (e.g., LVEF > 50%). On the trastuzumab-containing arm, trastuzumab was administered as an IV infusion at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression. On both study arms cisplatin was administered at a dose of 80 mg/m 2 Day 1 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles as a 2 hour IV infusion. On both study arms, capecitabine was administered at 1000 mg/m 2 dose orally twice daily (total daily dose 2000 mg/m 2 ) for 14 days of each 21 day cycle for 6 cycles. Alternatively, continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) 5-fluorouracil was administered at a dose of 800 mg/m 2 /day from Day 1 through Day 5 every three weeks for 6 cycles. The median age of the study population was 60 years (range: 21\u221283); 76% were male; 53% were Asian, 38% Caucasian, 5% Hispanic, 5% other racial/ethnic groups; 91% had ECOG PS of 0 or 1; 82% had primary gastric cancer and 18% had primary gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Of these patients, 23% had undergone prior gastrectomy, 7% had received prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy, and 2% had received prior radiotherapy. The main outcome measure of ToGA was overall survival (OS), analyzed by the unstratified log\u00ad-rank test. The final OS analysis based on 351 deaths was statistically significant (nominal significance level of 0.0193). An updated OS analysis was conducted at one year after the final analysis. The efficacy results of both the final and the updated analyses are summarized in Table 13 and Figure 7.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For subcutaneous use only. HERCEPTIN HYLECTA has different dosage and administration instructions than intravenous trastuzumab products. Do not administer intravenously. ( 2.3 ) Do not substitute HERCEPTIN HYLECTA for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine. ( 2.3 ) Perform HER2 testing using FDA-approved tests by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. ( 1 , 2.2 ) The recommended dose of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA is 600 mg/10,000 units (600 mg trastuzumab and 10,000 units hyaluronidase) administered subcutaneously over approximately 2-5 minutes once every three weeks. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Evaluation and Testing Before Initiating HERCEPTIN HYLECTA Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] . 2.2 Patient Selection Select patients based on HER2 protein overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in tumor specimens [see Indications and Usage (1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . Assessment of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification should be performed using FDA-approved tests specific for breast cancer by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. Information on the FDA-approved tests for the detection of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. Improper assay performance, including use of suboptimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents, deviation from specific assay instructions, and failure to include appropriate controls for assay validation, can lead to unreliable results. 2.3 Recommended Dosage HERCEPTIN HYLECTA is for subcutaneous use only. HERCEPTIN HYLECTA has different dosage and administration instructions than intravenous trastuzumab products. Do not administer intravenously. Do not substitute HERCEPTIN HYLECTA for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine. The recommended dose of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA is 600 mg/10,000 units (600 mg trastuzumab and 10,000 units hyaluronidase) administered subcutaneously over approximately 2-5 minutes once every three weeks. No loading dose is required. No dose adjustments for patient body weight or for different concomitant chemotherapy regimens are required. Duration of treatment Patients with adjuvant breast cancer should be treated with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA for 52 weeks or until disease recurrence, whichever occurs first; extending treatment in adjuvant breast cancer beyond one year is not recommended. Patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) should be treated with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA until progression of disease. Missed Dose If one dose is missed, it is recommended to administer the next 600 mg/10,000 units dose (i.e. the missed dose) as soon as possible. The interval between subsequent HERCEPTIN HYLECTA doses should not be less than three weeks. 2.4 Dosage Modification for Adverse Reactions Cardiomyopathy [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA and at regular intervals during treatment. Withhold HERCEPTIN HYLECTA dosing for at least 4 weeks for either of the following: \u226516% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values LVEF below institutional limits of normal and \u226510% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. HERCEPTIN HYLECTA may be resumed if, within 4\u20138 weeks, the LVEF returns to normal limits and the absolute decrease from baseline is \u226415%. Permanently discontinue HERCEPTIN HYLECTA for a persistent (>8 weeks) LVEF decline or for suspension of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA dosing on more than 3 occasions for cardiomyopathy. 2.5 Administration and Storage To prevent medication errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the drug being prepared and administered is HERCEPTIN HYLECTA and not ado-trastuzumab emtansine or intravenous trastuzumab. HERCEPTIN HYLECTA should be administered by a healthcare professional. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use vial if particulates or discoloration is present. Discard any unused portion remaining in the vial. HERCEPTIN HYLECTA is for single use only. The 600 mg/10,000 units (600 mg trastuzumab and 10,000 units hyaluronidase) solution is a ready to use solution for injection which does not need to be diluted. To avoid needle clogging, attach the hypodermic injection needle to the syringe immediately prior to administration followed by volume adjustment to 5 mL. HERCEPTIN HYLECTA is compatible with polypropylene and polycarbonate syringe material and stainless steel transfer and injection needles. Prepare the dosing syringe in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. After the solution of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA is withdrawn from the vial and into the syringe, replace the transfer needle with a syringe closing cap. Label the syringe with the peel-off sticker. Administration The injection site should be alternated between the left and right thigh. New injections should be given at least 2.5 cm from the old previous site on healthy skin and never into areas where the skin is red, bruised, tender, or hard, or areas where there are moles or scars. During the treatment course with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA other medicinal products for subcutaneous administration should preferably be injected at different sites. The dose should be administered subcutaneously over approximately 2 to 5 minutes. Storage If the syringe containing HERCEPTIN HYLECTA is not used immediately, then the syringe can be stored in the refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) for up to 24 hours and subsequently at room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) for up to 4 hours. Protect from light. Do not shake or freeze."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia. ( 5.4 , 6.1 ) Hypersensitivity and Administration-Related Reactions (ARRs): Severe ARRs, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA. Monitor patients for systemic hypersensitivity reactions. Permanently discontinue HERCEPTIN HYLECTA in patients who experience anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Cardiomyopathy HERCEPTIN HYLECTA can cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death [see Boxed Warning: Cardiomyopathy ] . HERCEPTIN HYLECTA can also cause asymptomatic decline in LVEF. There is a 4\u20136 fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction among patients receiving trastuzumab as a single agent or in combination therapy compared with those not receiving trastuzumab. The highest absolute incidence occurs when trastuzumab is administered with an anthracycline. The incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction for intravenous trastuzumab and HERCEPTIN HYLECTA was similar in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Withhold HERCEPTIN HYLECTA for \u226516% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values or an LVEF value below institutional limits of normal and \u226510% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . The safety of continuation or resumption of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA in patients with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied. Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping HERCEPTIN HYLECTA may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Cardiac Monitoring Conduct thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan. The following schedule is recommended: Baseline LVEF measurement immediately prior to initiation of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA LVEF measurements every 3 months during and upon completion of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA Repeat LVEF measurement at 4 week intervals if HERCEPTIN HYLECTA is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] LVEF measurements every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA as a component of adjuvant therapy. HERCEPTIN HYLECTA In the HannaH study, the overall percentage of patients with at least one cardiac disorder was similar in both study arms: 15% (44/297) of patients in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm and 14% (42/298) of patients in the intravenous trastuzumab arm. The most frequent cardiac adverse reactions were left ventricular dysfunction [3.4% (10/297) and 4.0% (12/298)], tachycardia [2% (6/297) and 3% (9/298)] and palpitations [2% (6/297) and 1.3% (4/298)] in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm and the intravenous trastuzumab arm, respectively. The incidence of cardiac failure and congestive cardiac failure was 1% (3/297) in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm and <1% (1/298) in the intravenous trastuzumab arm. The proportion of patients in each treatment arm with a significant decrease in LVEF defined as a drop of \u226510% points to an LVEF of <50% was comparable between treatment arms [3.8% (11/297) in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm and 4.2% (12/298) in the intravenous trastuzumab arm]. In patients with lower body weights (<59 kg, the lowest body weight quartile) the fixed-dose used in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm was not associated with an increased risk of cardiac events or significant drop in LVEF. In the SafeHER study, in patients treated with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA , 17% (323/1864) reported a cardiac disorder during the treatment period. Decreased ejection fraction, reported in 4.5% (84/1864) of the patients was the most frequently reported cardiac disorder. Congestive cardiac failure was reported in <1% (10/1864) of patients and <1% (4/1864) of patients reported cardiac failure during the treatment period. One patient reported congestive cardiac failure during the follow-up period. Six percent (111/1864) of the patients treated with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA had an LVEF <50% with a decrease of \u226510 points in LVEF from baseline. Trastuzumab (intravenous formulation): In study NSABP B31 (NCT00004067), 15% (158/1031) of patients discontinued intravenous trastuzumab due to clinical evidence of myocardial dysfunction or significant decline in LVEF after a median follow-up duration of 8.7 years in the AC-TH arm. In the HERA study (one-year intravenous trastuzumab treatment; NCT00045032), the number of patients who discontinued intravenous trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up was 2.6% (44/1678). In the BCIRG006 study (NCT00021255), a total of 2.9% (31/1056) of patients in the TCH arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 1.4% during the monotherapy phase) and 5.7% (61/1068) of patients in the AC-TH arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 4.2% during the monotherapy phase) discontinued intravenous trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity. Among 64 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (studies NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831; NCT00005970) who developed congestive heart failure (CHF), one patient died of cardiomyopathy, one patient died suddenly without documented etiology, and 33 patients were receiving cardiac medication at last follow-up. Approximately 24% of the surviving patients had recovery to a normal LVEF (defined as \u2265 50%) and no symptoms on continuing medical management at the time of last follow-up. Incidence of CHF is presented in Table 1 . The safety of continuation or resumption of intravenous trastuzumab in patients with trastuzumab-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied. Table 1 Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure in Adjuvant Breast Cancer Studies Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure % (n) Study Regimen Intravenous Trastuzumab Control NSABP B31 & NCCTG N9831 Median follow-up duration for studies NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 combined was 8.3 years in the AC\u2192 paclitaxel+Herceptin arm. AC Anthracycline (doxorubicin) and cyclophosphamide. \u2192paclitaxel + intravenous trastuzumab 3.2% (64/2000) Includes 1 patient with fatal cardiomyopathy and 1 patient with sudden death without documented etiology. 1.3% (21/1655) HERA Includes NYHA II-IV and cardiac death at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up in the one-year intravenous trastuzumab arm.

In post-marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to HERCEPTIN HYLECTA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity HERCEPTIN HYLECTA can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity. 5.4 Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia HERCEPTIN HYLECTA may exacerbate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. In randomized, controlled clinical trials with intravenous trastuzumab, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3\u20134 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.5 Hypersensitivity and Administration-Related Reactions Severe administration-related reactions (ARRs), including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, have been reported with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA . Patients experiencing dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of a severe or of a fatal ARR. In the HannaH and SafeHER trials, 9% and 4.2% of patients experienced Grade 1-4 hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, respectively. Grade 3-4 hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions occurred in 1% and <1% of the patients treated with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA, respectively. In the SafeHER trial, 2 patients required permanent treatment discontinuation with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA (1 patient due to a hypersensitivity reaction and 1 patient due to anaphylaxis). Serious and fatal reactions have been reported after treatment with intravenous trastuzumab products. Closely monitor patients for systemic hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first administration. Permanently discontinue HERCEPTIN HYLECTA in patients who experience anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions. Medications to treat such reactions, as well as emergency equipment, should be available for immediate use. For patients experiencing reversible Grade 1 or 2 hypersensitivity reactions, consider pre-medication with an analgesic, antipyretic, or an antihistamine prior to readministration of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Cardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Pulmonary Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity and Administration-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Adjuvant Breast Cancer Most common adverse reactions (\u226510%) for HERCEPTIN HYLECTA are fatigue, arthralgia, diarrhea, injection site reaction, upper respiratory tract infection, rash, myalgia, nausea, headache, edema, flushing, pyrexia, cough, and pain in extremity. ( 6.1 ) Metastatic Breast Cancer (based on intravenous trastuzumab) Most common adverse reactions (\u226510%) are fever, chills, headache, infection, congestive heart failure, insomnia, cough, and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA administered subcutaneously has been established in the HannaH and SafeHER studies conducted in patients with HER2 overexpressing breast cancer. The safety of intravenous trastuzumab has been established in studies H0648g and H0649g conducted in patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Adjuvant Breast Cancer HannaH HannaH was a randomized, open-label study to compare the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA compared to intravenous trastuzumab in women with HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients randomized to the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm received a dose of 600 mg HERCEPTIN HYLECTA every 3 weeks throughout the treatment phase. Patients were treated for 8 cycles in combination with chemotherapy (docetaxel followed by 5FU, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide), then underwent surgery, and continued HERCEPTIN HYLECTA to complete 18 cycles of therapy. The median age of patients was 50 (range: 25-81 years), all patients were female, and a majority of patients were white (67%). The median number of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA cycles received was 18 (range 1-18). The most common adverse reactions of any grade (occurring in \u226510% of patients) with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA were alopecia (63%), nausea (49%), ARRs (48%), neutropenia (44%), diarrhea (34%), asthenia (25%), fatigue (24%), vomiting (23%), myalgia (21%), decreased appetite (20%), stomatitis (19%), arthralgia (18%), headache (17%), rash (16%), constipation (14%), radiation skin injury (14%), pyrexia (12%), cough (12%), anemia (11%), dyspnea (11%), incision site pain (11%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (11%), leukopenia (10%), mucosal inflammation (10%), hot flush (10%), upper respiratory tract infection (10%). The most common Grade \u22653 adverse reactions (occurring in >1% of patients) in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm were neutropenia (30%), febrile neutropenia (6%), leukopenia (4%), diarrhea (3%), hypertension (2%), irregular menstruation (2%), alopecia (1%), nausea (1%), granulocytopenia (1%), vomiting (1%), amenorrhea (1%), and cellulitis (1%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of any study drug in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm occurred in 34% of patients; 31% of patients had these events during the neoadjuvant phase of the study with concurrent chemotherapy and 9% of patients had these events during the adjuvant phase. Overall, the most common (\u2265 1%) were neutropenia (21%), leukopenia (2.4%), ALT increase (1.7%), pyrexia (1.7%), anemia (1%), bronchitis (1%), and left ventricular dysfunction (1%). Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of any study drug in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm (>1 patient) were left ventricular dysfunction (2%). The incidence of ARRs in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm was 48% and was 37% in the intravenous trastuzumab arm. Five (2%) patients in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm experienced a Grade 3 ARR. Three of the events in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm occurred on the day of study drug administration when docetaxel treatment was administered concurrently. The most commonly reported ARRs in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm (\u22655% of patients) were rash, pruritus, erythema, cough and dyspnea. Grade 1 and 2 injection-site reactions (ISRs) occurred in 10% of patients in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm. The most common ISRs were injection-site pain and injection-site erythema. The data in Table 3 were obtained from the HannaH trial for adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 5% of the patients treated with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA.

In SafeHER, 1864 patients were enrolled and treated with 600 mg of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA administered subcutaneously once every three weeks for 18 cycles. The median age of patients was 54 (range: 20-88 years), 99.8% were female, and a majority were white (76%). A majority of the patients received HERCEPTIN HYLECTA concurrently with a chemotherapy regimen (58%). The median number of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA cycles administered was 18 and the median duration of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA exposure was 11.8 months. The median duration of follow-up was 23.7 months. During the treatment period, the most common adverse reactions of any grade (occurring in \u226510% of patients) were ARRs (39%), diarrhea (21%), fatigue (21%), arthralgia (21%), nausea (15%), myalgia (14%), headache (13%), asthenia (12%), pain in extremity (11%), cough (11%), pyrexia (11%), hot flush (10%), and rash (10%). The most common Grade \u22653 adverse reactions (occurring in >1% of patients) were neutropenia (4%), febrile neutropenia (2%), hypertension (2%), leukopenia (1%), and diarrhea (1%). Adverse reactions that led to study drug discontinuation (\u22650.5% of patients) were ejection fraction decreased (2%) and left ventricular dysfunction (1%). The incidence of ARRs was 39%, with Grade \u22653 ARRs reported in 1% of patients treated with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA. The most frequently reported Grade \u22653 ARRs were dyspnea (<1%), cough (<1%), erythema (<1%), rash (<1%), and drug hypersensitivity (<1%). ISRs were reported in 20% of patients treated with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA. The most common ISRs were injection-site erythema (7%) and injection-site pain (6%). All ISRs were Grade 1 or 2, except for one (<1%) Grade 3 injection site discomfort. The data in Table 4 were obtained from the SafeHER trial for adverse reactions that occurred in \u22655% of the patients treated with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA.

Data in Table 5 are based on H0648g and H0649g. Among the 464 patients treated in H0648g, the median age was 52 years (range: 25\u201377 years). Eighty-nine percent were white, 5% black, 1% Asian, and 5% other racial/ethnic groups. All patients received 4 mg/kg initial dose of intravenous trastuzumab followed by 2 mg/kg weekly. The percentages of patients who received intravenous trastuzumab treatment for \u2265 6 months and \u2265 12 months were 58% and 9%, respectively. Among the 352 patients treated in single agent studies (213 patients from H0649g), the median age was 50 years (range 28\u201386 years), 86% were white, 3% were black, 3% were Asian, and 8% in other racial/ethnic groups. Most of the patients received 4 mg/kg initial dose of intravenous trastuzumab followed by 2 mg/kg weekly. The percentages of patients who received intravenous trastuzumab treatment for \u2265 6 months and \u2265 12 months were 31% and 16%, respectively.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Administration-related reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Oligohydramnios or oligohydramnios sequence, including pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Glomerulopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Immune thrombocytopenia Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Cases of possible TLS have been reported in patients treated with trastuzumab. Patients with significant tumor burden (e.g. bulky metastases) may be at a higher risk. Patients could present with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS. Providers should consider additional monitoring and/or treatment as clinically indicated."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Verify the pregnancy status of females prior to initiation of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Pharmacovigilance Program There is a pregnancy pharmacovigilance program for HERCEPTIN HYLECTA. If HERCEPTIN HYLECTA is administered during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving HERCEPTIN HYLECTA or within 7 months following the last dose of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA, health care providers and patients should immediately report HERCEPTIN HYLECTA exposure to Genentech at 1-888-835-2555. Risk Summary HERCEPTIN HYLECTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Data ]. Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if HERCEPTIN HYLECTA is used in a pregnant woman or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA [see Clinical Considerations ]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received HERCEPTIN HYLECTA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal/neonatal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. Data Human Data In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence. Fetal manifestations included pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received trastuzumab either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In most reported cases, amniotic fluid index increased after use of trastuzumab was stopped. In reported cases where Herceptin therapy was resumed after amniotic index improved, oligohydramnios recurred. Animal Data HERCEPTIN HYLECTA for subcutaneous injection contains trastuzumab and hyaluronidase [see Description (11) ] . Trastuzumab : In studies where intravenous trastuzumab was administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (up to 25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early (Gestation Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation. The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects. Hyaluronidase: In an embryo-fetal study, mice have been dosed daily by subcutaneous injection during the period of organogenesis with hyaluronidase (recombinant human) at dose levels up to 2,200,000 U/kg, which is >7,200 times higher than the human dose. The study found no evidence of teratogenicity. Reduced fetal weight and increased numbers of fetal resorptions were observed, with no effects found at a daily dose of 360,000 U/kg, which is >1,200 times higher than the human dose. In a peri-and post-natal reproduction study, mice have been dosed daily by subcutaneous injection, with hyaluronidase (recombinant human) from implantation through lactation and weaning at dose levels up to 1,100,000 U/kg, which is >3,600 times higher than the human dose. The study found no adverse effects on sexual maturation, learning and memory or fertility of the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of trastuzumab or hyaluronidase in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Published data suggest human IgG is present in human milk but does not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts. Trastuzumab was present in the milk of lactating cynomolgus monkeys but not associated with neonatal toxicity (see Data ). Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's clinical need for HERCEPTIN HYLECTA treatment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from HERCEPTIN HYLECTA or from the underlying maternal condition. This consideration should also take into account the trastuzumab wash out period of 7 months [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.3 ]. Data In lactating cynomolgus monkeys, trastuzumab was present in breast milk at about 0.3% of maternal serum concentrations after pre- (beginning Gestation Day 120) and post-partum (through Post-partum Day 28) doses of 25 mg/kg administered twice weekly (25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg of intravenous trastuzumab). Infant monkeys with detectable serum levels of trastuzumab did not exhibit any adverse effects on growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA. Contraception Females HERCEPTIN HYLECTA can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA and for 7 months following the last dose of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in the HannaH and SafeHER studies treated with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA, 19% were 65 and over, while 4.7% were 75 and over. In patients receiving intravenous trastuzumab, the risk of cardiac dysfunction was increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger patients, in both those receiving treatment for adjuvant therapy or metastatic disease. Other differences in safety or effectiveness were not observed between elderly patients and younger patients."

      "11 DESCRIPTION HERCEPTIN HYLECTA is a combination of trastuzumab and hyaluronidase. Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein, HER2. Trastuzumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture. Trastuzumab has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kDa. Hyaluronidase (recombinant human) is an endoglycosidase used to increase the dispersion and absorption of co-administered drugs when administered subcutaneously. It is a glycosylated single-chain protein produced by mammalian (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells containing a DNA plasmid encoding for a soluble fragment of human hyaluronidase (PH20). Hyaluronidase (recombinant human) has a molecular weight of approximately 61 kDa. HERCEPTIN HYLECTA (trastuzumab and hyaluronidase) injection is a sterile, preservative-free, colorless to yellowish, clear to opalescent solution supplied in single-dose vials for subcutaneous administration. HERCEPTIN HYLECTA is supplied as 600 mg trastuzumab and 10,000 units hyaluronidase per 5 mL in single-dose vials. Each mL of solution contains trastuzumab (120 mg), hyaluronidase (2,000 units), L-histidine (0.39 mg), L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (3.67 mg), L-methionine (1.49 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.4 mg), \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose dihydrate (79.45 mg), and Water for Injection."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Trastuzumab is a mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro , trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. Hyaluronan is a polysaccharide found in the extracellular matrix of the subcutaneous tissue. It is depolymerized by the naturally occurring enzyme hyaluronidase. Unlike the stable structural components of the interstitial matrix, hyaluronan has a half-life of approximately 0.5 days. Hyaluronidase increases permeability of the subcutaneous tissue by depolymerizing hyaluronan. In the doses administered, hyaluronidase in HERCEPTIN HYLECTA acts transiently and locally. The effects of hyaluronidase are reversible and permeability of the subcutaneous tissue is restored within 24 to 48 hours. Hyaluronidase has been shown to increase the absorption rate of a trastuzumab product into the systemic circulation when given in the subcutis of G\u00f6ttingen Minipigs. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effects of trastuzumab on electrocardiographic (ECG) endpoints, including QTc interval duration, were evaluated in patients with HER2-positive solid tumors. Trastuzumab had no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval duration and there was no apparent relationship between serum trastuzumab concentrations and change in QTcF interval duration in patients with HER2-positive solid tumors. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Trastuzumab exposure following subcutaneous administration of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA 600 mg every 3 weeks as compared to intravenous trastuzumab 8 mg/kg loading dose, 6 mg/kg maintenance every 3 weeks in the HannaH Study is shown in Table 6 . The pharmacokinetic (PK) results for the co-primary endpoint, C trough pre-dose Cycle 8, showed non-inferiority of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA (78.7 mcg/mL) compared to intravenous trastuzumab (57.8 mcg/mL), with a geometric mean ratio of 1.3 (90% CI: 1.2\u20131.4). A population PK model with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination from the central compartment was constructed using pooled HERCEPTIN HYLECTA and intravenous trastuzumab pharmacokinetic (PK) data from HannaH to describe the observed trastuzumab PK concentrations following HERCEPTIN HYLECTA subcutaneous administration and intravenous trastuzumab administration. Population PK predicted trastuzumab exposure are shown in Table 6 . Following subcutaneous administration of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA, trastuzumab concentrations were approximately at steady-state after the Cycle 7 dose with < 15% increase in concentration up to Cycle 13. The mean C trough at the pre-dose Cycle 18 in HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm is similar to that of Cycle 13, suggesting no further increase after Cycle 13. The mean C max was 32% lower, and the mean AUC 0-21 days following the Cycle 7 dose and Cycle 12 dose was approximately 10% and 20% higher, respectively, in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm than in the intravenous trastuzumab arm. Table 6 Trastuzumab Exposure (median with 5 th -95 th Percentiles) following Subcutaneous Administration of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA or Intravenous Trastuzumab Trastuzumab Exposure HERCEPTIN HYLECTA Intravenous Trastuzumab C trough (mcg/mL) Cycle 1 28.2 (14.8\u201340.9) 29.4 (5.8\u201359.5) Cycle 7 75.0 (35.1\u2013123) 47.4 (5\u2013114.7) C max (mcg/mL) Cycle 1 79.3 (56.1\u2013109) 178 (117\u2013291) Cycle 7 149 (86.1\u2013214) 179 (107\u2013309) AUC 0-21 days (mcg/mL\u2219day) Cycle 1 1065 (718\u20131504) 1373 (736\u20132245) Cycle 7 2337 (1258\u20133478) 1794 (673\u20133618) General PK parameters of trastuzumab following subcutaneous administration of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA are shown in Table 7 . Trastuzumab is estimated to reach concentrations that are < 1 mcg/mL by 7 months in at least 95% patients. Table 7 PK parameters of Trastuzumab following Subcutaneous Administration of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA Parameters represented as geometric mean (%CV) unless otherwise specified Absorption Absolute Bioavailability 0.77 (13) First-order absorption rate, ka (day -1 ) 0.4 (2.92) Residual standard error T max (day) 3 (1-14) Median (range) Distribution Volume of Central Compartment (L) 2.9 (19.1) Elimination Linear Elimination Clearance (L/day) 0.11 (30) Non-linear Elimination V max (mg/day) 11.9 (19.9) Non-linear Elimination K m (mg/L) 33.9 (38.6) Specific Populations Body weight showed a statistically significant influence on PK. In patients with a body weight < 51 kg, mean steady state AUC of trastuzumab was about 80% higher after HERCEPTIN HYLECTA than after intravenous trastuzumab treatment, whereas in the highest BW group (> 90 kg) AUC was 20% lower after HERCEPTIN HYLECTA than after intravenous trastuzumab treatment. However, no body weight based dose adjustments are needed, as the exposure changes are not considered clinically relevant. Drug Interaction Studies There have been no formal drug interaction studies performed with trastuzumab in humans. Clinically significant interactions between trastuzumab and concomitant medications used in clinical trials have not been observed. Paclitaxel and doxorubicin : Concentrations of paclitaxel and doxorubicin and their major metabolites (i.e., 6-\u03b1 hydroxyl-paclitaxel [POH], and doxorubicinol [DOL], respectively) were not altered in the presence of trastuzumab when used as combination therapy in clinical trials. Trastuzumab concentrations were not altered as part of this combination therapy. Docetaxel and carboplatin: When intravenous trastuzumab was administered in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin, neither the plasma concentrations of docetaxel or carboplatin nor the plasma concentrations of trastuzumab were altered. Cisplatin and capecitabine : In a drug interaction substudy conducted in patients in Study BO18255, the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin, capecitabine and their metabolites were not altered when administered in combination with intravenous trastuzumab. 12.6 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to HERCEPTIN HYLECTA and intravenous trastuzumab in the study described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. In the HannaH study, at a median follow-up exceeding 60 months, the incidence of treatment-induced/enhanced anti-trastuzumab antibodies was 10% (30/296) in patients treated with intravenous trastuzumab and 16% (47/295) in patients receiving HERCEPTIN HYLECTA. Neutralizing anti-trastuzumab antibodies were detected in post-baseline samples in 2/30 patients in the intravenous trastuzumab arm and 3/47 patients in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm. The incidence of treatment-induced/enhanced anti-recombinant human hyaluronidase antibodies was 21% (62/295) in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm. None of the patients who tested positive for anti-recombinant human hyaluronidase antibodies tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. The clinical relevance of the development of anti-trastuzumab or anti-recombinant human hyaluronidase antibodies after treatment with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA is not known."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Trastuzumab is a mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro , trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. Hyaluronan is a polysaccharide found in the extracellular matrix of the subcutaneous tissue. It is depolymerized by the naturally occurring enzyme hyaluronidase. Unlike the stable structural components of the interstitial matrix, hyaluronan has a half-life of approximately 0.5 days. Hyaluronidase increases permeability of the subcutaneous tissue by depolymerizing hyaluronan. In the doses administered, hyaluronidase in HERCEPTIN HYLECTA acts transiently and locally. The effects of hyaluronidase are reversible and permeability of the subcutaneous tissue is restored within 24 to 48 hours. Hyaluronidase has been shown to increase the absorption rate of a trastuzumab product into the systemic circulation when given in the subcutis of G\u00f6ttingen Minipigs."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Trastuzumab exposure following subcutaneous administration of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA 600 mg every 3 weeks as compared to intravenous trastuzumab 8 mg/kg loading dose, 6 mg/kg maintenance every 3 weeks in the HannaH Study is shown in Table 6 . The pharmacokinetic (PK) results for the co-primary endpoint, C trough pre-dose Cycle 8, showed non-inferiority of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA (78.7 mcg/mL) compared to intravenous trastuzumab (57.8 mcg/mL), with a geometric mean ratio of 1.3 (90% CI: 1.2\u20131.4). A population PK model with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination from the central compartment was constructed using pooled HERCEPTIN HYLECTA and intravenous trastuzumab pharmacokinetic (PK) data from HannaH to describe the observed trastuzumab PK concentrations following HERCEPTIN HYLECTA subcutaneous administration and intravenous trastuzumab administration. Population PK predicted trastuzumab exposure are shown in Table 6 . Following subcutaneous administration of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA, trastuzumab concentrations were approximately at steady-state after the Cycle 7 dose with < 15% increase in concentration up to Cycle 13. The mean C trough at the pre-dose Cycle 18 in HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm is similar to that of Cycle 13, suggesting no further increase after Cycle 13. The mean C max was 32% lower, and the mean AUC 0-21 days following the Cycle 7 dose and Cycle 12 dose was approximately 10% and 20% higher, respectively, in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm than in the intravenous trastuzumab arm.

In patients with a body weight < 51 kg, mean steady state AUC of trastuzumab was about 80% higher after HERCEPTIN HYLECTA than after intravenous trastuzumab treatment, whereas in the highest BW group (> 90 kg) AUC was 20% lower after HERCEPTIN HYLECTA than after intravenous trastuzumab treatment. However, no body weight based dose adjustments are needed, as the exposure changes are not considered clinically relevant. Drug Interaction Studies There have been no formal drug interaction studies performed with trastuzumab in humans. Clinically significant interactions between trastuzumab and concomitant medications used in clinical trials have not been observed. Paclitaxel and doxorubicin : Concentrations of paclitaxel and doxorubicin and their major metabolites (i.e., 6-\u03b1 hydroxyl-paclitaxel [POH], and doxorubicinol [DOL], respectively) were not altered in the presence of trastuzumab when used as combination therapy in clinical trials. Trastuzumab concentrations were not altered as part of this combination therapy. Docetaxel and carboplatin: When intravenous trastuzumab was administered in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin, neither the plasma concentrations of docetaxel or carboplatin nor the plasma concentrations of trastuzumab were altered. Cisplatin and capecitabine : In a drug interaction substudy conducted in patients in Study BO18255, the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin, capecitabine and their metabolites were not altered when administered in combination with intravenous trastuzumab."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The comparability between HERCEPTIN HYLECTA administered subcutaneously and intravenous trastuzumab was established in the HannaH study. The HannaH study was conducted in patients with HER2 overexpressing breast cancer in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings with co-primary endpoints of pathological complete response (pCR) and the PK endpoint of C trough at cycle 7 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 14.1 Adjuvant Breast Cancer HERCEPTIN HYLECTA HannaH The HannaH study (NCT00950300) was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, clinical trial in 596 patients with HER2-positive operable or locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), including inflammatory breast cancer. HER2-positivity was defined as IHC 3+ or ISH+. Patients were randomized to receive 8 cycles of either HERCEPTIN HYLECTA or intravenous trastuzumab concurrently with chemotherapy (docetaxel followed by 5FU, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide), followed by surgery and continued therapy with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA or intravenous trastuzumab as treated prior to surgery, for an additional 10 cycles, to complete 18 cycles of therapy. HannaH was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of treatment with HERCEPTIN HYLECTA versus intravenous trastuzumab based on co-primary PK and efficacy outcomes (trastuzumab C trough at pre-dose Cycle 8, and pCR rate at definitive surgery, respectively) [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.3 ] . EFS and OS were among other outcomes evaluated in this study. The majority of patients were white (69%) and the median age was 50 years (range: 24-81). The analysis of the efficacy co-primary outcome, pCR, defined as absence of invasive neoplastic cells in the breast, resulted in rates of 45.4% (95% CI: 39.2, 51.7) in the HERCEPTIN HYLECTA arm and 40.7% (95% CI: 34.7, 46.9) in the intravenous trastuzumab arm. Table 8: Summary of Pathological Complete Response (pCR) (HannaH) HERCEPTIN HYLECTA (n=260) Intravenous Trastuzumab (n=263) pCR (absence of invasive neoplastic cells in breast [ypT0/is]) 118 (45.4%) 107 (40.7%) Exact 95% CI for pCR Rate CI for one sample binomial using Pearson-Clopper method (39.2; 51.7) (34.7; 46.9) Difference in pCR (SC minus IV arm) 4.70 95% CI for Difference in pCR Approximate 95% CI for difference of two rates using Hauck-Anderson method (-4.0; 13.4) With a median follow-up exceeding 70 months, no difference in EFS and OS was observed in the final analysis between patients who received intravenous trastuzumab and those who received HERCEPTIN HYLECTA. SafeHER The SafeHER study (NCT01566721) was a prospective, two-cohort, non-randomized, multinational, open-label study designed to assess the overall safety and tolerability of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA with chemotherapy in 1864 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The secondary objectives include the evaluation of DFS and OS. HER2-positivity was defined as IHC 3+ or ISH+. Patients received a fixed dose of 600 mg HERCEPTIN HYLECTA every 3 weeks for a total of 18 cycles throughout the study. HERCEPTIN HYLECTA treatment was initiated either sequentially with chemotherapy, concurrently with chemotherapy, or without adjuvant chemotherapy, or in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by trastuzumab therapy. The majority of treated patients were white (76%) and the median age was 54 years (range: 20-88). In the primary safety analysis (median follow-up 23.7 months), no new safety signals were identified for HERCEPTIN HYLECTA. Safety and tolerability results, including in lower weight patients, were consistent with the known safety profile for HERCEPTIN HYLECTA and intravenous trastuzumab. In the ITT population (n=1867), 126 patients (7%) had a DFS event (recurrence, contralateral invasive breast cancer or death) and 28 patients (1.5%) had an OS event at the time of clinical cut-off. Intravenous Trastuzumab The safety and efficacy of intravenous trastuzumab in women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2 overexpressing breast cancer were evaluated in an integrated analysis of two randomized, open-label, clinical trials (Studies NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831) with a total of 4063 women at the protocol-specified final overall survival analysis, a third randomized, open-label, clinical trial (HERA Study) with a total of 3386 women at definitive DFS analysis for 1-year intravenous trastuzumab treatment versus observation, and a fourth randomized, open-label clinical trial with a total of 3222 patients (Study BCIRG006). Studies NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 In Studies NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by IHC) or gene amplification (by FISH). HER2 testing was verified by a central laboratory prior to randomization (Study NCCTG N9831) or was required to be performed at a reference laboratory (Study NSABP B31). Patients with a history of active cardiac disease based on symptoms, abnormal electrocardiographic, radiologic, or left ventricular ejection fraction findings or uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic > 100 mm Hg or systolic > 200 mm Hg) were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (AC\u2192paclitaxel) alone or paclitaxel plus intravenous trastuzumab (AC\u2192paclitaxel + intravenous trastuzumab). In both trials, patients received four 21-day cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 . Paclitaxel was administered either weekly (80 mg/m 2 ) or every 3 weeks (175 mg/m 2 ) for a total of 12 weeks in Study NSABP B31; paclitaxel was administered only by the weekly schedule in Study NCCTG N9831. Intravenous trastuzumab was administered at 4 mg/kg on the day of initiation of paclitaxel and then at a dose of 2 mg/kg weekly for a total of 52 weeks. Intravenous trastuzumab treatment was permanently discontinued in patients who developed congestive heart failure, or persistent/recurrent LVEF decline [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after the completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. The major efficacy outcome of the combined efficacy analysis was DFS, defined as the time from randomization to recurrence, occurrence of contralateral breast cancer, other second primary cancer, or death. An additional efficacy outcome measure was OS. A total of 3752 patients were included in the joint efficacy analysis of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC\u2192paclitaxel + intravenous trastuzumab arm. The pre-planned final OS analysis from the joint analysis included 4063 patients and was performed when 707 deaths had occurred after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC\u2192paclitaxel + intravenous trastuzumab arm. The data from both arms in Study NSABP B31 and two of the three study arms in Study NCCTG N9831 were pooled for efficacy analyses. The patients included in the DFS analysis had a median age of 49 years (range, 22\u201380 years; 6% > 65 years), 84% were White, 7% Black, 4% Hispanic, and 4% Asian/Pacific Islander. Disease characteristics included 90% infiltrating ductal histology, 38% T1, 91% nodal involvement, 27% intermediate and 66% high grade pathology, and 53% ER+ and/or PR+ tumors. HERA Study In the HERA Study, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by IHC) or gene amplification (by FISH) as determined at a central laboratory. Patients with node-negative disease were required to have \u2265 T1c primary tumor. Patients with a history of congestive heart failure or LVEF < 55%, uncontrolled arrhythmias, angina requiring medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, poorly controlled hypertension (systolic > 180 mm Hg or diastolic > 100 mm Hg) were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) upon completion of definitive surgery, and at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy to receive no additional treatment, or 1 year of intravenous trastuzumab treatment or 2 years of intravenous trastuzumab treatment. Patients undergoing a lumpectomy had also completed standard radiotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ disease received systemic adjuvant hormonal therapy at investigator discretion. Intravenous trastuzumab was administered with an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measure was DFS, defined as in Studies NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831. HERA was designed to compare 1 and 2 years of three-weekly intravenous trastuzumab treatment versus observation in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery, established chemotherapy and radiotherapy (if applicable). A protocol specified interim efficacy analysis comparing one-year intravenous trastuzumab treatment to observation was performed at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months in the intravenous trastuzumab. Among the 3386 patients randomized to the observation (n = 1693) and intravenous trastuzumab one-year (n = 1693) treatment arms, the median age was 49 years (range 21\u201380), 83% were White, and 13% were Asian. Disease characteristics: 94% infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 50% ER+ and/or PgR+, 57% node positive, 32% node negative, and in 11% of patients, nodal status was not assessable due to prior neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Ninety-six percent (1055/1098) of patients with node-negative disease had high-risk features: among the 1098 patients with node-negative disease, 49% (543) were ER\u2013 and PgR\u2013, and 47% (512) were ER+ and/or PgR+ and had at least one of the following high-risk features: pathological tumor size > 2 cm, Grade 2\u20133, or age < 35 years. Prior to randomization, 94% of patients had received anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. After the DFS results comparing observation to one-year intravenous trastuzumab treatment were disclosed, a prospectively planned analysis that included comparison of one year versus two years of intravenous trastuzumab treatment at a median follow-up duration of 8 years was performed. Based on this analysis, extending intravenous trastuzumab treatment for a duration of two years did not show additional benefit over treatment for one year [Hazard Ratios of two-years intravenous trastuzumab versus one-year intravenous trastuzumab treatment in the ITT population for DFS = 0.99 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.13), p = 0.90 and OS = 0.98 (0.83, 1.15); p = 0.78]. BCIRG006 Study In the BCIRG006 Study, breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 gene amplification (FISH+ only) as determined at a central laboratory. Patients were required to have either node-positive disease, or node-negative disease with at least one of the following high-risk features: ER/PR-negative, tumor size > 2 cm, age < 35 years, or histologic and/or nuclear Grade 2 or 3. Patients with a history of CHF, myocardial infarction, Grade 3 or 4 cardiac arrhythmia, angina requiring medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease, poorly controlled hypertension (diastolic > 100 mm Hg), any T4 or N2, or known N3 or M1 breast cancer were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (AC-T), doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel plus intravenous trastuzumab (AC-TH), or docetaxel and carboplatin plus intravenous trastuzumab (TCH). In both the AC-T and AC-TH arms, doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 were administered every 3 weeks for four cycles; docetaxel 100 mg/m 2 was administered every 3 weeks for four cycles. In the TCH arm, docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 and carboplatin (at a target AUC of 6 mg/mL/min as a 30- to 60-minute infusion) were administered every 3 weeks for six cycles. Intravenous trastuzumab was administered weekly (initial dose of 4 mg/kg followed by weekly dose of 2 mg/kg) concurrently with either T or TC, and then every 3 weeks (6 mg/kg) as monotherapy for a total of 52 weeks. Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. DFS was the major efficacy outcome measure. Among 3222 patients, the median age was 49 (range 22 to 74 years; 6% \u2265 65 years). Disease characteristics included 54% ER+ and/or PR+ and 71% node positive. Prior to randomization, all patients underwent primary surgery for breast cancer. The results for DFS for the integrated analysis of Studies NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, HERA, and BCIRG006 and OS results for the integrated analysis of Studies NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and HERA are presented in Table 9 . For Studies NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the duration of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC\u2192TH arm is presented in Figure 1 , and the duration of OS after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC\u2192TH arm is presented in Figure 2 . The duration of DFS for BCIRG006 is presented in Figure 3 . For Studies NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the OS hazard ratio was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.74). At 8.3 years of median follow-up [AC\u2192TH], the survival rate was estimated to be 86.9% in the AC\u2192TH arm and 79.4% in the AC\u2192T arm. The final OS analysis results from Studies NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 indicate that OS benefit by age, hormone receptor status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size and grade, and surgery/radiation therapy was consistent with the treatment effect in the overall population. In patients \u2264 50 years of age (n = 2197), the OS hazard ratio was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81) and in patients > 50 years of age (n = 1866), the OS hazard ratio was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (ER-positive and/or PR-positive) (n = 2223), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (ER-negative and PR-negative) (n = 1830), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.80). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size \u2264 2 cm (n = 1604), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.71). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size > 2 cm (n = 2448), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.80).

The results are shown in Table 10 . The number of events in Study NCCTG N9831 was small with the exception of the IHC 3+/FISH+ subgroup, which constituted 81% of those with data. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding efficacy within other subgroups due to the small number of events. The number of events in HERA was adequate to demonstrate significant effects on DFS in the IHC 3+/FISH unknown and the FISH+/IHC unknown subgroups.

Both trials studied patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein. Patients were eligible if they had level 2 or 3 overexpression (based on a 0 to 3 scale) by immunohistochemical assessment of tumor tissue performed by a central testing lab. Previously Untreated Metastatic Breast Cancer (H0648g) H0648g was a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted in 469 women with metastatic breast cancer who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or in combination with trastuzumab given intravenously as a 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by weekly doses of intravenous trastuzumab at 2 mg/kg. For those who had received prior anthracycline therapy in the adjuvant setting, chemotherapy consisted of paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 over 3 hours every 21 days for at least six cycles); for all other patients, chemotherapy consisted of anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC: doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 or epirubicin 75 mg/m 2 plus 600 mg/m 2 cyclophosphamide every 21 days for six cycles). Sixty-five percent of patients randomized to receive chemotherapy alone in this study received intravenous trastuzumab at the time of disease progression as part of a separate extension study. Based upon the determination by an Independent Response Evaluation Committee, the patients randomized to intravenous trastuzumab and chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer time to disease progression (TTP), a higher overall response rate (ORR), and a longer median duration of response as compared with patients randomized to chemotherapy alone. Patients randomized to intravenous trastuzumab and chemotherapy also had a longer median overall survival (OS) (see Table 11 ). These treatment effects were observed both in patients who received intravenous trastuzumab plus paclitaxel and in those who received intravenous trastuzumab plus AC; however the magnitude of the effects was greater in the paclitaxel subgroup.

Of 222 patients enrolled, 66% had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy, 68% had received two prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease, and 25% had received prior myeloablative treatment with hematopoietic rescue. Patients were treated with a loading dose of 4 mg/kg IV followed by weekly doses of trastuzumab at 2 mg/kg IV. The ORR (complete response + partial response), as determined by an independent Response Evaluation Committee, was 14%, with a 2% complete response rate and a 12% partial response rate. Complete responses were observed only in patients with disease limited to skin and lymph nodes. The overall response rate in patients whose tumors tested as CTA 3+ was 18% while in those that tested as CTA 2+, it was 6%. 14.3 Patient Experience The PrefHER study (NCT01401166) was a randomized, multi-center, two-arm, cross-over trial conducted in 240 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment. One hundred twenty-one patients in arm A received 4 cycles of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA followed by 4 cycles of intravenous trastuzumab and 119 patients in arm B received 4 cycles of intravenous trastuzumab followed by 4 cycles of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA. Both arms received a total of 18 cycles. After Cycle 8, 199 of 231 patients (86%) reported preferring subcutaneous administration of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA over intravenous trastuzumab and the most common reason cited was administration required less time (179/231) in the clinic. After Cycle 8, 29 out of 231 patients (13%) reported preferring intravenous trastuzumab over HERCEPTIN HYLECTA and the most common reason was fewer local injection reactions. Three out of 231 patients (1%) had no preference for the route of administration. Nine out of 240 (3.8%) withdrew from treatment prior to completion of Cycle 8 and did not complete the post-study preference questionnaire."
